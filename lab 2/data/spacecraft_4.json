    "abstract": "Abstract:  The twisted local magnetic field at the front or rear regions of the magnetic\nclouds (MCs) associated with interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is\noften nearly opposite to the direction of the ambient interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF). There is also observational evidence for magnetic reconnection\n(MR) outflows occurring within the boundary layers of MCs. In this paper a MR\nevent located at the western flank of the MC occurring on 2000-10-03 is studied\nin detail. Both the large-scale geometry of the helical MC and the MR outflow\nstructure are scrutinized in a detailed multi-point study. The ICME sheath is\nof hybrid propagation-expansion type. Here the freshly reconnected open field\nlines are expected to slip slowly over the MC resulting in plasma mixing at the\nsame time. As for MR, the current sheet geometry and the vertical motion of the\noutflow channel between ACE-Geotail-WIND spacecraft was carefully studied and\ntested. The main findings on MR include: (1) First-time observation of\nnon-Petschek-type slow-shock-like discontinuities in the inflow regions; (2)\nObservation of turbulent Hall magnetic field associated with a Lorentz force\ndeflected electron jet; (3) Acceleration of protons by reconnection electric\nfield and their back-scatter from the slow shock-like discontinuity; (4)\nObservation of relativistic electron near the MC inflow boundary/separatrix;\nthese electron populations can presumably appear as a result of non-adiabatic\nacceleration, gradient B drift and via acceleration in the electrostatic\npotential well associated with the Hall current system; (5) Observation of\nDoppler shifted ion-acoustic and Langmuir waves in the MC inflow region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We compare the characteristics of flare-accelerated energetic electrons at\nthe Sun with those injected into interplanetary space. We have identified 17\nenergetic electron events well-observed with the SEPT instrument aboard STEREO\nwhich show a clear association with a hard X-ray (HXR) flare observed with the\nRHESSI spacecraft. We compare the spectral indices of the RHESSI HXR spectra\nwith those of the interplanetary electrons. Because of the frequent\ndouble-power-law shape of the in situ electron spectra, we paid special\nattention to the choice of the spectral index used for comparison. The time\ndifference between the electron onsets and the associated type III and\nmicrowave bursts suggests that the electron events are detected at 1 AU with\napparent delays ranging from 9 to 41 minutes. While the parent solar activity\nis clearly impulsive, also showing a high correlation with extreme ultraviolet\njets, most of the studied events occur in temporal coincidence with coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs). In spite of the observed onset delays and presence of\nCMEs in the low corona, we find a significant correlation of about 0.8 between\nthe spectral indices of the HXR flare and the in situ electrons. The\ncorrelations increase if only events with significant anisotropy are\nconsidered. This suggests that transport effects can alter the injected spectra\nleading to a strongly reduced imprint of the flare acceleration. We conclude\nthat interplanetary transport effects must be taken into account when inferring\nthe initial acceleration of solar energetic electron events. Although our\nresults suggest a clear imprint of flare acceleration for the analyzed event\nsample, a secondary acceleration might be present which could account for the\nobserved delays. However, the limited and variable pitch-angle coverage of SEPT\ncould also be the reason for the observed delays.",

Additionally, we introduce a Python tool for downloading and preparing\nSTEREO-HI data, as well as tracking CMEs. In contrast to most previous studies,\nwe use not only science data, which has a relatively high spatial and temporal\nresolution, but also low-quality beacon data, which is - in contrast to science\ndata - provided in real-time by the STEREO-A spacecraft. We do not use data\nfrom the STEREO-B spacecraft. We get a mean absolute error of 8.81 $\\pm$ 3.18 h\n/ 59 $\\pm$ 31 kms$^{-1}$ for arrival time/speed predictions using science data\nand 11.36 $\\pm$ 8.69 h / 106 $\\pm$ 61 kms$^{-1}$ for beacon data. We find that\nusing science data generally leads to more accurate predictions, but using\nbeacon data with the ELEvoHI model is certainly a viable choice in the absence\nof higher resolution real-time data. We propose that these differences could be\nminimized if not eliminated altogether if higher quality real-time data was\navailable, either by enhancing the quality of the already available data or\ncoming from a new mission carrying a HI instrument on-board.",

The turbulent spectrum itself is defined\nby a power-law manifesting the energy cascading process. A break in the\nturbulence spectrum develops near ion scales, signaling the onset of energy\ndissipation. The exact mechanism for the spectral break is still a matter of\ndebate. In this work, we use the 20 Hz \\textit{MESSENGER} magnetic field data\nduring four planetary flybys at different heliocentric distances to examine the\nnature of the spectral break in the solar wind. %By carefully selecting the\nspacecraft trajectory, We relate the spectral break frequencies of the solar\nwind MHD turbulence, found in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ Hz, with the\nwell-known characteristic spectral bump at frequencies $\\sim 1$ Hz upstream of\nplanetary bow shocks. Spectral breaks and spectral bumps during three planetary\nflybys are identified from the \\textit{MESSENGER} observations, with\nheliocentric distances in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ au.

The success of its coronagraph\ninstrument ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems) depends on\nthe ability to stabilize the wavefront from a large segmented mirror such that\noptical path differences are limited to tens of picometers RMS during an\nexposure time of a few hours. In order to relax the constraints on the\nmechanical stability, ECLIPS will be equipped with a wavefront sensing and\ncontrol (WS&C) architecture to correct wavefront errors up to temporal\nfrequencies >~1 Hz. These errors may be dominated by spacecraft structural\ndynamics exciting vibrations at the segmented primary mirror. In this work, we\npresent detailed simulations of the WS&C system within the ECLIPS instrument\nand the resulting contrast performance. This study assumes wavefront\naberrations based on a finite element model of a simulated telescope with\nspacecraft structural dynamics. Wavefront residuals are then computed according\nto a model of the adaptive optics system that includes numerical propagation to\nsimulate a realistic wavefront sensor and an analytical model of the temporal\nperformance. An end-to-end numerical propagation model of ECLIPS is then used\nto estimate the residual starlight intensity distribution at the science\ndetector. We show that the contrast performance depends strongly on the target\nstar magnitude and the spatio-temporal distribution of wavefront errors from\nthe telescope. In cases with significant vibration, we advocate for the use of\nlaser metrology to mitigate high temporal frequency wavefront errors and\nincrease the mission yield.",

This survey paper\nprovides a detailed overview of recent advances, successes, and promising\ndirections for optimization-based space vehicle control. The considered\napplications include planetary landing, rendezvous and proximity operations,\nsmall body landing, constrained attitude reorientation, endo-atmospheric flight\nincluding ascent and reentry, and orbit transfer and injection. The primary\nfocus is on the last ten years of progress, which have seen a veritable rise in\nthe number of applications using three core technologies: lossless\nconvexification, sequential convex programming, and model predictive control.\nThe reader will come away with a well-rounded understanding of the\nstate-of-the-art in each space vehicle control application, and will be well\npositioned to tackle important current open problems using convex optimization\nas a core technology.",

For the first time,\ndifferent space spectrometers will be located at wide angles to each other,\nallowing three-dimensional (3D) spectroscopy of the solar atmosphere. The aim\nof this work is to prepare the methodology to facilitate the reconstruction of\n3D vector velocities from two stereoscopic LOS Doppler velocity measurements\nusing the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) onboard the Solar\nOrbiter and the near-Earth spectrometers, while widely separated in space. We\ndevelop the methodology using the libraries designed earlier for the STEREO\nmission but applied to spectroscopic data from the Hinode mission and the Solar\nDynamics Observatory. We use well-known methods of static and dynamic solar\nrotation stereoscopy and the methods of EUV stereoscopic triangulation for\noptically thin coronal EUV plasma emissions. We develop new algorithms using\nanalytical geometry in space to determine the 3D velocity in coronal loops. We\ndemonstrate our approach with the reconstruction of 3D velocity vectors in\nplasma flows along \"open\" and \"closed\" magnetic loops. This technique will be\napplied to an actual situation of two spacecraft at different separations with\nspectrometers onboard (SPICE versus the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS) and Hinode imaging spectrometer) during the Solar Orbiternominal phase.\nWe summarise how these observations can be coordinated.",

To this end, its\nEnergetic Particle Detector (EPD) has now been in operation, providing\nexcellent data, for just over a year. EPD measures suprathermal and energetic\nparticles in the energy range from a few keV up to (near-) relativistic\nenergies (few MeV for electrons and about 500 MeV/nuc for ions). We present an\noverview of the initial results from the first year of operations and we\nprovide a first assessment of issues and limitations. During this first year of\noperations of the Solar Orbiter mission, EPD has recorded several particle\nevents at distances between 0.5 and 1 au from the Sun. We present dynamic and\ntime-averaged energy spectra for ions that were measured with a combination of\nall four EPD sensors, namely: the SupraThermal Electron and Proton sensor\n(STEP), the Electron Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph\n(SIS), and the High-Energy Telescope (HET) as well as the associated energy\nspectra for electrons measured with STEP and EPT. We illustrate the\ncapabilities of the EPD suite using the 10-11 December 2020 solar particle\nevent. This event showed an enrichment of heavy ions as well as $^3$He, for\nwhich we also present dynamic spectra measured with SIS. The high anisotropy of\nelectrons at the onset of the event and its temporal evolution is also shown\nusing data from these sensors. We discuss the ongoing in-flight calibration and\na few open instrumental issues using data from the 21 July and the 10-11\nDecember 2020 events and give guidelines and examples for the usage of the EPD\ndata. We explain how spacecraft operations may affect EPD data and we present a\nlist of such time periods in the appendix. A list of the most significant\nparticle enhancements as observed by EPT during this first year is also\nprovided.",

As a result, renewed interest in the exploitation of\nthese orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the\npotential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In\nthis paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve\naerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and\nresistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric\npropulsion (ABEP) for sustained drag compensation or mitigation in VLEO.\nAttitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic\nforces and torques in VLEO are also discussed. These system models are\nintegrated into a framework for concept-level satellite design and this\napproach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs for future EO\nspacecraft enabled by these new technologies. A case-study presented for an\noptical very-high resolution spacecraft demonstrates the significant potential\nof reducing orbital altitude using these technologies and indicates possible\nsavings of up to 75% in system mass and over 50% in development and\nmanufacturing costs in comparison to current state-of-the-art missions. For a\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the reduction in mass and cost with\naltitude were shown to be smaller, though it was noted that currently available\ncost models do not capture recent commercial advancements in this segment...",

Also, in\nsimulations the generation of such structures is associated with strong plasma\nheating. Here, we compare four-point measurements in the terrestrial\nmagnetosheath turbulence from the Multiscale magnetospheric mission (MMS) of\nthe flow vorticity and the magnetic field curlometer versus their corresponding\none-point proxies PVI(V) and PVI(B) based on the Partial Variance of Increments\n(PVI) method. We show that the one-point proxies are sufficiently precise in\nidentifying not only the generic features of the current sheets and vortices\nstatistically, but also their appearance in groups associated with plasma\nheating. The method has been further applied to the region of the turbulent\nsheath of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) observed at L1 by WIND\nspacecraft. We observe current sheets and vorticity associated heating in\nlarger groups (blobs), which so far have not been considered in the literature\non turbulent data analysis. The blobs represent extended spatial regions of\nactivity with enhanced regional correlations between the occurrence of\nconditioned currents and vorticity, which at the same time are also correlated\nwith enhanced temperatures. This heating mechanism is substantially different\nfrom the plasma heating in the vicinity of the ICME shock, where plasma beta is\nstrongly fluctuating and there is no vorticity. The proposed method describes a\nnew pathway for linking the plasma heating and plasma turbulence, and it is\nrelevant to in-situ observations when only single spacecraft measurements are\navailable.",

This paper presents the methods to measure the frequency\nand phase fluctuations of the spacecraft radio signal, and the applications to\nstudy the characteristics of the plasma turbulence effects on the signal at a\nsingle station and at multiple stations via cross-correlation. The power\nspectra of the frequency fluctuations observed between 4.9 and 76.3 $\\rm R_{s}$\nhave a power-law shape close to a Kolmogorov spectrum over the frequency\ninterval $ \\nu_{lo}< \\nu <\\nu_{up}$, where the nominal value of $\\nu_{lo}$ is\nset to 3 mHz and $\\nu_{up}$ is in the range of 0.03 $\\sim$ 0.15 Hz. The RMS of\nthe frequency fluctuations is presented as a function of the heliocentric\ndistance. Furthermore, we analyse the variations of the electron column density\nfluctuations at solar offsets 4.9 $\\rm{R_{s}}$ and 9.9 $\\rm{R_{s}}$ and the\ncross-correlation products between the VLBI stations. The power density of the\ndifferential fluctuations between different stations decreases at $\\nu < 0.01$\nHz. Finally, the fast flow speeds of solar wind $>700$ $\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ are\nderived from the cross-correlation of frequency fluctuations at $\\nu < 0.01$\nHz. The fast flow speeds of solar wind correspond to the high heliolatitude of\nthe coronal region that the radio rays passed.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Euclid is an ESA mission designed to constrain the properties of dark energy\nand gravity via weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. It will carry\nout a wide area imaging and spectroscopy survey (EWS) in visible and\nnear-infrared, covering roughly 15,000 square degrees of extragalactic sky on\nsix years. The wide-field telescope and instruments are optimized for pristine\nPSF and reduced straylight, producing very crisp images. This paper presents\nthe building of the Euclid reference survey: the sequence of pointings of EWS,\nDeep fields, Auxiliary fields for calibrations, and spacecraft movements\nfollowed by Euclid as it operates in a step-and-stare mode from its orbit\naround the Lagrange point L2. Each EWS pointing has four dithered frames; we\nsimulate the dither pattern at pixel level to analyse the effective coverage.\nWe use up-to-date models for the sky background to define the Euclid\nregion-of-interest (RoI). The building of the reference survey is highly\nconstrained from calibration cadences, spacecraft constraints and background\nlevels; synergies with ground-based coverage are also considered. Via\npurposely-built software optimized to prioritize best sky areas, produce a\ncompact coverage, and ensure thermal stability, we generate a schedule for the\nAuxiliary and Deep fields observations and schedule the RoI with EWS transit\nobservations. The resulting reference survey RSD_2021A fulfills all constraints\nand is a good proxy for the final solution. Its wide survey covers 14,500\nsquare degrees. The limiting AB magnitudes ($5\\sigma$ point-like source)\nachieved in its footprint are estimated to be 26.2 (visible) and 24.5\n(near-infrared); for spectroscopy, the H$_\\alpha$ line flux limit is $2\\times\n10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1600 nm; and for diffuse emission the\nsurface brightness limits are 29.8 (visible) and 28.4 (near-infrared) mag\narcsec$^{-2}$.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Epoxy resins are used extensively in composite materials for a wide range of\nengineering applications, including structural components of aircraft and\nspacecraft. The processing of fiber-reinforced epoxy composite structures\nrequires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin\nand form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing\nparameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product\nintegrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing\nmust be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental\ncharacterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is\ndifficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are\nneeded. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally\nvalidated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a\nreactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of\nan epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and\nmechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used\nto predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a\nfunction of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical\nand mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process.\nThese results are important for future processing modeling efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Resonances with electromagnetic whistler-mode waves are the primary driver\nfor the formation and dynamics of energetic electron fluxes in various space\nplasma systems, including shock waves and planetary radiation belts. The basic\nand most elaborated theoretical framework for the description of the integral\neffect of multiple resonant interactions is the quasi-linear theory, that\noperates through electron diffusion in velocity space. The quasi-linear\ndiffusion rate scales linearly with the wave intensity, D(QL) is proportional\nto Bw2, which should be small enough to satisfy the applicability criteria of\nthis theory. Spacecraft measurements, however, often detect whistle-mode waves\nsufficiently intense to resonate with electrons nonlinearly. Such nonlinear\nresonant interactions imply effects of phase trapping and phase bunching, which\nmay quickly change the electron fluxes in a non-diffusive manner. Both regimes\nof electron resonant interactions (diffusive and nonlinear) are well studied,\nbut there is no theory quantifying the transition between these two regimes. In\nthis paper we describe the integral effect of nonlinear electron interactions\nwith whistler-mode waves in terms of the time-scale of electron distribution\nrelaxation, is about inverse D(NL). We determine the scaling of D(NL) with wave\nintensity Bw2 and other main wave characteristics, such as wave-packet size.\nThe comparison of D(QL) and D(NL) provides the range of wave intensity and\nwave-packet sizes where the electron distribution evolves at the same rates for\nthe diffusive and nonlinear resonant regimes. The obtained results are\ndiscussed in the context of energetic electron dynamics in the Earth's\nradiation belt.",

In 2029+, Comet-I will hitch a ride to a Sun-Earth L2\nquasi-halo orbit, as a co-passenger of ESA's M4 ARIEL mission. It will then\nremain idle at the L2 point until the right departure conditions are met to\nintercept a yet-to-be-discovered long period comet (or interstellar body). The\nfact that Comet-I target is thus unidentified becomes a key aspect of the\ntrajectory and mission design. The paper first analyses the long period comet\npopulation and concludes that 2 to 3 feasible targets a year should be\nexpected. Yet, Comet-I will only be able to access some of these, depending\nmostly on the angular distance between the Earth and the closest nodal point to\nthe Earth's orbit radius. A preliminary analysis of the transfer trajectories\nhas been performed to assess the trade-off between the accessible region and\nthe transfer time for a given spacecraft design, including a fully chemical, a\nfully electric and a hybrid propulsion system. The different Earth escape\noptions also play a paramount role to enhance Comet-I capability to reach\npossible long period comet targets. Particularly, Earth-leading intercept\nconfigurations have the potential to benefit the most from lunar swing-by\ndepartures. Finally, a preliminary Monte Carlo analysis shows that Comet-I has\na 95 to 99% likelihood of successfully visit a pristine newly-discovered long\nperiod comet in less than 6 years of mission timespan.",

Tail morphology\nsuggests that the dust is optically dominated by ~0.1-1 mm radius grains\nproduced in the prior year. Neither narrowband imaging photometry nor\nspectrophotometry reveal any definitive gas emission, placing 3-sigma upper\nbounds on CN production of <1e23 molec/s at both of the latter two epochs.\nTrajectory analysis indicates that large (>1 mm) grains ejected at extremely\nlarge heliocentric distances (r>30 au) are most strongly favored to reach\nVenus. The flux of such meteors on Venus, and thus their potential direct or\nindirect observability, is highly uncertain as the comet's dust production\nhistory is poorly constrained at these distances, but will likely fall well\nbelow the meteor flux from comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring)'s closer encounter\nto Mars in 2014, and thus poses negligible risk to any spacecraft in orbit\naround Venus. Dust produced in previous apparitions will not likely contribute\nsubstantially to the meteor flux, nor will dust from any future activity apart\nfrom an unlikely high speed (>0.5 km/s) dust outburst prior to the comet\nreaching r~2 au in 2021 September.",

We compare single-species,\nballistic and collisional O2, H2 and H2O atmospheres, as well as an O2+H2O\natmosphere to 3-species atmospheres which contain H2 in varying amounts.\nBecause the H2O vapor pressure is extremely sensitive to the surface\ntemperatures, the density drops several order of magnitude with increasing\ndistance from the subsolar point, and the flow transitions from collisional to\nballistic accordingly. In an O2+H2O atmosphere the local temperatures are\ndetermined by H2O near the subsolar point and transition with increasing\ndistance from the subsolar point to being determined by O2 When radiolytically\nproduced H2 is not negligible in O2+H2O+H2 atmospheres, this much lighter\nmolecule, with a scale height roughly an order of magnitude larger than that\nfor the heavier species, can cool the local temperatures via collisions. In\naddition, if the H2 component is dense enough, particles originating on the\nday-side and precipitating into the night-side atmosphere deposit energy via\ncollisions, which in turn heats the local atmosphere relative to the surface\ntemperature. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this study on\nthe presence of H2 in Callisto's atmosphere and how the simulated densities\ncorrelate with expected detection thresholds at flyby altitudes of the proposed\nJUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft.",

As\nsuch, it may be used for resolved imaging of extended sources, such as\nexoplanets, not possible otherwise. To use the SGL, a spacecraft carrying a\nmodest telescope and a coronagraph must reach the SGLs focal region, that\nbegins at $\\sim$550 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and is oriented\noutward along the line connecting the distant object and the Sun. No spacecraft\nhas ever reached even a half of that distance; and to do so within a reasonable\nmission lifetime (e.g., less than 25 years) and affordable cost requires a new\ntype of mission design, using solar sails and microsats ($<100$~kg). The payoff\nis high -- using the SGL is the only practical way we can ever get a\nhigh-resolution, multi-pixel image of an Earth-like exoplanet, one that we\nidentify as potentially habitable. This paper describes a novel mission design\nstarting with a rideshare launch from the Earth, spiraling in toward the Sun,\nand then flying around it to achieve solar system exit speeds of over $20$\nAU/year. A new sailcraft design is used to make possible high area to mass\nratio for the sailcraft. The mission design enables other fast solar system\nmissions, starting with a proposed very low cost technology demonstration\nmission (TDM) to prove the functionality and operation of the microsat-solar\nsail design and then, building on the TDM, missions to explore distant regions\nof the solar system, and those to study Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) and the\nrecently discovered interstellar objects (ISOs) are also possible.",

We employ ion and electron spectrometers in tandem to support the\nmagnetic field measurements and confirm that the signatures are indeed mirror\nmodes. Wedged against the magnetic pile-up boundary, the low-frequency\nsignatures lasted on average ~10 s with corresponding sizes of the order of\n15-30 upstream solar wind proton thermal gyroradii, or 10-20 proton gyroradii\nin the immediate wake of the quasi-perpendicular bow shock. Their peak-to-peak\namplitudes were of the order of 30-35 nT with respect to the background field,\nand appeared as a mixture of dips and peaks, suggesting that they may have been\nat different stages in their evolution. Situated in a marginally stable plasma\nwith $\\beta_{||}\\sim 1$, we hypothesise that these so-called magnetic bottles,\ncontaining a relatively higher energy and denser ion population with respect to\nthe background plasma, were formed upstream of the spacecraft behind the\nquasi-perpendicular shock. These signatures are very reminiscent of magnetic\nbottles found at other unmagnetised objects such as Venus and comets, also\ninterpreted as mirror modes.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar gravitational moments $J_{2n}$ are important astronomical\nquantities whose precise determination is relevant for solar physics,\ngravitational theory and high precision astrometry and celestial mechanics.\nAccordingly, we propose in the present work to calculate new values of $J_{2n}$\n(for $n$=1,2,3,4 and 5) using recent two-dimensional rotation rates inferred\nfrom the high resolution SDO/HMI helioseismic data spanning the whole solar\nactivity cycle 24. To this aim, a general integral equation relating $J_{2n}$\nto the solar internal density and rotation is derived from the structure\nequations governing the equilibrium of slowly rotating stars. For comparison\npurpose, the calculations are also performed using rotation rates obtained from\na recently improved analysis of SoHO/MDI heliseismic data for solar cycle 23.\nIn agreement with earlier findings, the results confirmed the sensitivity of\nhigh order moments ($n>1$) to the radial and latitudinal distribution of\nrotation in the convective zone. The computed value of the quadrupole moment\n$J_{2}$ ($n=1$) is in accordance with recent measurements of the precession of\nMercury's perihelion deduced from high precision ranging data of the MESSENGER\nspacecraft. The theoretical estimate of the related solar oblateness\n$\\Delta_{\\odot}$ is consistent with the most accurate space-based\ndeterminations, particularly the one from RHESSI/SAS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context: Late on 2013 August 19, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, MESSENGER, Mars Odyssey,\nand the L1 spacecraft, spanning a longitudinal range of 222\u00b0 in the\necliptic plane, observed an energetic particle flux increase. The widespread\nsolar energetic particle (SEP) event was associated with a coronal mass\nejection (CME) that came from a region located near the far-side central\nmeridian from Earth's perspective. The CME erupted in two stages, and was\naccompanied by a late M-class flare observed as a post-eruptive arcade,\npersisting low-frequency (interplanetary) type II and groups of\nshock-accelerated type III radio bursts, all of them making this SEP event\nunusual. Aims: There are two main objectives of this study, disentangling the\nreasons for the different intensity-time profiles observed by the spacecraft,\nespecially at MESSENGER and STEREO-A locations, longitudinally separated by\nonly 15\u00b0, and unravelling the single solar source related with the\nwidespread SEP event. Results: The solar source associated with the widespread\nSEP event is the shock driven by the CME, as the flare observed as a\npost-eruptive arcade is too late to explain the estimated particle onset. The\ndifferent intensity-time profiles observed by STEREO-A, located at 0.97 au, and\nMESSENGER, at 0.33 au, can be interpreted as enhanced particle scattering\nbeyond Mercury's orbit. The longitudinal extent of the shock does not explain\nby itself the wide spread of particles in the heliosphere. The particle\nincrease observed at L1 may be attributed to cross-field diffusion transport,\nand this is also the case for STEREO-B, at least until the spacecraft is\neventually magnetically connected to the shock when it reaches ~0.6 au.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Technologies have often been observed to improve exponentially over time. In\npractice this often means identifying a constant known as the doubling time,\ndescribing the time period over which the technology roughly doubles in some\nmeasure of performance or of performance per dollar. Moore's law is,\nclassically, the empirical observation that the number of electronic components\nthat can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months to 2 years. Today it is\nfrequently stated as the number of computations available per unit of cost.\nGeneralized to the appropriate doubling time, it describes the rate of\nadvancement in many technologies. A frequently noted competitor to Moore's law\nis known as Wright's law, which has aeronautical roots. Wright's law (also\ncalled power law, experience curve and Henderson's law) relates some quality of\na manufactured unit (for Wright, airplanes) to the volume of units\nmanufactured. The Wright's law equation expresses the idea that performance -\nprice or a quality metric - improves according to a power of the number\nproduced, or alternatively stated, improves by a constant percentage for every\ndoubling of the total number produced.\nDoes exploration of outer space conform to Moore's law or Wright's law-like\nbehavior? Our results below are broadly consistent with these laws. This is\ntrue for many technologies. Although the two laws can make somewhat different\npredictions, Sahal found that they converge to the same predictions when\nmanufacturing volume increases exponentially over time. When space exploration\ntransitions into an independent commercial sector, as many people hope and\nexpect, spacecraft technology will then likely enter an era of unambiguously\nexponential advancement.",

Therefore, these stars are not expected to\nbe delta Scuti stars, which pulsate in multiple radial and nonradial modes with\nperiods of around 2 hours. As part of the NASA TESS Guest Investigator Program,\nwe proposed photometric observations in 2-minute cadence for samples of bright\n(visual magnitudes around 7-8) Am stars. Our 2020 SAS meeting paper reported on\nobservations of 21 stars, finding one delta Scuti star and two delta Scuti /\ngamma Doradus hybrid candidates, as well as many stars with photometric\nvariability possibly caused by rotation and starspots. Here we present an\nupdate including 34 additional stars observed up to February 2021, among them\nthree delta Scuti stars and two delta Scuti / gamma Doradus hybrid candidates.\nConfirming the pulsations in these stars requires further data analysis and\nfollow-up observations, because of possible background stars or contamination\nin the TESS CCD pixels with scale 21 arc sec per pixel.

These sensors\nare used to measure or compensate for all non-gravitational accelerations of\nthe host spacecraft so that they can be removed in the data analysis to recover\nspacecraft motion due to Earth's gravity field, which is the main science\nobservable. Low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking missions like GRACE-FO that\nutilize laser ranging interferometers are technologically limited by the\nacceleration noise performance of their electrostatic accelerometers, in\naddition to temporal aliasing associated with Earth's dynamic gravity field.\nThe S-GRS is estimated to be at least 40 times more sensitive than the GRACE\naccelerometers and more than 500 times more sensitive if operated on a\ndrag-compensated platform. The improved performance is enabled by increasing\nthe mass of the sensor's test mass, increasing the gap between the test mass\nand its electrode housing, removing the small grounding wire used in the GRACE\naccelerometers and replacing them with a UV LED-based charge management system.\nThis level of improvement allows future missions to fully take advantage of the\nsensitivity of the GRACE-FO laser Ranging Interferometer in the gravity\nrecovery analysis. The S-GRS concept is a simplified version of the\nflight-proven LISA Pathfinder GRS. Our performance estimates are based on\nmodels vetted during the LISA Pathfinder flight and the expected Earth orbiting\nspacecraft environment based on flight data from GRACE-FO. The relatively low\nvolume, mass, and a power consumption enables use of the S-GRS on ESPA-class\nmicrosatellites, reducing launch costs or enabling larger numbers of satellite\npairs to be utilized to improve the temporal resolution of Earth gravity field\nmaps.",

Time-delay interferometry (TDI) suppresses LFN to an acceptable level by\nlinearly combining measurements from individual spacecraft delayed by durations\nthat correspond to their relative separations. Knowledge of the delay durations\nis crucial for TDI effectiveness. The work reported here extends upon previous\nstudies using data-driven methods for inferring the delays during the\npost-processing of raw phasemeter data, also known as TDI ranging (TDIR). Our\nTDIR analysis uses Bayesian methods designed to ultimately be included in the\nLISA data model as part of a \"Global Fit\" analysis pipeline. Including TDIR as\npart of the Global Fit produces GW inferences which are marginalized over\nuncertainty in the spacecraft separations and allows for independent estimation\nof the spacecraft orbits. We demonstrate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\ninferences of the six time-independent delays required in the rigidly rotating\napproximation of the spacecraft configuration (TDI 1.5) using simulated data.\nThe MCMC uses fractional delay interpolation (FDI) to digitally delay the raw\nphase meter data, and we study the sensitivity of the analysis to the filter\nlength. Varying levels of complexity in the noise covariance matrix are also\nexamined. Delay estimations are found to result in LFN suppression well below\nthe level of secondary noises and constraints on the armlengths to\n$\\mathcal{O}(30)\\ {\\rm cm}$ over the ${\\sim}2.5\\ {\\rm Gm}$ baseline.",

This work uses a\nsophisticated algorithm developed to analyze and characterize separately the\nthree populations - core, halo and strahl - of the eVDF up to 2 keV. The eVDF\ndata are calibrated using independent electron parameters obtained from the\nquasi-thermal noise around the electron plasma frequency measured by the\nThermal Noise Receiver. The code determines the respective set of total\nelectron, core, halo and strahl parameters through non-linear least-square fits\nto the measured eVDF, taking properly into account spacecraft charging and\nother instrumental effects. We use four years, ~ 280000 independent\nmeasurements of core, halo and strahl parameters to investigate the statistical\nproperties of these different populations in the solar wind. We discuss the\ndistributions of their respective densities, drift velocities, temperature, and\ntemperature anisotropies as functions of solar wind speed. We also show\ndistributions with solar wind speed of the total density, temperature,\ntemperature anisotropy and heat flux, as well as those of the proton\ntemperature, proton-to-electron temperature ratio, proton and electron beta.\nIntercorrelations between some of these parameters are also discussed.

Between the practical demonstration of X-ray interferometry\nat 1 keV by Cash et al.

Such a testbed cannot singularly focus on\nthe optical aspects, but should simultaneously address the thermal and\nmechanical stability of the interferometer. A particular challenge is the\ncoherent X-ray source, which should provide a wavefront at the entrance of the\ninterferometer that is transversely coherent over a distance at least equal to\nthe baseline, and bright enough. In this paper, we will explore the build-up of\na testbed in several stages, with increasing requirements on optical quality\nand associated thermo-mechanical control and source sophistication, with the\nintent to guide the technological development of X-ray interferometry from the\nlab to space in a sequence of achievable milestones.",

Traditional solution methods for these constraints require binary\nvariables and mixed-integer programming, which is prohibitively slow and\ncomputationally expensive. This paper targets a fast solution that is capable\nof real-time implementation onboard spacecraft. To do so, a novel algorithm is\ndeveloped that blends sequential convex programming and numerical continuation\ninto a single iterative solution process. Inside the algorithm, discrete logic\nconstraints are approximated by smooth functions, and a homotopy parameter\ngoverns the accuracy of this approximation. As the algorithm converges, the\nhomotopy parameter is updated such that the smooth approximations enforce the\nexact discrete logic. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically\ndemonstrated for a realistic rendezvous scenario inspired by the Apollo\nTransposition and Docking maneuver. In under 15 seconds of cumulative solver\ntime, the algorithm is able to reliably find difficult fuel-optimal\ntrajectories that obey the following discrete logic constraints: thruster\nminimum impulse-bit, range-triggered approach cone, and range-triggered plume\nimpingement. The optimized trajectory uses significantly less fuel than\nreported NASA design targets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  One of the key challenges in solar and heliospheric physics is to understand\nthe acceleration of the solar wind. As a super-sonic, super-Alfv\u00e9nic plasma\nflow, the solar wind carries mass, momentum, energy, and angular momentum from\nthe Sun into interplanetary space. We present a framework based on two-fluid\nmagnetohydrodynamics to estimate the flux of these quantities based on\nspacecraft data independent of the heliocentric distance of the location of\nmeasurement. Applying this method to the Ulysses dataset allows us to study the\ndependence of these fluxes on heliolatitude and solar cycle. The use of scaling\nlaws provides us with the heliolatitudinal dependence and the solar-cycle\ndependence of the scaled Alfv\u00e9nic and sonic Mach numbers as well as the\nAlfv\u00e9n and sonic critical radii. Moreover, we estimate the distance at which\nthe local thermal pressure and the local energy density in the magnetic field\nbalance. These results serve as predictions for observations with Parker Solar\nProbe, which currently explores the very inner heliosphere, and Solar Orbiter,\nwhich will measure the solar wind outside the plane of the ecliptic in the\ninner heliosphere during the course of the mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In non-collisional magnetized astrophysical plasmas, vortices can form as it\nis the case of the Venus plasma wake where Lundin et al. (2013) identified a\nlarge vortex through the integration of data of many orbits from the Venus\nExpress (VEX) spacecraft. On the one hand, our purpose is to develop a\ntheoretical foundation in order to explain the occurrence and formation of\nvortices in non-collisional astrophysical plasmas. On the other hand, to apply\nthe latter in order to study the vorticity in the wakes of Venus and Mars. We\nintroduce two theorems and two corollaries, which may be applicable to any\nnon-collisional plasma system, that relate the vorticity to electromagnetic\nvariables such as the magnetic field and the electric current density. We also\nintroduce a toy vortex model for the wakes of non-magnetized planetary bodies.\nFrom the proposed theorems and model and using magnetic data of the VEX and the\nMars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, we identify vortices in the wakes of\nVenus and Mars in single spacecraft wake crossings. We also identify a spatial\ncoincidence between current density and vorticity maxima confirming the\nconsistency of our theorems and model. We conclude that vortices in\nnon-collisional magnetized plasmas are always linked to electric currents and\nthat both vortices and currents always coexist. This suggests that the\nmechanism that produces this type of vortices is the mutual interaction between\nthe electric current and the magnetic field, that to a first approximation is\nexplained considering that plasma currents due to a non-zero net charge density\ninduce magnetic fields that modify the existing field and also produce a\nhelical field configuration that drives charged particles along helical\ntrajectories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory is currently conducting its\n4-year all-sky X-ray survey, started on December 12, 2019. The survey is\nperiodically interrupted for technological operations with the spacecraft.\nThese time intervals are usually used by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope\nto perform calibrations. In this context, SRG carried out scanning observations\nof the Puppis A supernova remnant (SNR) with the aim to check the imaging\nperformance of ART-XC and to optimize the technique of image reconstruction for\nextended objects. Using the unique imaging capabilities of ART-XC and its\nuniform coverage of the entire Puppis A region, we attempted to investigate the\nmorphology of this SNR at energies >4 keV, and to search for previously unknown\nX-ray sources. Puppis A was observed in 2019-2020, conducting 1.5 x 1.5 degrees\nshallow surveys with an exposure of 36 hours. Additional deep pointed\nobservations of the central part of Puppis A were carried out in 2021 lasted 31\nhours to highlight the morphology of the extended emission. The X-ray emission\nof the Puppis A was significantly detected as an extended structure in the 4-6\nkeV energy band. The morphology of the emission is in general agreement with\nthat observed in soft X-rays previously. The deep sky image of Puppis A\nobtained with the ART-XC telescope is characterized by a typical SNR shell rim\nmorphology, an extended emission and a bright emission knot in the\nnorth-eastern part of the supernova shell. Also, four point X-ray sources have\nbeen detected, including three objects identified in catalogs, and one newly\ndiscovered X-ray emitter.",
