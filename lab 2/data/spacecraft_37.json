    "abstract": "Abstract:  The amount of scientific data to be transmitted from deep-space probes is\nvery limited due to RF-communications constraints. Free-space optical\ncommunication can alleviate this bottleneck, increasing data rate while\nreducing weight, mass and power of communication onboard equipment.\nNevertheless, optimizing the power delivery from spacecraft to Earth is needed.\nIn RF communications, the strategy has been to increase the aperture of ground\nterminals. Free-space optical communications can also follow it, as they share\nthe limitation of low power received on Earth. As the cost of big telescopes\nincreases exponentially with aperture, new ideas are required to maximize the\naperture-to-cost ratio. This work explores the feasibility of using telescopes\nof the future Cherenkov Telescope Array as optical-communication ground\nstations. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has the same power limitation, hence\nCherenkov telescopes are designed to maximize receiver's aperture with minimum\ncost and some relaxed requirements. Both critical issues of the reutilization\nand possible adaptations of the telescopes to optimize them for communications,\nand telescopes simulations and numerical computations of several link budgets\napplied to worst-case scenarios are discussed, concluding that the proposal is\ntechnically feasible and would bring important cost reductions and performance\nimprovements compared to current designs for deepspace optical ground stations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by the MESSENGER (MES)\nand Venus Express (VEX) spacecraft have been catalogued and analysed. The ICMEs\nwere identified by a relatively smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction\nconsistent with a flux rope structure, coinciding with a relatively enhanced\nmagnetic field strength. A total of 35 ICMEs were found in the surveyed MES\ndata (primarily from March 2007 to April 2012), and 84 ICMEs in the surveyed\nVEX data (from May 2006 to December 2013). The ICME flux rope configurations\nhave been determined. Ropes with northward leading edges were about four times\nmore common than ropes with southward leading edges, in agreement with a\npreviously established solar cycle dependence. Ropes with low inclinations to\nthe solar equatorial plane were about four times more common than ropes with\nhigh inclinations, possibly an observational effect. Left and right-handed\nropes were observed in almost equal numbers. In addition, data from MES, VEX,\nSTEREO-A, STEREO-B and ACE were examined for multipoint signatures of the\ncatalogued ICMEs. For spacecraft separations below 15\u00b0 in heliocentric\nlongitude, the second spacecraft observed the ICME flux rope in 82% of cases;\nthis percentage dropped to 49% for separations between 15 and 30\u00b0, to 18%\nfor separations between 30 and 45\u00b0, and to 12% for separations between 45\nand 60\u00b0. As spacecraft separation increased, it became increasingly likely\nthat only the sheath and not the flux rope of the ICME was observed, in\nagreement with the notion that ICME flux ropes are smaller in longitudinal\nextent than the shocks or discontinuities that they often drive. Furthermore,\nthis study has identified 23 ICMEs observed by pairs of spacecraft close to\nradial alignment. A detailed analysis of these events could lead to a better\nunderstanding of how ICMEs evolve during propagation.",

Such functions, known as kappa or superthermal\ndistributions, have been found to provide a better fitting to the VDFs measured\nby spacecraft in the solar wind. One of the problems that is being addressed on\nthis new light is the temperature anisotropy of solar wind protons and\nelectrons. In the literature, the general treatment for waves excited by\n(bi-)Maxwellian plasmas is well-established. However, for kappa distributions,\nthe wave characteristics have been studied mostly for the limiting cases of\npurely parallel or perpendicular propagation, relative to the ambient magnetic\nfield. Contributions to the general case of obliquely-propagating\nelectromagnetic waves have been scarcely reported so far. The absence of a\ngeneral treatment prevents a complete analysis of the wave-particle interaction\nin kappa plasmas, since some instabilities can operate simultaneously both in\nthe parallel and oblique directions. In a recent work, Gaelzer and Ziebell [J.\nGeophys. Res. 119, 9334 (2014)] obtained expressions for the dielectric tensor\nand dispersion relations for the low-frequency, quasi-perpendicular dispersive\nAlfv\u00e9n waves resulting from a kappa VDF. In the present work, the formalism\nintroduced by Ref. 1 is generalized for the general case of electrostatic\nand/or electromagnetic waves propagating in a kappa plasma in any frequency\nrange and for arbitrary angles. An isotropic distribution is considered, but\nthe methods used here can be easily applied to more general anisotropic\ndistributions, such as the bi-kappa or product-bi-kappa.",

We focus especially on space radiation and its impact on space\nexploration. The topic is highly interdisciplinary bringing together\nfundamental concepts of nuclear physics with aspects of radiation protection\nand space science. We present a new approach to presenting the topic by\ndeveloping a web-based tool that combines some of the fundamental concepts from\nthese two fields in a single tool that can be developed in the context of\nadvanced secondary or undergraduate university education. We present DREADCode,\nan outreach or teaching tool to asses rapidly the current conditions of the\nradiation field in space. DREADCode uses the available data feeds from a number\nof ongoing space missions to produce a first order approximation of the dose an\nastronaut would receive during a mission of exploration in deep space.\nDREADcode is based on a intuitive GUI interface available online from the\nEuropean Space Weather Portal. The core of the radiation transport computation\nto produce the radiation dose from the observed fluence of radiation observed\nby the spacecraft fleet considered is based on a relatively simple\napproximation: the Bethe-Block equation. DREADCode assumes also a simplified\ngeometry and material configuration for the shields used to compute the dose.\nThe approach is approximate and it sacrifices some important physics on the\naltar of a rapid execution time allowing a real time operation scenario. There\nis no intention here to produce an operational tool for use in the space\nscience and engineering. Rather we present an educational tool at undergraduate\nlevel that uses modern web-based and programming methods to learn some of the\nmost important concepts in the application of radiation protection to space\nweather problems.",

For Jupiter, we also fit the modeled light curves to the observed\nfull-disk brightness. We derive spherical albedos for Jupiter, Saturn, and for\nplanets with Lambertian and Rayleigh-scattering atmospheres. Jupiter-like\natmospheres can produce light curves that are a factor of two fainter at\nhalf-phase than the Lambertian planet, given the same geometric albedo at\ntransit. The spherical albedo is typically lower than for a Lambertian planet\nby up to a factor of 1.5. The Lambertian assumption will underestimate the\nabsorption of the stellar light and the equilibrium temperature of the\nplanetary atmosphere.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Collisionless shocks are efficient particle accelerators. At Earth, ions with\nenergies exceeding 100 keV are seen upstream of the bow shock when the magnetic\ngeometry is quasi-parallel, and large-scale supernova remnant shocks can\naccelerate ions into cosmic rays energies. This energization is attributed to\ndiffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become active the\nions must first be sufficiently energized. How and where this initial\nacceleration takes place has been one of the key unresolved issues in shock\nacceleration theory. Using Cluster spacecraft observations, we study the\nsignatures of ion reflection events in the turbulent transition layer upstream\nof the terrestrial bow shock, and with the support of a hybrid simulation of\nthe shock, we show that these reflection signatures are characteristic of the\nfirst step in the ion injection process. These reflection events develop in\nparticular in the region where the trailing edge of large-amplitude upstream\nwaves intercept the local shock ramp and the upstream magnetic field changes\nfrom quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel. The dispersed ion velocity\nsignature observed can be attributed to a rapid succession of ion reflections\nat this wave boundary. After the ions' initial interaction with the shock, they\nflow upstream along the quasi-parallel magnetic field. Each subsequent wave\nfront in the upstream region will sweep the ions back toward the shock, where\nthey gain energy with each transition between the upstream and the shock wave\nframes. Within three to five gyroperiods, some ions have gained enough parallel\nvelocity to escape upstream, thus completing the injection process.",

The resulting turbulent\nregimes are characterized by the nonlinearity parameter, defined as the ratio\nof the characteristic times of Alfv\u00e9n wave propagation and of the transverse\nnonlinear dynamics. The corresponding transverse magnetic energy spectra\ndisplay power laws with exponents spanning a range of values consistent with\nspacecraft observations. The meandering of the magnetic field lines together\nwith the ion temperature homogenization along these lines are shown to be\nrelated to the strength of the turbulence, measured by the nonlinearity\nparameter. The results are interpreted in terms of a recently proposed\nphenomenological model where the homogenization process along field lines\ninduced by Landau damping plays a central role.",

The MPC is based on a\nplanner that employs a PAM or impulsive approximation as a hot-start and then\nuses explicit linearization around successive PWM solutions for rapidly\nimproving the solution by means of linear programming. As an example, the\nproblem of rendezvous of spacecraft for eccentric target orbits is considered.\nThe problem is modeled by the LTV Tschauner-Hempel equations, whose transition\nmatrix is explicit; this is exploited by the algorithm for rapid convergence.\nThe efficacy of the method is shown in a simulation study.",

Using\nimages acquired by the Chang'e-2 spacecraft, more than 200 boulders have been\nidentified over the imaged area of the near-Earth asteroid Toutatis. The\ncumulative boulder size frequency distribution (SFD) shows a steep slope of\n-4.4 $\\pm$ 0.1, which is indicative of a high degree of fragmentation. Similar\nto Itokawa, Toutatis probably has a rubble-pile structure, as most boulders on\nits surface cannot solely be explained by impact cratering. The significantly\nsteeper slope for Toutatis' boulder SFD compared to Itokawa may imply a\ndifferent preservation state or diverse formation scenarios. In addition, the\ncumulative crater SFD has been used to estimate a surface crater retention age\nof approximately 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.3 Gyr.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar wind electric sail (E-sail) is a planned in-space propulsion device\nthat uses the natural solar wind momentum flux for spacecraft propulsion with\nthe help of long, charged, centrifugally stretched tethers. The problem of\naccurately predicting the E-sail thrust is still somewhat open, however, due to\na possible electron population trapped by the tether. Here we develop a new\ntype of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation for predicting E-sail thrust. In the\nnew simulation, electrons are modelled as a fluid, hence resembling hydrid\nsimulation, but in contrast to normal hybrid simulation, the Poisson equation\nis used as in normal PIC to calculate the self-consistent electrostatic field.\nFor electron-repulsive parts of the potential, the Boltzmann relation is used.\nFor electron-attractive parts of the potential we employ a power law which\ncontains a parameter that can be used to control the number of trapped\nelectrons. We perform a set of runs varying the parameter and select the one\nwith the smallest number of trapped electrons which still behaves in a\nphysically meaningful way in the sense of producing not more than one solar\nwind ion deflection shock upstream of the tether. By this prescription we\nobtain thrust per tether length values that are in line with earlier estimates,\nalthough somewhat smaller. We conclude that the Boltzmann PIC simulation is a\nnew tool for simulating the E-sail thrust. This tool enables us to calculate\nsolutions rapidly and allows to easily study different scenarios for trapped\nelectrons.",

Because of Kepler's large, undersampled pixels and the\npresence of nearby sources, aperture photometry is not always the ideal way to\nobtain high-precision photometry and, because of this, the data set has not\nbeen fully exploited so far. We present a new method that builds on our\nexperience with undersampled HST images. The method involves a point-spread\nfunction (PSF) neighbour-subtraction and was specifically developed to exploit\nthe huge potential offered by the K2 \"super-stamps\" covering the core of dense\nstar clusters. Our test-bed targets were the NGC 2158 and M 35 regions observed\nduring the K2 Campaign 0. We present our PSF modeling and demonstrate that, by\nusing a high-angular-resolution input star list from the Asiago Schmidt\ntelescope as the basis for PSF neighbour subtraction, we are able to reach\nmagnitudes as faint as Kp~24 with a photometric precision of 10% over 6.5\nhours, even in the densest regions. At the bright end, our photometric\nprecision reaches ~30 parts-per-million. Our method leads to a considerable\nlevel of improvement at the faint magnitudes (Kp>15.5) with respect to the\nclassical aperture photometry. This improvement is more significant in crowded\nregions. We also extracted raw light curves of ~60,000 stars and detrended them\nfor systematic effects induced by spacecraft motion and other artifacts that\nharms K2 photometric precision. We present a list of 2133 variables.",

Most of them are members of the Vesta dynamical\nfamily, but an increasingly large number appear to have no link with it. The\nquestion that arises is whether all these basaltic objects do indeed come from\nVesta. To find the answer to the above questioning, we decided to perform a\nstatistical analysis of the spectroscopic and mineralogical properties of a\nlarge sample of V-types, with the objective to highlight similarities and\ndifferences among them, and shed light on their unique, or not, origin. The\nanalysis was performed using 190 visible and near-infrared spectra from the\nliterature for 117 V-type asteroids. The asteroids were grouped according to\ntheir dynamical properties and their computed spectral parameters compared.\nComparison was also performed with spectral parameters of a sample of HED\nmeteorites and data of the surface of Vesta taken by the VIR instrument on\nboard of the Dawn spacecraft. Our analysis shows that although most of the\nV-type asteroids in the inner main belt do have a surface composition\ncompatible with an origin from Vesta, this seem not to be the case for V-types\nin the middle and outer main belt.",

Pluto's\natmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer,\nand a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto's diverse surface geology and\nlong-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain\nactive many billions of years after formation. Pluto's large moon Charon\ndisplays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition, its\nnorth pole displays puzzling dark terrain.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Hera Saturn entry probe mission is proposed as an M--class mission led by\nESA with a contribution from NASA. It consists of one atmospheric probe to be\nsent into the atmosphere of Saturn, and a Carrier-Relay spacecraft. In this\nconcept, the Hera probe is composed of ESA and NASA elements, and the\nCarrier-Relay Spacecraft is delivered by ESA. The probe is powered by\nbatteries, and the Carrier-Relay Spacecraft is powered by solar panels and\nbatteries. We anticipate two major subsystems to be supplied by the United\nStates, either by direct procurement by ESA or by contribution from NASA: the\nsolar electric power system (including solar arrays and the power management\nand distribution system), and the probe entry system (including the thermal\nprotection shield and aeroshell). Hera is designed to perform in situ\nmeasurements of the chemical and isotopic compositions as well as the dynamics\nof Saturn's atmosphere using a single probe, with the goal of improving our\nunderstanding of the origin, formation, and evolution of Saturn, the giant\nplanets and their satellite systems, with extrapolation to extrasolar planets.\nHera's aim is to probe well into the cloud-forming region of the troposphere,\nbelow the region accessible to remote sensing, to the locations where certain\ncosmogenically abundant species are expected to be well mixed. By leading to an\nimproved understanding of the processes by which giant planets formed,\nincluding the composition and properties of the local solar nebula at the time\nand location of giant planet formation, Hera will extend the legacy of the\nGalileo and Cassini missions by further addressing the creation, formation, and\nchemical, dynamical, and thermal evolution of the giant planets, the entire\nsolar system including Earth and the other terrestrial planets, and formation\nof other planetary systems.",

The flare was\nobserved in spectral lines of O VI, Fe X, Fe XII, Fe XIV, Fe XV, Fe XVI, Fe\nXVII, Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV. The EIS observations were made coincident with hard\nX-ray bursts observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). Overlays of the RHESSI images on the EIS raster images at\ndifferent wavelengths show a spatial coincidence of features in the RHESSI\nimages with the EIS upflow and downflow regions, as well as loop-top or\nnear-loop-top regions. A complex array of phenomena was observed including\nmultiple evaporation regions and the surge, which was also observed by the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) telescopes.\nThe slit of the EIS spectrometer covered several flare footpoint regions from\nwhich evaporative upflows in Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV lines were observed with\nDoppler speeds greater than 500 km s$^{-1}$. For ions such as Fe XV both\nevaporative outflows (~200 km s$^{-1}$) and downflows (~30-50 km s$^{-1}$) were\nobserved. Non-thermal motions from 120 to 300 km s$^{-1}$ were measured in\nflare lines. In the surge, Doppler speeds are found from about 0 to over 250 km\ns$^{-1}$ in lines from ions such as Fe XIV. The non-thermal motions could be\ndue to multiple sources slightly Doppler-shifted from each other or turbulence\nin the evaporating plasma. We estimate the energetics of the hard X-ray burst\nand obtain a total flare energy in accelerated electrons of\n$\\geq7\\times10^{28}$ ergs. This is a lower limit because only an upper limit\ncan be determined for the low energy cutoff to the electron spectrum.

These particles have been\nstudied using a number of techniques ranging from in-situ satellite detectors\nto analysis of lunar microcraters to ground-based observations of zodiacal\nlight. In this paper, we describe an approach for using the LISA Pathfinder\n(LPF) mission as an instrument to detect and characterize the dynamics of dust\nparticles in the vicinity of Earth-Sun L1. Launching in late 2015, LPF is a\ndedicated technology demonstrator mission that will validate several key\ntechnologies for a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory. The\nprimary science instrument aboard LPF is a precision accelerometer which we\nshow will be capable of sensing discrete momentum impulses as small as $4\\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\textrm{N}\\cdot\\textrm{s}$. We then estimate the rate of such impulses\nresulting from impacts of micrometeoroids based on standard models of the\nmicrometeoroid environment in the inner solar system. We find that LPF may\ndetect dozens to hundreds of individual events corresponding to impacts of\nparticles with masses $> 10^{-9}\\,$g during LPF's roughly six-month science\noperations phase in a $5\\times 10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ by $8\\times\n10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ Lissajous orbit around L1. In addition, we estimate the\nability of LPF to characterize individual impacts by measuring quantities such\nas total momentum transferred, direction of impact, and location of impact on\nthe spacecraft. Information on flux and direction provided by LPF may provide\ninsight as to the nature and origin of the individual impact and help constrain\nmodels of the interplanetary dust complex in general. Additionally, this direct\nin-situ measurement of micrometeoroid impacts will be valuable to designers of\nfuture spacecraft targeting the environment around L1.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In the early 1990s, contemporary interstellar dust (ISD) penetrating deep\ninto the heliosphere was identified with the in-situ dust detector on board the\nUlysses spacecraft. Between 1992 and the end of 2007 Ulysses monitored the ISD\nstream. The interstellar grains act as tracers of the physical conditions in\nthe local interstellar medium surrounding our solar system. Earlier analyses of\nthe Ulysses ISD data measured between 1992 and 1998 implied the existence of\n'big' ISD grains [up to 10^-13kg]. The derived gas-to-dust-mass ratio was\nsmaller than the one derived from astronomical observations, implying a\nconcentration of ISD in the very local interstellar medium. We analyse the\nentire data set from 16 yr of Ulysses ISD measurements in interplanetary space.\nThis paper concentrates on the overall mass distribution of ISD. An\naccompanying paper investigates time-variable phenomena in the Ulysses ISD\ndata, and in a third paper we present the results from dynamical modelling of\nthe ISD flow applied to Ulysses. We use the latest values for the interstellar\nhydrogen and helium densities, the interstellar helium flow speed of\nv_ISM,inf=23.2km/s, and the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity, beta,\ncalculated for astronomical silicates. We find a gas-to-dust-mass ratio in the\nlocal interstellar cloud of R_g/d=193^+85_-57, and a dust density of\n2.1+/-0.6x10^-24kg/m^3. For a higher inflow speed of 26km/s, the\ngas-to-dust-mass ratio is 20% higher, and, accordingly, the dust density is\nlower by the same amount. The gas-to-dust mass ratio derived from our new\nanalysis is compatible with the value most recently determined from\nastronomical observations. We confirm earlier results that the very local\ninterstellar medium contains 'big' (i.e. 1 um-sized) ISD grains. We find a dust\ndensity in the local interstellar medium that is a factor of three lower than\nvalues implied by earlier analyses.",

The estimated travel time of the disturbance ($\\sim 20$ hrs), together\nwith the massive magnetic field strengths measured within the ejecta ($>\n100$nT), made it one of the most extreme events observed during the space era.\nIn this study, we examine the properties of the shock wave. Because of an\ninstrument malfunction, plasma measurements during the interval surrounding the\nCME were limited, and our approach has been modified to capitalize on the\navailable measurements and suitable proxies, where possible. We were able to\ninfer the following properties. First, the shock normal was pointing\npredominantly in the radial direction (${\\bf n} = 0.97 {\\bf e}_r -0.09 {\\bf\ne}_t -0.23 {\\bf e}_n$). Second, the angle between ${\\bf n}$ and the upstream\nmagnetic field, $\\theta_{Bn}$, was estimated to be $\\approx 34^{\\circ}$, making\nthe shock \"quasi-parallel,\" and supporting the idea of an earlier\n\"preconditioning\" ICME. Third, the shock speed was estimated to be $\\approx\n3300$ km s$^{-1}$. Fourth, the sonic Mach number, $M_s$, for this shock was\n$\\sim 28$. We support these results with an idealized numerical simulation of\nthe ICME. Finally, we estimated the change in ram pressure upstream of the\nshock to be $\\sim 5$ times larger than the pressure from the energetic\nparticles, suggesting that this was not a standard \"steady-state\" cosmic-ray\nmodified shock (CRMS). Instead it might represent an early, transient phase in\nthe evolution of the CRMS.",

Motivated by these results, we\nbriefly consider the feasibility of a survey to search for and characterize\ncold exoplanets analogous to Jupiter and Saturn using a target-of-opportunity\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We employ remote observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the\nassociated solar flares to forecast the CME-related Forbush decreases, i.e.,\nshort-term depressions in the galactic cosmic-ray flux. The relationship\nbetween the Forbush effect at the Earth and remote observations of CMEs and\nassociated solar flares is studied via a statistical analysis. Relationships\nbetween Forbush decrease magnitude and several CME/flare parameters was found,\nnamely the initial CME speed, apparent width, source position, associated\nsolar-flare class and the effect of successive-CME occurrence. Based on the\nstatistical analysis, remote solar observations are employed for a\nForbush-decrease forecast. For that purpose, an empirical probabilistic model\nis constructed that uses selected remote solar observations of CME and\nassociated solar flare as an input, and gives expected Forbush-decrease\nmagnitude range as an output. The forecast method is evaluated using several\nverification measures, indicating that as the forecast tends to be more\nspecific it is less reliable, which is its main drawback. However, the\nadvantages of the method are that it provides early prediction, and that the\ninput is not necessarily spacecraft-dependent.",

We describe an arm-locking controller design for the\nGRACE-FO system and a series of time-domain simulations that demonstrate its\nfeasibility.

We further demonstrate\nthat `pulling' of the master laser frequency due to fluctuating Doppler shifts\nand lock acquisition transients is less than $100\\,$MHz over several GRACE-FO\norbits.

Our study\nimplies that the MFR system in the AR is initiated to upward motion by\nkink-instability and further driven by torus-instability. The CME morphology,\ncaptured in simultaneous three-point coronagraph observations, is fitted with\nGraduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model and discerns an MFR topology with\norientation aligning with magnetic neutral line in the source AR. This MFR\nexpands self-similarly and is found to have source AR twist signatures in the\nassociated near Earth magnetic cloud (MC). We further derived kinematics of\nthis CME propagation by employing a plethora of stereoscopic as well as single\nspacecraft reconstruction techniques. While stereoscopic methods perform\nrelatively poorly compared to other methods, fitting methods worked best in\nestimating the arrival time of the CME compared to in-situ measurements.\nSupplied with values of constrained solar wind velocity, drag parameter and 3D\nkinematics from GCS fit, we construct CME kinematics from the drag based model\nconsistent with in-situ MC arrival.",

A combined analysis of the\ngalactic rotation curves and Solar System constraints (provided by the Cassini\nspacecraft) rules out several classes of popular MOND transition functions, but\nleaves others viable.

More than 5000 images and 170 occultations of the A\nring outer edge are analyzed. Our fits confirm the expected response to the\nJanus 7:6 Inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) between 2006 and 2010, when Janus was\non the inner leg of its regular orbit swap with Epimetheus. During this period,\nthe edge exhibits a regular 7-lobed pattern with an amplitude of 12.8 km and\none minimum aligned with the orbital longitude of Janus, as has been found by\nprevious investigators. However, between 2010 and 2014, the Janus/Epimetheus\norbit swap moves the Janus 7:6 LR away from the A ring outer edge, and the\n7-lobed pattern disappears. In addition to several smaller-amplitudes modes,\nindeed, we found a variety of pattern speeds with different azimuthal wave\nnumbers, and many of them may arise from resonant cavities between the ILR and\nthe ring edge; also we found some other signatures consistent with tesseral\nresonances that could be associated with inhomogeneities in Saturn's gravity\nfield. Moreover, these signatures do not have a fixed pattern speed. We present\nan analysis of these data and suggest a possible dynamical model for the\nbehavior of the A ring's outer edge after 2010.",

The Dawn spacecraft began orbital science\noperations at the dwarf planet in April 2015. We observed Ceres with flight\nspares of the seven Dawn Framing Camera color filters mounted on ground-based\ntelescopes over the course of three years to model its phase function versus\nwavelength. Our analysis shows that the modeled geometric albedos derived from\nboth the IAU HG model and the Hapke model are consistent with a flat and\nfeatureless spectrum of Ceres, although the values are ~10% higher than\nprevious measurements. Our models also suggest a wavelength dependence of\nCeres' phase function. The IAU G-parameter and the Hapke single-particle phase\nfunction parameter, g, are both consistent with decreasing (shallower) phase\nslope with increasing wavelength. Such a wavelength dependence of phase\nfunction is consistent with reddening of spectral slope with increasing phase\nangle, or phase-reddening. This phase reddening is consistent with previous\nspectra of Ceres obtained at various phase angles archived in the literature,\nand consistent with the fact that the modeled geometric albedo spectrum of\nCeres is the bluest of all spectra because it represents the spectrum at 0\ndegree phase angle. Ground-based FC color filter lightcurve data are consistent\nwith HST albedo maps confirming that Ceres' lightcurve is dominated by albedo\nand not shape. We detected a positive correlation between 1.1-micron absorption\nband depth and geometric albedo suggesting brighter areas on Ceres have\nabsorption bands that are deeper.",

The model helps to understand and identify the origin of individual\ncomponents that collectively contribute to the energy-dependent spectral\nresponse of the SCD. Furthermore, the model provides completeness to various\ncalibration tasks, such as generating spectral response matrices (RMFs -\nredistribution matrix files), estimating efficiency, optimizing event selection\nlogic, and maximizing event recovery to improve photon-collection efficiency in\nSCDs.\nWe compare simulation results of the SCD CCD54 with measurements obtained\nduring the ground calibration of C1XS and clearly demonstrate that our model\nreproduces all the major spectral features seen in calibration data. We also\ndescribe our understanding of interactions at different layers of SCD that\ncontribute to the observed spectrum.
