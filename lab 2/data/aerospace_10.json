The\nmeasurement of this deviation itself gives insight into the underlying\nstructure of the spacetime geometry, which is curved and therefore described by\nthe theory of general relativity (GR). In the context of GR, the deviation of\nnearby geodesics can be described by the Jacobi equation that is a result of\nlinearizing the geodesic equation around a known reference geodesic with\nrespect to the deviation vector and the relative velocity. We review the\nderivation of this Jacobi equation and restrict ourselves to the simple case of\nthe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution and circular\nreference geodesics to find solutions by projecting the Jacobi equation on a\nparallel propagated tetrad as done by Fuchs. Using his results, we construct\nsolutions of the Jacobi equation for different physical initial scenarios\ninspired by satellite gravimetry missions and give a set of parameter together\nwith their precise impact on satellite orbit deviation. We further consider the\nNewtonian analog and construct the full solution, that exhibits a similar\nstructure, within this theory.",

The\nenabling technology providing the advanced solar SXR spectral measurements is\nthe Amptek X123, a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) silicon drift detector\n(SDD). The Amptek X123 has a low mass (~324 g after modification), modest power\nconsumption (~2.50 W), and small volume (6.86 cm x 9.91 cm x 2.54 cm), making\nit ideal for a CubeSat.

New types of materials\ndedicated for space applications, that have been developed in the last decade,\nare in majority not well tested for different space mission scenarios. Very\nlittle is known how material degradation may affect the stability and\nfunctionality of space vehicles and devices during long term space missions.\nOur aim is to predict how the solar wind and electromagnetic radiation degrade\nmetallic structures. Therefore both experimental and theoretical studies of\nmaterial degradation under space conditions have been performed.

The paper presents the results of the\ntheoretical part of those studies.

A\nthermodynamic model of bubble formation has been developed. We study the\ncreation process of $\\rm{H_2}$-bubbles as function of, inter alia, the metal\ntemperature, proton dose and energy. Our model has been verified by irradiation\nexperiments completed at the DLR facility in Bremen. Consequences of the bubble\nformation are changes of the physical and thermo-optical properties of such\ndegraded metals. We show that a high surface density of bubbles (up to $10^8$\n$\\rm{cm^{-2}}$) with a typical bubble diameter of $\\sim 0.4$$\\rm{\\mu}$m will\ncause a significant increase of the metallic surface roughness.

First, a quadratic programming problem\nis formulated to design beam patterns by using the criteria for a minimal\nintegrated side-lobe level. A theorem is derived that provides a closed-form\nanalytical optimal solution that appears to be an extension of the Rayleigh\nquotient minimization for a possibly singular matrix in quadratic form. Such\nsingularities are shown to occur in the problem of interest, but proofs for the\noptimum solution in these singular matrix cases could not be found in the\nliterature. Next, an additional constraint is added to obtain beam patterns\nwith desired 3 dB beamwidths, resulting in a nonconvex quadratically\nconstrained quadratic program which is NP-hard. A semidefinite program and a\nGaussian randomized semidefinite relaxation are used to determine feasible\nsolutions arbitrarily close to the solution to the original problem.\nTheoretical and numerical analyses illustrate the impacts of changing the\nnumber of transmitters and orthogonal waveforms employed in the designs.\nNumerical comparisons are conducted to evaluate the proposed design approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This study presents a real-time guidance strategy for an unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing\n{\\sl insitu} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these\nstrategies, periodic adjustments are made in the airspeed and/or heading angle\ncommand, in level flights, for the UAV to minimize a projected power\nrequirement. In this study, UAV dynamics are described by a three-dimensional\ndynamic point-mass model. A stochastic wind field model has been used to\nanalyze the effect of the wind in the process. Onboard closed-loop trajectory\ntracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the\nmethod of feedback linearization. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies\nin enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which\nthe UAV would follow the optimal airspeed command in a steady level flight\nunder zero wind conditions. A performance measure is defined as the average\npower consumption with respect to no wind case. Different scenarios have been\nevaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial\nheading angles of the UAV. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the\npercentage improvement in the performance measure of a proposed strategy over\nthat of the reference strategy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted\nto show efficiency and applicability of the proposed algorithms. Results\ndemonstrate possible power savings of the proposed real-time guidance\nstrategies in level flights, by utilization of wind energy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In order to avoid collisions with space debris, the near Earth orbit must be\ncontinuously scanned by either ground- or spaced-based facilities. For the low\nEarth orbit, radar telescopes are the workhorse for this task, especially due\nto their continuous availability. However, optical observation methods can\ndeliver complementary information, especially towards high accuracy\nmeasurements. Passive-optical observations are inexpensive and can yield very\nprecise information about the apparent position of the object in the sky via\ncomparison with background stars. However, the object's distance from the\nobserver is not readily accessible, which constitutes a major drawback of this\napproach for the precise calculation of the orbital elements. Two experimental\nmethods have been devised to overcome this problem: Using two observatories a\nfew kilometres apart, strictly simultaneous observations of the same object\nyield an accurate, instantaneous 3D position determination through measurement\nof the parallax. If only one observatory is available, a pulsed laser can be\nused in addition to the passive-optical channel to measure the distance to the\nobject, in a similar fashion as used by the satellite laser ranging community.\nHowever, compared to conventional laser ranging, a stronger laser and more\nelaborate tracking algorithms are necessary. The two approaches can also be\ncombined by illuminating the object with a pulsed laser from one observatory\nand measuring the return times at both observatories. These techniques are\nexplored by German Aerospace Center in Stuttgart using its orbital debris\nresearch observatory, in cooperation with the Satellite Laser Ranging station\nin Graz and the Geodetic Observatory in Wettzell. This contribution will\npresent some of the results and plans for further measurement campaigns.",

The baryonic component of the universe during this period is\nalmost entirely neutral hydrogen, which falls into local regions of higher dark\nmatter density. This seeds the formation of large-scale structures including\nthe cosmic web that we see today in the filamentary distribution of galaxies\nand clusters of galaxies. The only detectable signal from these dark ages is\nthe 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen, redshifted down to frequencies of\napproximately 10-100 MHz. Space-based observations of this signal will allow us\nto determine the formation epoch and physics of the first sources of ionizing\nradiation, and potentially detect evidence for the decay of dark matter\nparticles. JPL is developing deployable low frequency antenna and receiver\nprototypes to enable both all-sky spectral measurements of neutral hydrogen and\nultimately to map the spatial distribution of the signal as a function of\nredshift. Such observations must be done from space because of Earth's\nionosphere and ubiquitous radio interference. A specific application of these\ntechnologies is the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission. This small\nExplorer class mission is designed to measure the sky-averaged hydrogen signal\nfrom the shielded region above the far side of the Moon. These data will\ncomplement ground-based radio observations of the final stages of intergalactic\nre-ionization at higher frequencies. DARE will also serve as a scientific\npercursor for space-based interferometry missions to image the distribution of\nhydrogen during the cosmic dark ages.",

This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy\nshot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR)\nelectromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate\nfor future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile\n(several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While\nthe primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of\ntargets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter\nairplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large\ninitial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this\nstudy we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation\ndelivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a\ncontemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun\noutperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first\ndraft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path\nof the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and\nthe aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed\nwithin the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the\nfeasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of\nthe limits of the technology. It is envisioned that this baseline design can be\nused as a helpful starting point for discussions of a possible electrical\nweaponization of future European warships.",

Based\non the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a\nmatrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as\nMUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with\ncompressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive\nnode forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this\npaper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the\ndata matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based\non knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)\ntechniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new\nMIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either\nperforms matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary\nwaveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random\nsampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the\nreceived samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center\npartially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to\nestimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of the recently\nproposed MIMO-CS radars, i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data,\nbut unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar\nconcept is illustrated through a linear uniform array configuration, and its\ntarget estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Common ISAR radar images and signals can be reconstructed from much fewer\nsamples than the sampling theorem requires since they are usually sparse.\nUnavailable randomly positioned samples can result from heavily corrupted parts\nof the signal. Since these samples can be omitted and declared as unavailable,\nthe application of the compressive sensing methods in the recovery of heavily\ncorrupted signal and radar images is possible. A\\ simple direct method for the\nrecovery of unavailable signal samples and the calculation of the restored ISAR\nimage is reviewed. An analysis of the noise influence is performed. For fast\nmaneuvering ISAR targets the sparsity property is lost since the ISAR image is\nblurred. A nonparametric quadratic time-frequency representations based method\nis used to restore the ISAR image sparsity. However, the linear relation\nbetween the signal and the sparsity domain transformation is lost. A recently\nproposed gradient recovery algorithm is adapted for this kind of analysis. It\ndoes not require the linear relation of the signal and its sparsity domain\ntransformation in the process of unavailable data recovery. The presented\nmethods and results are tested on several numerical examples proving the\nexpected accuracy and improvements.",

Metal\nstructures, while used in space, are subjected to the full spectrum of the\nelectromagnetic radiation together with particle irradiation. Hence, they\nundergo degradation. Future space missions are planned to proceed in the\ninterplanetary space, where the protons of the solar wind play a very\ndestructive role on metallic surfaces. Unfortunately, their real degradation\nbehavior is to a great extent unknown.\nOur aim is to predict materials' behavior in such a destructive environment.\nTherefore both, theoretical and experimental studies are performed at the\nGerman Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen, Germany.\nHere, we report the theoretical results of those studies. We examine the\nprocess of H2-bubble formation on metallic surfaces. H2-bubbles are metal caps\nfilled with Hydrogen molecular gas resulting from recombination processes of\nthe metal free electrons and the solar protons. A thermodynamic model of the\nbubble growth is presented. Our model predicts e.g. the velocity of that growth\nand the reflectivity of foils populated by bubbles.\nFormation of bubbles irreversibly changes the surface quality of irradiated\nmetals. Thin metallic films are especially sensitive for such degradation\nprocesses. They are used e.g. in the solar sail propulsion technology. The\nefficiency of that technology depends on the thermo-optical properties of the\nsail materials. Therefore, bubble formation processes have to be taken into\naccount for the planning of long-term solar sail missions.",

The\ncorresponding delay in having cooperative (relay-based) communications with\nrelay selection is also addressed.

These features are purposely\nexploited in different contexts ranging from natural products\nextraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. Large part of studies\nconcerns this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at\nhigh Mach number where compressibility and thermodynamics strictly interact.\nDespite the widespread use also at low Mach number, the turbulent mixing\nproperties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in\ndetail in this regime. This topic is addressed here by dealing with Direct\nNumerical Simulations (DNS) of a coaxial jet of a slightly supercritical Van\nder Waals fluid. Since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the Low Mach number\nconditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based\non a suitable low-Mach number expansion of the governing equation. According to\nexperimental observations, the weakly supercritical regime is characterized by\nthe formation of finger-like structures-- the so-called ligaments --in the\nshear layers separating the two streams. The mechanism of ligament formation at\nvanishing Mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed\nstatistical characterization is provided. Ligaments always form whenever a high\ndensity contrast occurs, independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. The\ndifference between real and perfect gas conditions is found in the ligament\nsmall-scale structure. More intense density gradients and thinner interfaces\ncharacterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior\nof the perfect gas. A phenomenological interpretation is here provided on the\nbasis of the real gas thermodynamics properties.",

Considering the characteristics of coupled\nlibrational and orbital motions, an averaging method is introduced to deal with\nthe slow-fast system equation, thus a definite equivalent model is derived. The\ngeneral orbit motion is completely determined analytically, including the orbit\ngeometry, periodicity, conversations and moving region etc. Since the\npossibility of orbit control using tether reaction has been proved by previous\nstudies, special attention is paid to the transportation mode of angular\nmomentum and mechanical energy between the orbit and libration. The effect of\ntether length change on the orbit shape is verified both in the averaged model\nand original model. The results show the orbit angular momentum and mechanical\nenergy can be controlled independently, and the operating principles of tether\nreactions are derived for special modification of orbit shape.",

This includes mechanism of the large coherent vortex\nstructure formation, small length scale generation and flow randomization. The\nwidely spread concept vortex breakdown to turbulence,which was considered as\nthe last stage of flow transition, is not observed and is found theoretically\nincorrect. The classical theory on boundary layer transition is challenged and\nwe proposed a new theory with five steps, i.e. receptivity, linear instability,\nlarge vortex formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and\nrandomization to turbulence. We have also proposed a new theory about\nturbulence generation. The new theory shows that all small length scales\n(turbulence) are generated by shear layer instability which is produced by\nlarge vortex structure with multiple level vortex rings, multiple level sweeps\nand ejections, and multiple level negative and positive spikes near the laminar\nsub-layers.Therefore, turbulence is not generated by vortex breakdown but\nrather positive and negative spikes and consequent high shear layers. Shear\nlayer instability is considered as the mother of turbulence. This new theory\nmay give a universal mechanism for turbulence generation and sustenance which\nshows that the energy is brought by large vortex structure through multiple\nlevel sweeps.",

The flow randomization is a crucial phase before flow\ntransition to the turbulent state. According to existing literatures, the\nrandomization was caused by the big background noises and non-periodic spanwise\nboundary conditions. It was assumed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first, and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scales quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, by careful analysis of our high order DNS\nresults, we believe that the internal instability of multiple ring cycles\nstructure is the main reason. What we observed is that randomization begins\nwhen the third cycle overlaps the first and second cycles. A significant\nasymmetric phenomenon is originated from the second cycle in the middle of both\nstreamwise and spanwise directions. More technically, a visible asymmetric\nphenomenon in the middle vortex ring cycle starts at time step t=16.25T and\nx=838.9{\\delta}in where the top and bottom level rings are still completely\nsymmetric. The non-symmetric structure of middle level ring affects the small\nlength scale in boundary layer bottom quickly. The randomization phenomenon\nspreads to top level through ejections. Finally, the whole flow domain becomes\nrandomized. A hypothesis of C- and K-types shift is given as a possible\nmechanism of flow randomization.",

It was widely accepted that small length\nvortices were generated by large vortex breakdown. According to our recent DNS,\nwe find that the hairpin vortex structure is very stable and never breaks down\nto small pieces. On the other hand, we recognize that there are strong positive\nspikes besides the ring neck in the spanwise direction. The strongly positive\nspikes are caused by second sweeps which are generated by perfectly circular\nand perpendicularly standing vortex rings. The second sweep brings energy from\nthe invisid region downdraft to the bottom of the boundary layers, which\ngenerates high shear layers around the positive spikes.Since the high shear\nlayer is not stable, all small length scales (turbulence) are generated around\nhigh shear layers especially near the wall surface (bottom of boundary layers).\nThis happens near the ring neck in the streamwise direction and besides the\noriginal vortex legs in the spanwise direction.The small length scales then\nrise up from the wall surface and travel to the upper boundary layer.",
