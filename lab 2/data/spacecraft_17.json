    "abstract": "Abstract:  Heat flow is an important constraint on planetary formation and evolution. It\nhas been suggested that Martian obliquity cycles might cause periodic collapses\nin atmospheric pressure, leading to corresponding decreases in regolith thermal\nconductivity (which is controlled by gas in the pore spaces). Geothermal heat\nwould then build up in the subsurface, potentially affecting present-day heat\nflow - and thus the measurements made by a heat-flow probe such as the InSight\nHP$^{3}$ instrument. To gauge the order of magnitude of this effect, we model\nthe diffusion of a putative heat pulse caused by thermal conductivity changes\nwith a simple numerical scheme and compare it to the heat-flow perturbations\ncaused by other effects. We find that an atmospheric collapse to 300 Pa in the\nlast 40 kyr would lead to a present-day heat flow that is up to $2-8\\%$ larger\nthan the average geothermal background. Considering the InSight mission with\nexpected $5-15\\%$ error bars on the HP$^{3}$ measurement, this perturbation\nwould only be significant in the best-case scenario of full instrument\ndeployment, completed measurement campaign, and a well-modelled surface\nconfiguration. The prospects for detecting long-term climate perturbations via\nspacecraft heat-flow experiments remain challenging.",

The type III radio\nemission started at $\\approx$ 13:10~UT and was associated to a C2.1 GOES-class\nflare whose maximum was at 13:11 UT and hosted by the active region NOAA\n8007/8004, located on the west limb at N05$^\\circ$ W74$^\\circ$/N06$^\\circ$\nW85$^\\circ$. During this event, the observation of an electron energy\ndistribution likely to be associated with the radio emission was registered.\nThe electrons arrive at the spacecraft predominantly from the anti-solar\ndirection, suggesting that their general motion is Sunward along a closed\nmagnetic field line. Leblanc et al. (1999) propose a model in which energetic\nelectrons are injected into a coronal flux tube at one of its footpoints,\nreleasing standard type-III emission. As the magnetic field then directs them\nback toward the magnetic-conjugate footpoint of the first, the electrons\nrelease subsequent emission whose radio profile is a quasi-time reversal of the\nstandard. We have constructed a cylindrical flux-rope facsimile of this\nscenario that reproduces the U-burst profiles. We also report observational\nfeatures indicating a secondary electron energy distribution and propose a\nscenario that explains this feature.",

The design analysis and trade studies for\nISRU systems require the consideration of not only the design of the ISRU plant\nitself but also other infrastructure systems (e.g., storage, power) and various\nISRU architecture options (e.g., resource, location, technology). This paper\nproposes a system-level space infrastructure and its logistics design\noptimization framework to perform architecture trade studies. A new space\ninfrastructure logistics optimization problem formulation is proposed that\nconsiders infrastructure subsystems' internal interactions and their external\nsynergistic effects with space logistics simultaneously. Since the full-size\nversion of this proposed problem formulation can be computationally\nprohibitive, a new multi-fidelity optimization formulation is developed by\nvarying the granularity of the commodity type definition over the network\ngraph; this multi-fidelity formulation can find an approximation solution to\nthe full-size problem computationally efficiently with little sacrifice in the\nsolution quality. The proposed problem formulation and method are applied to a\nmulti-mission lunar exploration campaign to demonstrate their values.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The exploration of small bodies in the Solar System is a high priority\nplanetary science. Asteroids, comets, and planetary moons yield important\ninformation about the evolution of the Solar System. Additionally, they could\nprovide resources for a future space economy. While much research has gone into\nexploring asteroids and comets, dedicated spacecraft missions to planetary\nmoons are few and far between. There are three fundamental challenges of a\nspacecraft mission to the planetary moons: The first challenge is that the\nspheres of influence of most moons (except that of Earth) are small and, in\nmany cases, virtually absent. The second is that many moons are tidally locked\nto their planets, which means that an observer on the planet will have an\nentire hemisphere, which is always inaccessible. The third challenge is that at\na given time about half of the region will be in the Sun's shadow. Therefore, a\nsingle spacecraft mission to observe the planetary moon cannot provide complete\ncoverage. Such a complex task can be solved using a swarm approach, where the\nmapping task is delegated to multiple low-cost spacecraft. Clearly, the design\nof a swarm mission for such a dynamic environment is challenging. For this\nreason, we have proposed the Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of\nSwarms (IDEAS) software to perform automated end-to-end design of swarm\nmissions. Specifically, it will use a sub-module known as the Automated Swarm\nDesigner module to find optimal swarm configurations suited for a given\nmission. In our previous work, we have developed the Automated Swarm Design\nmodule to find swarm configurations for asteroid mapping operations. In this\nwork, we will evaluate the capability of the Automated Swarm module to design\nmissions to planetary moons.",

We\nhave used a new approach to predicting this parameter. First, in our study, we\nhave introduced a new definition of the speed of ejection. It can be considered\nas the maximum speed that the CME achieves during the expansion into the\ninterplanetary medium. Additionally, in our research we have used not only\nobservations from the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft but\nalso from Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecrafts. We\nfocus on halo and partial halo CMEs during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle\n24. During this period the STEREO spacecraft were in quadrature position in\nrelation to the Earth. We demonstrated that these conditions of the STEREO\nobservations can be crucial for an accurate determination of the transit times\n(TTs) of CMEs to the Earth. In our research we defined a new initial velocity\nof the CME, the maximum velocity determined from the velocity profiles obtained\nfrom a moving linear fit to five consecutive height time points. This new\napproach can be important from the point of view of space weather as the new\nparameter is highly correlated with the final velocity of ICMEs. It allows one\nto predict the TTs with the same accuracy as previous models. However, what is\nmore important is the fact that the new approach has radically reduced the\nmaximum TT estimation errors to 29 hours. Previous studies determined the TT\nwith a maximum error equal to 50 hours.",

Traditional constellations are often designed for continuous global\ncoverage, and the few existing regional constellation design methods lead to\nsuboptimal solutions for periodically time-varying or spatially-varying\nregional coverage requirements. This paper introduces a new general approach to\ndesign an optimal constellation pattern that satisfies such complex regional\ncoverage requirements. To this end, the circular convolution nature of the\nrepeating ground track orbit and common ground track constellation is\nformalized. This formulation enables a scalable constellation pattern analysis\nfor multiple target areas and with multiple sub-constellations. The formalized\ncircular convolution relationship is first used to derive a baseline\nconstellation pattern design method with the conventional assumption of\nsymmetry. Next, a novel method based on binary integer linear programming is\ndeveloped, which aims to optimally design a constellation pattern with the\nminimum number of satellites. This binary integer linear programming method is\nshown to achieve optimal constellation patterns for general problem settings\nthat the baseline method cannot achieve. Five illustrative examples are\nanalyzed to demonstrate the value of the proposed new approach.",

A long-lasting debate concerns the nature of ion and electron\nscale fluctuations in solar-wind turbulence and their dissipation via\ncollisionless plasma mechanisms.

In this Perspective, we discuss the advances achieved with\nour 3D3V (reduced and fully) kinetic simulations, as well as the main questions\nleft open (or raised) by these studies. To this end, we combine data from our\nrecent kinetic simulations of both freely decaying and continuously driven\nfluctuations to assess the similarities and/or differences in the properties of\nplasma turbulence in the sub-ion range.

We used constraints from limb\nspectra between 50 and 900 cm$^{-1}$ and from in situ measurements by the\nHuygens probe to characterize the temperature, haze and gaseous absorber\nprofiles. We confirm that the N$_2$-CH$_4$ collision-induced absorption (CIA)\ncoefficients used up to now need to be increased by about 52% at temperatures\nof 70-85 K. We find that the N$_2$-N$_2$ CIA coefficients are also too low in\nthe N$_2$ band far wing, beyond 110 cm$^{-1}$, in agreement with recent quantum\nmechanical calculations. We derived a H$_2$ mole fraction equal to (0.88 $\\pm$\n0.13) $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$, which pertains to the $\\sim$1-34 km altitude range\nprobed by the S$_0$(0) and S$_0$(1) lines. The H$_2$ para fraction is close to\nequilibrium in the 20-km region. We have investigated different mechanisms that\nmay operate in Titan's atmosphere to equilibrate the H$_2$ o-p ratio and we\nhave developed a one-dimensional model that solves the continuity equation in\npresence of such conversion mechanisms. We conclude that exchange with H atoms\nin the gas phase or magnetic interaction of H$_2$ in a physisorbed state on the\nsurface of aerosols are too slow compared with atmospheric mixing to play a\nsignificant role. On the other hand, magnetic interaction of H$_2$ with CH$_4$,\nand to a lesser extent N$_2$, can operate on a timescale similar to the\nvertical mixing time in the troposphere. This process is thus likely\nresponsible for the o-p equilibration of H$_2$ in the mid-troposphere implied\nby CIRS measurements.",

Common orbit\ndetermination process noise techniques, such as state noise compensation and\ndynamic model compensation, require offline tuning and a priori knowledge of\nthe dynamical environment. Alternatively, the process noise covariance can be\nestimated through adaptive filtering. However, many adaptive filtering\ntechniques are not applicable to onboard orbit determination due to\ncomputational cost or the assumption of a linear time-invariant system.\nFurthermore, existing adaptive filtering techniques do not constrain the\nprocess noise covariance according to the underlying continuous-time dynamical\nmodel, and there has been limited work on adaptive filtering with colored\nprocess noise. To overcome these limitations, a novel approach is developed\nwhich optimally fuses state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation\nwith covariance matching adaptive filtering. This yields two adaptive and\ndynamically constrained process noise covariance estimation techniques. Unlike\nmany adaptive filtering approaches, the new techniques accurately extrapolate\nover measurement outages and do not rely on ad hoc methods to ensure the\nprocess noise covariance is positive semi-definite. The benefits of the\nproposed algorithms are demonstrated through two case studies: an illustrative\nlinear system and the autonomous navigation of two spacecraft orbiting an\nasteroid.",

The widely accepted compositional model for Mars assumes Mn and\nmore refractory elements are in CI chondrite proportions in the planet,\nincluding Fe, Mg, and Si, which along with O make up $>$90\\% of the mass of\nMars. However, recent improvements in our understandings on the composition of\nthe solar photosphere and meteorites challenge the use of CI chondrite as an\nanalog of Mars. Here we present an alternative model composition for Mars that\navoids such an assumption and is based on data from Martian meteorites and\nspacecraft observations. Our modeling method was previously applied to predict\nthe Earth's composition. The model establishes the absolute abundances of\nrefractory lithophile elements in the bulk silicate Mars (BSM) at 2.26 times\nhigher than that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Relative to this chondritic\ncomposition, Mars has a systematic depletion in moderately volatile lithophile\nelements as a function of their condensation temperatures. Given this finding,\nwe constrain the abundances of siderophile and chalcophile elements in the bulk\nMars and its core. The Martian volatility trend is consistent with $ \\leq $7\nwt\\% S in its core, which is significantly lower than that assumed in most core\nmodels (i.e., $ > $10 wt\\% S).

They are expected to launch in\n2030-2035. Assuming a one-year overlap, we propose the LISA-Taiji network in\nspace to fast and accurately localize the gravitational-wave sources. We use\nthe Fisher information matrix approach to analyze the sky localization for\ncoalescing massive black hole binaries. For an equal-mass black hole binary\nlocated at redshift of 1 with a total intrinsic mass of $10^5 M_{\\odot}$, the\nLISA-Taiji network may achieves about four orders of magnitude improvement on\nthe event localization region compared to an individual detector. The precision\nmeasurement of sky location from the gravitational-wave signal may completely\nidentify the host galaxy with low redshifts prior to the final black hole\nmerger. Such the identification of the host galaxy is helpful for the follow-up\nchange in electromagnetic emissions of the accretion disk when the massive\nblack hole binary merges to a single massive black hole, and enables the\ncoalescing massive black hole binaries to be used as a standard siren.",

For a launch in 2027, we could reach 2I/Borisov in\n2052, using the Space Launch System (SLS), up-scaled Parker probe heat shield\ntechnology, and solid propulsion engines. Using a SLS a spacecraft with a mass\nof 765 kg could be sent to 2I/Borisov. A Falcon Heavy could deliver 202 kg to\n2I/Borisov.

The scientific goals of AMIGO are: to bridge the spectra gap\nbetween first-generation high-frequency and low-frequency GW sensitivities; to\ndetect intermediate mass BH coalescence; to detect inspiral phase and predict\ntime of binary black hole coalescence together with neutron star coalescence\nfor ground interferometers; to detect compact binary inspirals for studying\nstellar evolution and galactic population. The mission concept is to use time\ndelay interferometry for a nearly triangular formation of 3 drag-free\nspacecraft with nominal arm length 10,000 km, emitting laser power 2-10 W and\ntelescope diameter 300-500 mm. The design GW sensitivity in the middle\nfrequency band is 3 x 10^(-21) Hz^(-1/2). Both heliocentric and geocentric\norbits are under study. All options have LISA-like formations, that is the\ntriangular formation is 60 deg inclined to the orbit plane. For AMIGO, the\nfirst-generation time delay interferometry is good enough for the laser\nfrequency noise suppression. We also investigate for each options of orbits\nunder study, whether constant equal-arm implementation is feasible. For the\nsolar-orbit option, the acceleration to maintain the formation can be designed\nto be less than 15 nm/s2 with the thruster requirement in the 15 {\\mu}N range.\nAMIGO would be a good place to implement the constant equal-arm option. Fuel\nrequirement, thruster noise requirement and test mass acceleration actuation\nrequirement are briefly considered. From the orbit study, the solar orbit\noption is the first mission orbit choice. We study the deployment for this\norbit option. A last-stage launch from 300 km LEO (Low Earth Orbit) to an\nappropriate 2-degree-behind-the-Earth AMIGO formation in 95 days requires only\na {\\delta}v of 75 m/s.",

For this multipoint observation to occur, it requires\nmultiple spacecraft to coordinate their actions particularly fixating on the\nspace observation target. Furthermore, communication and coordination are\nneeded for bringing new satellites into observation view and removing other\nsatellites that have lost their view. In this paper, we analyze\nstate-of-the-art observation technology for small satellites and perform\ndetailed design of its implementation.

Coupled with this is the growing number of rocket launches,\nwith left-over debris marking their trail. The space debris problem has also\nbeen compounded by test of several satellite killer missiles that have left\nlarge remnant debris fields. In this paper, we assume a future in which the\nKessler Effect has taken hold and analyze the implications on the design of\nsmall-satellites and CubeSats. We use a multiprong approach of surveying the\nlatest technologies, including the ability to sense space debris in orbit,\nperform obstacle avoidance, have sufficient shielding to take on small impacts\nand other techniques to mitigate the problem. Detecting and tracking space\ndebris threats on-orbit is expected to be an important approach and we will\nanalyze the latest vision algorithms to perform the detection, followed by\nquick reaction control systems to perform the avoidance. Alternately there may\nbe scenarios where the debris is too small to track and avoid. In this case,\nthe spacecraft will need passive mitigation measures to survive the impact.\nBased on these conditions, we develop a strawman design of a small spacecraft\nto mitigate these challenges. Based upon this study, we identify if there is\nsufficient present-day COTS technology to mitigate or shield satellites from\nthe problem. We conclude by outlining technology pathways that need to be\nadvanced now to best prepare ourselves for the worst-case eventuality of\nKessler Effect taking hold in the upper altitudes of Low Earth Orbit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We speculate on the development and availability of new innovative propulsion\ntechniques in the 2040s, that will allow us to fly a spacecraft outside the\nSolar System (at 150 AU and more) in a reasonable amount of time, in order to\ndirectly probe our (gravitational) Solar System neighborhood and answer\npressing questions regarding the dark sector (dark energy and dark matter). We\nidentify two closely related main science goals, as well as secondary\nobjectives that could be fulfilled by a mission dedicated to probing the local\ndark sector: (i) begin the exploration of gravitation's low-acceleration regime\nwith a man-made spacecraft and (ii) improve our knowledge of the local dark\nmatter and baryon densities. Those questions can be answered by directly\nmeasuring the gravitational potential with an atomic clock on-board a\nspacecraft on an outbound Solar System orbit, and by comparing the spacecraft's\ntrajectory with that predicted by General Relativity through the combination of\nranging data and the in-situ measurement (and correction) of non-gravitational\naccelerations with an on-board accelerometer. Despite a wealth of new\nexperiments getting online in the near future, that will bring new knowledge\nabout the dark sector, it is very unlikely that those science questions will be\nclosed in the next two decades. More importantly, it is likely that it will be\neven more urgent than currently to answer them. Tracking a spacecraft carrying\na clock and an accelerometer as it leaves the Solar System may well be the\neasiest and fastest way to directly probe our dark environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work presents a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture\nand a training procedure to enable robust and accurate pose estimation of a\nnoncooperative spacecraft. First, a new CNN architecture is introduced that has\nscored a fourth place in the recent Pose Estimation Challenge hosted by\nStanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB) and the Advanced Concepts Team\n(ACT) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The proposed architecture first\ndetects the object by regressing a 2D bounding box, then a separate network\nregresses the 2D locations of the known surface keypoints from an image of the\ntarget cropped around the detected Region-of-Interest (RoI). In a single-image\npose estimation problem, the extracted 2D keypoints can be used in conjunction\nwith corresponding 3D model coordinates to compute relative pose via the\nPerspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. These keypoint locations have known\ncorrespondences to those in the 3D model, since the CNN is trained to predict\nthe corners in a pre-defined order, allowing for bypassing the computationally\nexpensive feature matching processes. This work also introduces and explores\nthe texture randomization to train a CNN for spaceborne applications.\nSpecifically, Neural Style Transfer (NST) is applied to randomize the texture\nof the spacecraft in synthetically rendered images. It is shown that using the\ntexture-randomized images of spacecraft for training improves the network's\nperformance on spaceborne images without exposure to them during training. It\nis also shown that when using the texture-randomized spacecraft images during\ntraining, regressing 3D bounding box corners leads to better performance on\nspaceborne images than regressing surface keypoints, as NST inevitably distorts\nthe spacecraft's geometric features to which the surface keypoints have closer\nrelation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Waves around the lower hybrid frequency are frequently observed at Earth's\nmagnetopause, and readily reach very large amplitudes. Determining the\nproperties of lower hybrid waves is crucial because they are thought to\ncontribute to electron and ion heating, cross-field particle diffusion,\nanomalous resistivity, and energy transfer between electrons and ions. All\nthese processes could play an important role in magnetic reconnection at the\nmagnetopause and the evolution of the boundary layer. In this paper, the\nproperties of lower hybrid waves at Earth's magnetopause are investigated using\nthe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. For the first time, the properties\nof the waves are investigated using fields and direct particle measurements.\nThe highest-resolution electron moments resolve the velocity and density\nfluctuations of lower hybrid waves, confirming that electrons remain\napproximately frozen in at lower hybrid wave frequencies. Using fields and\nparticle moments the dispersion relation is constructed and the wave-normal\nangle is estimated to be close to $90^{\\circ}$ to the background magnetic\nfield. The waves are shown to have a finite parallel wave vector, suggesting\nthat they can interact with parallel propagating electrons. The observed wave\nproperties are shown to agree with theoretical predictions, the previously used\nsingle-spacecraft method, and four-spacecraft timing analyses. These results\nshow that single-spacecraft methods can accurately determine lower hybrid wave\nproperties.",

The present study is\nan attempt to make an assessment and characterise the coming years in terms of\nsolar activity and space radiation environment especially due to the abundance\nof highly energetic heavy ions (known as HZE charged particles). These HZE\nparticle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts and also to the\ncritical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE\nspecies (from B to Ni) obtained from ACE spacecraft shows a clear enhancement\nof the particle fluxes between the solar cycle 23 and solar cycle 24 (between\nSSN peaks 2002 and 2014) due to the persisting low sunspot numbers of the\nlatter cycle. The peak values of these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag\nof about a year of the corresponding minimum value of the sunspots of a\nparticular 11-year cycle which is pseudo-periodic in nature. This is\ndemonstrated by the Fourier and Wavelet transform analyses of the long duration\n(1700-2018) yearly mean sunspot number data. The same time series data is also\nused to train a Hybrid Regression Neural Network (HRNN) model to generate the\npredicted yearly mean sunspot numbers for the solar cycle 25 (2019-2031). The\nwavelet analysis of this new series of annual sunspot numbers including the\npredictions up to the end of 2031 shows a clear trend of continuation of the\nlow solar activity and hence continuation of very high HZE fluxes prevailing in\nSolar cycle 24 into the solar cycle 25 and perhaps beyond.",

Here we use radiative transfer results of Sromovsky et al. (2019,\nIcarus, this http URL), in conjunction with Monte Carlo\ncalculations and physical models, to show that this interpretation is almost\ncertainly wrong because (1) optically thick eyewalls should produce very bright\nfeatures in the poleward direction that are not seen, while the moderately\nbrighter features that are seen appear in the opposite direction, (2) eyewall\nshadows should be very dark, but the observed shadows create only 5-10\\% I/F\nvariations, (3) radiation transfer modeling of clouds in this region have\ndetected no optically thick wall clouds and no significant variation in\npressures of the model cloud layers, and (4) there is an alternative\nexplanation that is much more consistent with observations. The most plausible\nscenario is that the shadows near 87.9 deg S and 88.9 deg S are both cast by\noverlying translucent aerosol layers from edges created by step decreases in\ntheir optical depths, the first in the stratospheric layer at the 50 mbar level\nand the second in a putative diphosphine layer near 350 mbar, with optical\ndepths reduced at the poleward side of each step by 0.15 and 0.12 respectively\nat 752 nm. These steps are sufficient to create shadows of roughly the correct\nsize and shape, falling mainly on the underlying ammonia ice layer near 900\nmbar, and to create the bright features we call antishadows.",

This paper describes a method for reconstructing the coronal\nelectron density based on spherical harmonics. By assuming a radial structure\nto the corona at the height of interest, line-of-sight integrations can be made\nindividually on each harmonic basis prior to determining coefficients, i.e. the\ncomputationally-expensive integrations are calculated only once during\ninitialization. This approach reduces the problem to finding the set of\ncoefficients which best match the observed brightness using a regularized\nleast-squares approach, and is very efficient. The method is demonstrated on\nsynthetic data created from both a simple and an intricate coronal density\nmodel. The quality of reconstruction is found to be reasonable in the presence\nof noise and large gaps in the data. The method is applied to both LASCO C2 and\nSTEREO COR2 coronagraph observations from 2009/03/20, and the results from both\nspacecraft compared.

The interpretation is non-unique, but Dione's excess\ntopography may suggest some degree of Airy-type isostasy, meaning that the\nouter ice shell is underlain by a higher density, lower viscosity layer, such\nas a subsurface liquid water ocean. The data permit a broad range of\npossibilities, but the best fitting models tend towards large shell thicknesses\nand small ocean thicknesses.",
