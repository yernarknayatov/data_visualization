In particular,\nconstraint satisfaction is guaranteed by taking advantage of set invariance\nproperties, whereas asymptotic convergence is achieved by implementing a\nnon-conservative navigation field which is devoid of undesired stagnation\npoints.

All these events, i.e.,\nerupted but failed to be ejected to become a coronal mass ejection (CME), are\nfailed eruptions with the filament maximum height exceeding $100 Mm$. The\nmagnetic field of filament source regions is approximated by a potential field\nextrapolation method. The filament 3D configuration is reconstructed from three\nvantage points by the observations of STEREO Ahead/Behind and SDO spacecraft.\nWe calculate the decay index at the apex of these failed filaments and find\nthat in 7 cases, their apex decay indexes exceed the theoretical threshold\n($n_{crit} = 1.5$) of the torus instability. We further determine the\norientation change or rotation angle of each filament top during the eruption.\nFinally, the distribution of these events in the parameter space of rotation\nangle versus decay index is established. Four distinct regimes in the parameter\nspace are empirically identified. We find that, all the torus-unstable cases\n(decay index $n > 1.5$), have a large rotation angles ranging from $50^\\circ -\n130^\\circ$. The possible mechanisms leading to the rotation and failed eruption\nare discussed. These results imply that, besides the torus instability, the\nrotation motion during the eruption may also play a significant role in solar\neruptions.",

Typical asteroid interdiction schemes involve spacecraft physically\nintercepting the target, a task feasible only for targets identified decades in\nadvance and in a narrow range of orbits---criteria unlikely to be satisfied by\na threatening comet. Comets, however, are naturally perturbed from purely\ngravitational trajectories through solar heating of their surfaces which\nactivates sublimation-driven jets. Artificial heating of a comet, such as by a\nlaser, may supplement natural heating by the Sun to purposefully manipulate its\npath and thereby avoid an impact. Deflection effectiveness depends on the\ncomet's heating response, which varies dramatically depending on factors\nincluding nucleus size, orbit and dynamical history. These factors are\nincorporated into a numerical orbital model to assess the effectiveness and\nfeasibility of using high-powered laser arrays in Earth orbit and on the ground\nfor comet deflection. Simulation results suggest that a diffraction-limited 500\nm orbital or terrestrial laser array operating at 10 GW for 1% of each day over\n1 yr is sufficient to fully avert the impact of a typical 500 m diameter comet\nwith primary nongravitational parameter A1 = 2 x 10^-8 au d^-2.

We perform 3D\nreconstructions of EUV wave front heights using multi-point observations from\nSTEREO-A and STEREO-B, and study their evolution to properly estimate the EUV\nwave kinematics. We develop two different methods to solve the matching problem\nof the EUV wave crest on pairs of STEREO-A/-B images by combining epipolar\ngeometry with the investigation of perturbation profiles. The proposed\napproaches are applicable at the early and maximum stage of the event when\nSTEREO-A/-B see different facets of the EUV wave, but also at the later stage\nwhen the wave front becomes diffusive and faint. The techniques developed are\ndemonstrated on two events observed at different separation of the STEREO\nspacecraft (42$^\\circ$ and 91$^\\circ$). For the 7 December 2007 event, we find\nthat the emission of the EUV wave front mainly comes from a height range up to\n90-104 Mm, decreasing later to 7-35 Mm. Including the varying height of the EUV\nwave front allows us to correct the wave kinematics for the projection effects,\nresulting in velocities in the range 217-266 km/s. For the 13 February 2009\nevent, the wave front height doubled from 54 to 93 Mm over 10 min, and the\nvelocity derived is 205-208 km/s.

To\ntackle this challenge, this paper develops a novel event-driven space logistics\nnetwork optimization approach using mixed-integer linear programming for space\ncampaign design. An example case of optimally designing a cislunar propellant\nsupply chain to support multiple lunar surface access missions is used to\ndemonstrate this new space logistics framework. The results are compared with\nan existing stochastic combinatorial formulation developed for incorporating\nlow-thrust propulsion into space logistics design; our new approach provides\nsuperior results in terms of cost as well as utilization of the vehicle fleet.\nThe event-driven space logistics network optimization method developed in this\npaper can trade off cost, time, and technology in an automated manner to\noptimally design space mission campaigns.",

We analysed in-situ measurements\nprovided by the two Helios spacecrafts to study the behaviour of the last, the\nstrahl electron population, in the inner Solar system between 0.3 and 1 au. The\nstrahl is characterised with a pitch-angle width (PAW) depending on electron\nenergy and evolving with radial distance. We find different behaviour of the\nstrahl electrons for solar wind separated into types by the core electron beta\nparallel value ($\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$). For the low-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar\nwind the strahl component is more pronounced, and the variation of PAW is\nelectron energy dependent. At low energies a slight focusing over distance is\nobserved, and the strahl PAW measured at 0.34 au agrees with the width\npredicted by a collisionless focusing model. The broadening observed for\nhigher-energy strahl electrons during expansion can be described by an\nexponential relation, which points toward an energy dependent scattering\nmechanism. In the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind the strahl appears\nbroader in consistence with the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ plasma being more\nunstable with respect to kinetic instabilities. Finally we extrapolate our\nobservations to the distance of 0.16 au, predicting the strahl PAWs in the\nlow-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind to be $\\sim$ 29$^o$ for all energies, and\nin the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind a bit broader, ranging between\n37$^o$ and 65$^o$.",

In Paper I we reported that velocity is a key driver in determining the\nappearance of deposits.

We find that mass transfer efficiency increases from $\\sim$1 up to\n$\\sim$10% with increasing monomer diameter from 0.3 $\\mu$m to 1.5 $\\mu$m (i.e.\ntensile strength decreasing from $\\sim$12 to $\\sim$3 kPa), and velocities\nincreasing from 0.5 to 6 m/s. Also, the relative abundance of small fragments\nafter impact is higher for material with higher tensile strength. The\ndegeneracy between the effects of velocity and material strength may be lifted\nby performing a closer study of the deposits. This experimental method makes it\npossible to estimate the mass transfer efficiency in the COSIMA instrument.\nExtrapolating these results implies that more than half of the dust collected\nduring the Rosetta mission has not been imaged. We analysed two COSIMA targets\ncontaining deposits from single collisions. The collision that occurred closest\nto perihelion passage led to more small fragments on the target.",

The observations consist of images of the\ndayside of Venus, most often observed at intervals of 2 hours, but interspersed\nwith longer gaps. The orbit of the spacecraft does not allow for continuous\nobservation of the full dayside, and the unobserved regions cause significant\ngaps in the datasets. Each dataset is subdivided into three subsets for three\nobserving periods, the unobserved data are interpolated and each subset is then\nsubjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) to find six oscillating\npatterns in the albedo. Principal components in all three periods show similar\nmorphologies at 283-nm but are much more variable at 365-nm. Some spatial\npatterns and the time scales of these modes correspond to well known physical\nprocesses in the atmosphere of Venus such as the ~4 day Kelvin wave, 5 day\nRossby waves and the overturning circulation, while others defy a simple\nexplanation.

Their geoeffectiveness is largely determined by their\ndynamic pressure and internal magnetic fields, for which reliable predictions\nat Earth are not possible with traditional cone CME models. We study two\nEarth-directed CMEs using the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information\nAsset (EUHFORIA) model, testing the predictive capabilities of a linear\nforce-free spheromak CME model initialised using parameters derived from\nremote-sensing observations. Using observation-based CME input parameters, we\nperform MHD simulations of the events with the cone and spheromak CME models.\nResults show that spheromak CMEs propagate faster than cone CMEs when\ninitialised with the same kinematic parameters. We interpret these differences\nas due to different Lorentz forces acting within cone and spheromak CMEs,\nleading to different CME expansions. Such discrepancies can be mitigated by\ninitialising spheromak CMEs with a reduced speed corresponding to the radial\nspeed only. Results at Earth evidence that the spheromak model improves the\npredictions of B(Bz) up to 12-60(22-40) percentage points compared to a cone\nmodel. Considering virtual spacecraft located around Earth, B(Bz) predictions\nreach 45-70%(58-78%) of the observed peak values. The spheromak model predicts\ninaccurate magnetic field parameters at Earth for CMEs propagating away from\nthe Sun-Earth line, while it successfully predicts the CME properties and\narrival time in the case of strictly Earth-directed events. Modelling CMEs\npropagating away from the Sun-Earth line requires extra care due to limitations\nrelated to the assumed spherical shape. The spatial variability of modelling\nresults and the typical uncertainties in the reconstructed CME direction\nadvocate the need to consider predictions at Earth and at virtual spacecraft\naround it.",

The aim of this\npaper is to generalize the previously obtained equations to the processes in\nthe external bow shock region.

In this article, the\ntotal open heliospheric magnetic flux is computed using two different methods\nand then compared with results obtained from in-situ interplanetary\nmagnetic-field observations. The first method uses two different types of\nphotospheric magnetic-field maps as input to the Wang Sheeley Arge (WSA) model:\ni) traditional Carrington or diachronic maps, and ii) Air Force Data\nAssimilative Photospheric Flux Transport model synchronic maps. The second\nmethod uses observationally derived helium and extreme-ultraviolet coronal-hole\nmaps overlaid on the same magnetic-field maps in order to compute total open\nmagnetic flux. The diachronic and synchronic maps are both constructed using\nmagnetograms from the same source, namely the National Solar Observatory Kitt\nPeak Vacuum Telescope and Vector Spectromagnetograph. The results of this work\nshow that the total open flux obtained from observationally derived coronal\nholes agrees remarkably well with that derived from WSA, especially near solar\nminimum. This suggests that, on average, coronal models capture well the\nobserved large-scale coronal-hole structure over most of the solar cycle. Both\nmethods show considerable deviations from total open flux deduced from\nspacecraft data, especially near solar maximum, pointing to something other\nthan poorly determined coronal-hole area specification as the source of these\ndiscrepancies.",

It is found that generally for radius smaller than $4M$ or\nvelocity larger than $c/\\sqrt{2}$ there will be no bound orbits. While for\nfixed radius larger than $4M$ (or velocity smaller than $c/\\sqrt{2}$), as\nvelocity (or radius) increase from zero (or $2M$), the particle is always\ncaptured until a critical value $v_{\\mathrm{crit1}}$ (or $r_{\\mathrm{crit1}}$)\nwhen the bound orbit start to appear around $\\alpha=\\pi/2$ between a\ndouble-napped cone structure. As the velocity (or radius) increases to another\ncritical value $v_{\\mathrm{crit2}}$ (or $r_{\\mathrm{crit2}}$) then the bound\ndirections and escape directions in the outward cone become escape directions,\nleaving only the inward cone separating the capture and bound directions. The\nangle of this cone will increase to its asymptotic value as velocity (or\nradius) increases to its asymptotic value. The implication of these results in\nshadow of black holes formed by massive particles, in black hole accretion and\nin spacecraft navigation is briefly discussed.",

Expressed in kilometers, the distances ranged\nbetween 38~km and $\\sim$10$^4$~km. We show that magnetic field profiles and the\nlocal shock normals of observed shocks are very similar when the spacecraft are\nof the order of one d$_i$ apart, but are strikingly different when the\ndistances increase to ten or more d$_i$. We interpret these differences to be\ndue to the irregular surface of IP shocks and discuss possible causes for such\nirregularity. We strengthen our interpretation by comparing observed shock\nprofiles with profiles of simulated shocks. The latter had similar\ncharacteristics (M$_A$, $\\theta_{BN}$, upstream ion $\\beta$) as observed shocks\nand the profiles were obtained at separations across the simulation domain\nequivalent to the Cluster inter-spacecraft distances.",

Therefore, the predicted small CMEs may also be\nfrequently associated with small prominence eruptions. In this work, we aim to\nsearch for cool prominence materials within SMFRs.We examined all the O5+ and\nFe6+ fraction data obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft\nduring 1998 to 2008 and found that 13 SMFRs might exhibit low-charge-state\nsignatures of unusual O5+and/or Fe6+abundances.One of the 13 SMFRs also\nexhibited signatures of high ionic charge states. We also reported a SMFR with\nhighFe6+ fraction, but the values of Fe6+is a little lower than the threshold\ndefining unusualFe6+.However, the SDO/AIA observations confirmed that the\nprogenitor CME of this SMFR is associated with a small eruptive prominence, and\nthe observations also supported the prominence materials were embedded in the\nCME.These observations are at the edge of the capabilities of ACE/SWICS and it\ncannot be ruled out that they are solely caused by instrumental effects. If\nthese observations are real, they provide new evidence for the conjecture that\nSMFRs are small-scale MCs but also imply that the connected small CMEs could be\nassociated with flares and prominence eruptions.",

Among them the most common are an enhanced and smoothly rotating\nmagnetic field, a low proton temperature and a low plasma beta. However, these\nfeatures are not all observed for each ICME due to their strong variability.\nVisual detection is time-consuming and biased by the observer interpretation\nleading to non exhaustive, subjective and thus hardly reproducible catalogs.\nUsing convolutional neural networks on sliding windows and peak detection, we\nprovide a fast, automatic and multi-scale detection of ICMEs. The method has\nbeen tested on the in-situ data from WIND between 1997 and 2015 and on the 657\nICMEs that were recorded during this period. The method offers an unambiguous\nvisual proxy of ICMEs that gives an interpretation of the data similar to what\nan expert observer would give. We found at a maximum 197 of the 232 ICMEs of\nthe 2010-2015 period (recall 84 +-4.5 % including 90% of the ICMEs present in\nthe lists of Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2015) and Chi et al. (2016). The minimal\nnumber of False Positives was 25 out of 158 predicted ICMEs (precision\n84+-2.6%). Although less accurate, the method also works with one or several\nmissing input parameters. The method has the advantage of improving its\nperformance by just increasing the amount of input data. The generality of the\nmethod paves the way for automatic detection of many different event signatures\nin spacecraft in-situ measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This white paper submitted for 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science\nconcerns the importance of multi-spacecraft missions to address fundamental\nquestions concerning plasma turbulence. Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in the\nuniverse, and it is responsible for the transport of mass, momentum, and energy\nin such diverse systems as the solar corona and wind, accretion discs, planet\nformation, and laboratory fusion devices. Turbulence is an inherently\nmulti-scale and multi-process phenomenon, coupling the largest scales of a\nsystem to sub-electron scales via a cascade of energy, while simultaneously\ngenerating reconnecting current layers, shocks, and a myriad of instabilities\nand waves. The solar wind is humankind's best resource for studying the\nnaturally occurring turbulent plasmas that permeate the universe. Since\nlaunching our first major scientific spacecraft mission, Explorer 1, in 1958,\nwe have made significant progress characterizing solar wind turbulence. Yet,\ndue to the severe limitations imposed by single point measurements, we are\nunable to characterize sufficiently the spatial and temporal properties of the\nsolar wind, leaving many fundamental questions about plasma turbulence\nunanswered. Therefore, the time has now come wherein making significant\nadditional progress to determine the dynamical nature of solar wind turbulence\nrequires multi-spacecraft missions spanning a wide range of scales\nsimultaneously. A dedicated multi-spacecraft mission concurrently covering a\nwide range of scales in the solar wind would not only allow us to directly\ndetermine the spatial and temporal structure of plasma turbulence, but it would\nalso mitigate the limitations that current multi-spacecraft missions face, such\nas non-ideal orbits for observing solar wind turbulence. Some of the\nfundamentally important questions that can only be addressed by in situ\nmultipoint measurements are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  During the thirteen years in orbit around Saturn before its final plunge, the\nCassini spacecraft provided more than ten thousand astrometric measurements.\nSuch large amounts of accurate data enable the search for extremely faint\nsignals in the orbital motion of the saturnian moons. Among these, the\ndetection of the dynamical feedback of the rotation of the inner moons of\nSaturn on their respective orbits becomes possible. Using all the currently\navailable astrometric data associated with Atlas, Prometheus, Pandora, Janus\nand Epimetheus, we first provide a detailed analysis of the Cassini Imaging\nScience Subsystem (ISS) data, with special emphasis on their statistical\nbehavior and sources of bias. Then, we give updated estimates of the moons'\naveraged densities and try to infer more details about their interior\nproperties by estimating the physical librations for Prometheus, Pandora,\nEpimetheus and Janus from anomalies in their apsidal precession. Our results\nare compatible with a homogeneous interior for Janus and Epimetheus, within the\nuncertainty of the measurements. On the other hand, we found some inconsistency\nfor Pandora and Prometheus, which might result from a dynamical mismodeling of\nSaturn's gravity field. Last, we show how the synergistic introduction of\nlibration measurements directly derived from imaging should allow the moons'\nmoments of inertia to be better constrained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Gravitational slingshots around a neutron star in a compact binary have been\nproposed as a means of accelerating large masses to potentially relativistic\nspeeds. Such a slingshot is attractive since fuel is not expended for the\nacceleration, however it does entail a spacecraft diving into close proximity\nof the binary, which could be hazardous. It is proposed here that such a\nslingshot can be performed remotely using a beam of light which follows a\nboomerang null geodesic. Using a moving black hole as a gravitational mirror,\nkinetic energy from the black hole is transferred to the beam of light as a\nblueshift and upon return the recycled photons not only accelerate, but also\nadd energy to, the spacecraft. It is shown here that this gained energy can be\nlater expended to reach a terminal velocity of approximately 133% the velocity\nof the black hole. A civilization could exploit black holes as galactic way\npoints but would be difficult to detect remotely, except for an elevated binary\nmerger rate and excess binary eccentricity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context. Radio occultation is a technique used to study planetary atmospheres\nby means of the refraction and absorption of a spacecraft carrier signal\nthrough the atmosphere of the celestial body of interest, as detected from a\nground station on Earth. This technique is usually employed by the deep space\ntracking and communication facilities (e.g., NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN),\nESA's Estrack). Aims. We want to characterize the capabilities of the Planetary\nRadio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) technique for radio\noccultation experiments, using radio telescopes equipped with Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) instrumentation. Methods. We conducted a test\nwith ESA's Venus Express (VEX), to evaluate the performance of the PRIDE\ntechnique for this particular application. We explain in detail the data\nprocessing pipeline of radio occultation experiments with PRIDE, based on the\ncollection of so-called open-loop Doppler data with VLBI stations, and perform\nan error propagation analysis of the technique. Results. With the VEX test case\nand the corresponding error analysis, we have demonstrated that the PRIDE setup\nand processing pipeline is suited for radio occultation experiments of\nplanetary bodies. The noise budget of the open-loop Doppler data collected with\nPRIDE indicated that the uncertainties in the derived density and temperature\nprofiles remain within the range of uncertainties reported in previous Venus'\nstudies. Open-loop Doppler data can probe deeper layers of thick atmospheres,\nsuch as that of Venus, when compared to closed-loop Doppler data. Furthermore,\nPRIDE through the VLBI networks around the world, provides a wide coverage and\nrange of large antenna dishes, that can be used for this type of experiments.",
