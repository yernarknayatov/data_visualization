    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space-based interferometric gravitational wave instruments such as the\nESA/NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observe gravitational waves\nby measuring changes in the light travel time between widely-separated\nspacecraft. One potential noise source for these instruments is interaction\nwith the solar wind, in particular the free electrons in the interplanetary\nplasma. Variations in the integrated column density of free electrons along the\nlaser links will lead to time-of-flight delays which directly compete with\nsignals produced by gravitational waves. In this paper we present a simplified\nmodel of the solar plasma relevant for this problem, anchor key parameters of\nour model using data from the NASA \\emph{Wind}/SWE instrument, and derive\nestimates for the effect in the LISA measurement. We find that under normal\nsolar conditions, the gravitational-wave sensitivity limit from the\nfree-electron effect is smaller than other noise sources that are expected to\nlimit LISA's sensitivity.",

To maintain the laser-link between\nsatellites, the LRI uses the beam steering method: a Fast Steering Mirror (FSM)\nis actuated to correct for misalignment between the incoming and outgoing laser\nbeams. From the FSM commands, we can compute the inter-satellite pitch and yaw\nangles. These angles provide information about the spacecraft's relative\norientation with respect to line-of-sight (LOS). We analyze LRI derived\ninter-satellite pointing angles for 2019 and 2020.

Comets 46P/Wirtanen\nand 103P/Hartley 2 are two examples of this cometary class. Based on\nobservations of comet Hartley 2 by the Deep Impact spacecraft, hyperactivity\nappears to be caused by the ejection of water-ice grains and/or water-ice rich\nchunks of nucleus into the coma. These materials increase the sublimating\nsurface area, and yield high water production rates. The historic close\napproach of comet Wirtanen to Earth in 2018 afforded an opportunity to test\nHartley 2 style hyperactivity in a second Jupiter-family comet. We present high\nspatial resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy of the inner coma of Wirtanen.\nNo evidence for the 1.5- or 2.0-$\\mu$m water-ice absorption bands is found in\nsix 0.8-2.5 $\\mu$m spectra taken around perihelion and closest approach to\nEarth. In addition, the strong 3.0-$\\mu$m water-ice absorption band is absent\nin a 2.0-5.3 $\\mu$m spectrum taken near perihelion. Using spectroscopic and\nsublimation lifetime models we set constraints on the physical properties of\nthe ice grains in the coma, assuming they are responsible for the comet's\nhyperactivity. We rule out pure water-ice grains of any size, given their long\nlifetime. Instead, the hyperactivity of the nucleus and lack of water-ice\nabsorption features in our spectra can be explained either by icy grains on the\norder of 1 $\\mu$m in size with a small amount of low albedo dust (greater than\n0.5% by volume), or large chunks containing significant amounts of water ice.",

We analyzed high-resolution images of the Wosret region acquired\nbetween 2015 and 2016 by the OSIRIS instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft.\nWe observed a few morphological changes in Wosret, related to local dust\ncoating removal with an estimated depth of $\\sim$ 1 m, along with the formation\nof a cavity measuring 30 m in length and 6.5 m in depth, for a total estimated\nmass loss of 1.2 $\\times$ 10$^6$ kg. The spectrophotometry of the region is\ntypical of medium-red regions of comet 67P, with spectral slope values of 15-16\n\\%/(100 nm) in pre-perihelion data acquired at phase angle 60$^o$. Wosret has a\nspectral phase reddening of 0.0546 $\\times 10^{-4}$ nm$^{-1} deg^{-1}$, which\nis about a factor of 2 lower than what was determined for the nucleus northern\nhemisphere regions, possibly indicating a reduced surface micro-roughness due\nto the lack of widespread dust coating. A few tiny bright spots are observed.\nMorphological features such as \"goosebumps\" or clods are widely present and\nlarger in size than similar features located in the big lobe. Compared to Anhur\nand Khonsu, two southern hemisphere regions in the big lobe which are also\nexposed to high insolation during perihelion, Wosret exhibits fewer exposed\nvolatiles and less morphological variations due to activity events. Our\nanalysis indicates that the small lobe has different physical and mechanical\nproperties than the big one and a lower volatile content, at least in its\nuppermost layers. These results support the hypothesis that comet 67P\noriginated from the merging of two distinct bodies in the early Solar System.",

The\ncomposition (including the ionic charge states and elemental abundances) is\ndetermined prior to and/or during CME eruptions in the solar atmosphere, and\ndoes not alter during magnetic cloud propagation to 1 AU and beyond. It has\nbeen known that the composition is not uniform within a cross section\nperpendicular to magnetic cloud axis, and the distribution of ionic charge\nstates within a cross section provides us an important clue to investigate the\nformation and eruption processes of flux ropes due to the freeze-in effect. The\nflux rope is a three dimensional magnetic structure intrinsically, and it\nremains unclear whether the composition is uniform along the flux rope axis as\nmost magnetic clouds are only detected by one spacecraft. In this paper we\nreport a magnetic cloud that was observed by ACE near 1 AU on 1998 March 4--6\nand Ulysses near 5.4 AU on March 24--28 sequentially. At these times, both\nspacecraft were located around the ecliptic plane, and the latitudinal and\nlongitudinal separations between them were $\\sim$2.2$^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim$5.5$^{\\circ}$, respectively. It provides us an excellent opportunity to\nexplore the axial inhomogeneity of flux rope composition, as both spacecraft\nalmost intersected the cloud center at different sites along its axis. Our\nstudy shows that the average values of ionic charge states exhibit significant\ndifference along the axis for carbon, and the differences are relatively slight\nbut still obvious for charge states of oxygen and iron, as well as the\nelemental abundances of iron and helium. Besides the means, the composition\nprofiles within the cloud measured by both spacecraft also exhibit some\ndiscrepancies. We conclude that the inhomogeneity of composition exists along\nthe cloud axis.",

To achieve the best possible measurements, cross-calibration of the\nplasma instruments is needed. We construct with two different physical models\nto cross-calibrate the electron density as measured by the Mutual Impedance\nProbe (MIP) to the ion current and spacecraft potential as measured by the\nRosetta Langmuir Probe (LAP), the latter validated with the Ion Composition\nAnalyser (ICA). We retrieve a continuous plasma density dataset for the entire\ncometary mission with a much improved dynamical range compared to any plasma\ninstrument alone and, at times, improve the temporal resolution from\n0.24-0.74~Hz to 57.8~Hz. The new density dataset is consistent with the\nexisting MIP density dataset and covers long time periods where densities were\ntoo low to be measured by MIP. The physical model also yields, at 3~hour time\nresolution, ion flow speeds as well as a proxy for the solar EUV flux from the\nphotoemission from the Langmuir Probes. We report on two independent\nmission-wide estimates of the ion flow speed which are consistent with the bulk\nH$_2$O$^+$ ion velocities as measured by ICA. We find the ion flow to\nconsistently be much faster than the neutral gas over the entire mission,\nlending further evidence that the ions are collisionally decoupled from the\nneutrals in the coma. RPC measurements of ion speeds are therefore not\nconsistent with the assumptions made in previously published plasma density\nmodels of the comet ionosphere at the start and end of the mission. Also, the\nmeasured EUV flux is perfectly consistent with independently derived values\npreviously published from Johansson et al. (2017) and lends support for the\nconclusions drawn therein.",

The event under study is intriguing in several aspects: 1)\nlow-coronal eruptive signatures come in ''pairs'' (a double-peak flare, two\ncoronal dimmings, and two EUV waves); 2) although the event is characterized by\na complete chain of eruptive signatures, the corresponding coronagraphic\nsignatures are weak; 3) although the source region of the eruption is located\nclose to the center of the solar disc and the eruption is thus presumably\nEarth-directed, heliospheric signatures are very weak with little Earth-impact.\nWe analyze a number of multi-spacecraft and multi-instrument (both\nremote-sensing and in situ) observations, including Soft X-ray, (extreme-)\nultraviolet (E)UV), radio and white-light emission, as well as plasma, magnetic\nfield and particle measurements. We employ 3D NLFF modeling to investigate the\ncoronal magnetic field configuration in and around the active region, the GCS\nmodel to make a 3D reconstruction of the CME geometry and the 3D MHD numerical\nmodel EUHFORIA to model the background state of the heliosphere. Our results\nindicate two subsequent eruptions of two systems of sheared and twisted\nmagnetic fields, which merge already in the upper corona and start to evolve\nfurther out as a single entity. The large-scale magnetic field significantly\ninfluences both, the early and the interplanetary evolution of the structure.\nDuring the first eruption the stability of the overlying field was disrupted\nwhich enabled the second eruption. We find that during the propagation in the\ninterplanetary space the large-scale magnetic field, i.e. , the location of\nheliospheric current sheet between the AR and the Earth likely influences\npropagation and the evolution of the erupted structure(s).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts many known high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs), and all but one (SMC X-1) have a Be companion star. Through\nthe calibration and verification phase of eROSITA on board the\nSpektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) spacecraft, the Be/X-ray binary XMMU\nJ010429.4-723136 was in the field of view during observations of the supernova\nremnant, 1E0102.2-7219, used as a calibration standard.\nAims. We report timing and spectral analyses of XMMU J010429.4-723136 based\non three eROSITA observations of the field, two of which were performed on 2019\nNovember 7-9, with the third on 2020 June 18-19. We also reanalyse the OGLE-IV\nlight curve for that source in order to determine the orbital period.\nMethods. We performed a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to search for\npulsations (from the X-ray data) and for the orbital period (from the OGLE\ndata). X-ray spectral parameters and fluxes were retrieved from the best-fit\nmodel.\nResults. We detect, for the first time, the pulsations of XMMU\nJ010429.4-723136 at a period of ~164 s, and therefore designate the source as\nSXP 164. From the spectral fitting, we derive a source flux of ~1x10e-12 erg\ns-1 cm-2 for all three observations, corresponding to a luminosity of ~4x10e35\nerg s-1 at the distance of the SMC. Furthermore, reanalysing the OGLE light\ncurve, including the latest observations, we find a significant periodic signal\nthat we believe is likely be the orbital period; at 22.3d, this is shorter than\nthe previously reported values. The Swift/XRT light curve, extracted from two\nlong monitorings of the field and folded at the same period, suggests that a\nmodulation is also present in the X-ray data.",

Having knowledge of potential impacts on modern society in\nadvance is key for many end-user applications. This covers not only the timing\nof severe geomagnetic storms but also predictions of substorm onsets at polar\nlatitudes. In this study we aim at contributing to the timing problem of space\nweather impacts and propose a new method to predict the solar wind propagation\ndelay between Lagrangian point L1 and the Earth based on machine learning,\nspecifically decision tree models. The propagation delay is measured from the\nidentification of interplanetary discontinuities detected by the Advanced\nComposition Explorer (ACE) and their subsequent sudden commencements in the\nmagnetosphere recorded by ground-based magnetometers. A database of the\npropagation delay has been constructed on this principle including 380\ninterplanetary shocks. The feature set consists of six features, the three\ncomponents of each the solar wind speed and position of ACE around L1. The\nmachine learning results are compared to the flat propagation delay and the\nmethod based on the normal vector of solar wind discontinuities (vector delay).\nThe ML model achieves an RMSE of 4.5 min with respect to the measured solar\nwind propagation delay and also outperforms the physical flat and vector delay\nmodels by 50 \\% and 15 \\% respectively. To increase the confidence in the\npredictions of the trained GB model, we perform a performance validation,\nprovide feature importance and analyse the feature impact on the model output\nwith Shapley values. The major advantage of the machine learning approach is\nits simplicity when it comes to its application. After training, input from\nonly one ACE datapoint have to be fed into the algorithm for a prediction.",

In a static spherically symmetric gravitational\nfield Faraday rotation is purely a reference frame (gauge) effect. This is so\nalso in the leading post-Newtonian expansion of the Earth's gravitational\nfield. However, establishing the local reference frame with respect to distant\nstars leads to the nonzero Faraday phase. In communications between a ground\nstation and an Earth-orbiting spacecraft this phase is of the order of 10^-10.\nUnder the same conditions the Wigner phase of special relativity is typically\nof the order 10^-4--10^-5. These phases lead to the physical lower bound on\ncommunication errors. However, both types of errors can be simultaneously\nmitigated.

Inferring the magnetic\nfield structure across the observatory, and not simply at the observation\npoints, is a necessary step towards characterizing fundamental plasma processes\nusing these unique multi-point, multi-scale data sets. We propose improvements\nupon the classic first-order reconstruction method, as well as a second-order\nmethod, utilizing magnetometer measurements from a realistic nine-spacecraft\nobservatory. The improved first-order method, which averages over select\nensembles of four spacecraft, reconstructs the magnetic field associated with\nsimple current sheets and numerical simulations of turbulence accurately over\nlarger volumes compared to second-order methods or first-order methods using a\nsingle regular tetrahedron. Using this averaging method on data sets with fewer\nthan nine measurement points, the volume of accurate reconstruction compared to\na known magnetic vector field improves approximately linearly with the number\nof measurement points.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Real-time remote sensing applications like search and rescue missions,\nmilitary target detection, environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and\nother time-critical applications require onboard real time processing\ncapabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems like\nsatellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the\nspacecraft and data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a\nwireless radio link. This link may not be available for extended periods when\nthe satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station. Therefore,\nlightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for\nonboard real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and\nresolution of recent hyperspectral imaging sensors, additional challenges are\nposed upon remote sensing processing systems and more capable computing\narchitectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as\npromising architecture for light weight high performance computing that can\naddress these computational requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this\nstudy is to build high performance methods for onboard hyperspectral analysis.\nWe propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive hierarchical\nsegmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a\nGPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to\nprovide rich classification information with several output levels. The\nachieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential\nimplementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node\ncomputer clusters with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to\n74% using a single GPU compared to the equivalent parallel CPU cluster.",

This is realized by two main instruments in\nthe 15 keV to 10 MeV range, the spectrometer SPI (spectral resolution 3 keV at\n1.8 MeV) and the imager IBIS (angular resolution 12 arcmin FWHM), complemented\nby X-ray (JEM-X; 3-35 keV) and optical (OMC; Johnson V-band) monitors. All\ninstruments are co-aligned to simultaneously observe the target region. A\nparticle radiation monitor (IREM) measures charged particle fluxes near the\nspacecraft. The Anti-coincidence subsystems of the main instruments are also\nefficient all-sky gamma-ray detectors, which provide omni-directional\nmonitoring above ~75 keV. INTEGRAL can also rapidly (within a couple of hours)\nre-point and conduct Target of Opportunity observations. INTEGRAL has build an\nimpressive legacy: e.g. discovery of >600 new high-energy sources; first-ever\ndirect detection of 56Ni and 56Co radio-active decay lines from a Type Ia\nsupernova; new insights on positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge and\ndisk; pioneering gamma-ray polarization studies. INTEGRAL is also a successful\nin multi-messenger astronomy: INTEGRAL found the first prompt electromagnetic\nradiation in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger. More than 1750\npapers based on INTEGRAL data have been published in refereed journals.

We demonstrate application of our results to models of\nplausible asymmetry from the literature within the oceans of Europa and Miranda\nand the ionospheres of Callisto and Triton. For the models we consider, we find\nthat in the asymmetric case, the induced magnetic field differs by more than 2\nnT near the surface of Europa, 0.25$-$0.5 nT at 1 $R$ above Miranda and Triton,\nand is essentially unchanged for Callisto. For Miranda and Triton, this\ndifference is as much as 20$-$30% of the induced field magnitude. If\nmeasurements near the moons can be made precisely to better than a few tenths\nof a nT, these values may be used by future spacecraft investigations to\ncharacterize asymmetry within the interior of icy moons.",

Yet, the scarcity of radially aligned CME crossings\nrestricts investigations on the evolution of CME magnetic structures to a few\ncase studies, preventing a comprehensive understanding of CME complexity\nchanges during propagation. In this paper, we perform numerical simulations of\nCMEs interacting with different solar wind streams using the linear force-free\nspheromak CME model incorporated into the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting\nInformation Asset (EUHFORIA) model. The novelty of our approach lies in the\ninvestigation of the evolution of CME complexity using a swarm of radially\naligned, simulated spacecraft. Our scope is to determine under which\nconditions, and to what extent, CMEs exhibit variations of their magnetic\nstructure and complexity during propagation, as measured by spacecraft that are\nradially aligned. Results indicate that the interaction with large-scale solar\nwind structures, and particularly with stream interaction regions, doubles the\nprobability to detect an increase of the CME magnetic complexity between two\nspacecraft in radial alignment, compared to cases without such interactions.\nThis work represents the first attempt to quantify the probability of detecting\ncomplexity changes in CME magnetic structures by spacecraft in radial alignment\nusing numerical simulations, and it provides support to the interpretation of\nmulti-point CME observations involving past, current (such as Parker Solar\nProbe and Solar Orbiter), and future missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Reliable and efficient trajectory generation methods are a fundamental need\nfor autonomous dynamical systems of tomorrow. The goal of this article is to\nprovide a comprehensive tutorial of three major convex optimization-based\ntrajectory generation methods: lossless convexification (LCvx), and two\nsequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this\narticle, trajectory generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible\nstate and control signal that satisfies a set of constraints while optimizing\nkey mission objectives. The trajectory generation problem is almost always\nnonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient\nand reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle. The three algorithms that\nwe discuss use problem reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to\nnonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a\nconvex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by\nconvex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and\nindustry circles. To date, the list of applications includes rocket landing,\nspacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion\nplanning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and\nmore. Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted by\norganizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This\narticle aims to give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work\nwith each algorithm, and to know what each method can and cannot do. A publicly\navailable source code repository supports the provided numerical examples. By\nthe end of the article, the reader should be ready to use the methods, to\nextend them, and to contribute to their many exciting modern applications.",

These rates are applied to negative ions outflowing from\nEuropa, Enceladus, Titan, Dione and Rhea and their trajectories are traced to\nconstrain source production rates and the extent to which negative ions are\nable to pervade the surrounding space environments.

Hence, their realistic\ntreatment in N-body studies is critical to accurately model the formation of\nterrestrial planets and to develop interpretations of telescopic and spacecraft\nobservations. In this work, we compare the effects of two collision\nprescriptions on the core-mantle differentiation of terrestrial planets: a\nmodel in which collisions are always completely accretionary (``perfect\nmerging'') and a more realistic model based on neural networks that has been\ntrained on hydrodynamical simulations of giant impacts. The latter model is\nable to predict the loss of mass due to imperfect accretion and the evolution\nof non-accreted projectiles in hit-and-run collisions. We find that the results\nof the neural-network model feature a wider range of final core mass fractions\nand metal-silicate equilibration pressures, temperatures, and oxygen fugacities\nthan the assumption of perfect merging. When used to model collisions in N-body\nstudies of terrestrial planet formation, the two models provide similar answers\nfor planets more massive than 0.1 Earth's masses. For less massive final\nbodies, however, the inefficient-accretion model predicts a higher degree of\ncompositional diversity. This phenomenon is not reflected in planet formation\nmodels of the solar system that use perfect merging to determine collisional\noutcomes. Our findings confirm the role of giant impacts as important drivers\nof planetary diversity and encourage a realistic implementation of inefficient\naccretion in future accretion studies.",

However, there are cases in which a CME that is well observed in\ncoronagraph data is missing a clear low-coronal counterpart. These events have\nreceived attention during recent years, mainly as a result of the increased\navailability of multi-point observations, and are now known as 'stealth CMEs'.\nIn this work, we analyse examples of stealth CMEs featuring various levels of\nambiguity. All the selected case studies produced a large-scale CME detected by\ncoronagraphs and were observed from at least one secondary viewpoint, enabling\na priori knowledge of their approximate source region. To each event, we apply\nseveral image processing and geometric techniques with the aim to evaluate\nwhether such methods can provide additional information compared to the study\nof \"normal\" intensity images. We are able to identify at least weak eruptive\nsignatures for all events upon careful investigation of remote-sensing data,\nnoting that differently processed images may be needed to properly interpret\nand analyse elusive observations. We also find that the effectiveness of\ngeometric techniques strongly depends on the CME propagation direction with\nrespect to the observers and the relative spacecraft separation. Being able to\nobserve and therefore forecast stealth CMEs is of great importance in the\ncontext of space weather, since such events are occasionally the solar\ncounterparts of so-called 'problem geomagnetic storms'.",

It is often studied from the edge-on perspective\nfor the morphological similarity with the two-dimensional ``standard'' picture,\nbut its three dimensional structure can only be revealed when the flare arcade\nis observed side on. The structure and dynamics in the so-called supra-arcade\nregion thus contain important clues to the physical processes in flares and\nCMEs. Here we focus on the supra-arcade spikes (SASs), interpreted as the VCS\nviewed side-on, to study their spatiotemporal structures. By identifying each\nindividual spike during the decay phase of four selected flares, in which the\nassociated CME is traversed by a near-Earth spacecraft, we found that the\nwidths of spikes are log-normal distributed, while the Fourier power spectra of\nthe overall supra-arcade EUV emission, including bright spikes and dark\ndownflows as well as the diffuse background, are power-law distributed, in\nterms of either spatial frequency $k$ or temporal frequency $\\nu$, which\nreflects the fragmentation of the VCS. We demonstrate that coronal\nemission-line intensity observations dominated by Kolmogorov turbulence would\nexhibit a power spectrum of $E(k)\\sim k^{-13/3}$ or $E(\\nu)\\sim \\nu^{-7/2}$,\nwhich is consistent with our observations. By comparing the number of SASs and\nthe turns of field lines as derived from the ICMEs, we found a consistent axial\nlength of $\\sim\\,$3.5 AU for three events with a CME speed of $\\sim\\,$1000 km/s\nin the inner heliosphere, but a much longer axial length $\\sim\\,$8 AU) for the\nfourth event with an exceptionally fast CME speed of $\\sim\\,$1500 km/s,\nsuggesting that this ICME is flattened and its `nose' has well passed the Earth\nwhen the spacecraft traversed its leg.",

We find that the presence of the shock and other\ncompression signatures at 1 au are due to the CME having been overtaken and\naccelerated by a high speed solar wind stream (HSS). We estimate the minimum\ninteraction time between the CME and the HSS to be about 2.5 days, indicating\nthe interaction started well before the CME arrival at PSP and STEREO-A.\nDespite alterations of the CME by the HSS, we find that the CME magnetic field\nstructure is similar between the vantage points, with overall the same flux\nrope classification and the same field distortions present.

The proposed method involves two steps. The first step is to\nderive a deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem (DNOC) with convex\nconstraints that are surrogate to the SNOC by using gPC expansion and the\ndistributionally-robust convex subset of the chance constraints. The second\nstep is to solve the DNOC problem using sequential convex programming (SCP) for\ntrajectory generation and control. We prove that in the unconstrained case, the\noptimal value of the DNOC converges to that of SNOC asymptotically and that any\nfeasible solution of the constrained DNOC is a feasible solution of the\nchance-constrained SNOC. We derive a stable stochastic model predictive\ncontroller using the gPC-SCP for tracking a trajectory in the presence of\nuncertainty.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We report observations of the Jupiter Trojan asteroid (3548) Eurybates and\nits satellite Queta with the Hubble Space Telescope and use these observations\nto perform an orbital fit to the system. Queta orbits Eurybates with a\nsemimajor axis of $2350\\pm11$ km at a period of $82.46\\pm0.06$ days and an\neccentricity of $0.125\\pm0.009$. From this orbit we derive a mass of Eurybates\nof $1.51\\pm0.03 \\times 10^{17}$ kg, corresponding to an estimated density of\n$1.1\\pm0.3$ g cm$^{-3}$, broadly consistent with densities measured for other\nTrojans, C-type asteroids in the outer main asteroid belt, and small icy\nobjects from the Kuiper belt. Eurybates is the parent body of the only major\ncollisional family among the Jupiter Trojans; its low density suggests that it\nis a typical member of the Trojan population. Detailed study of this system in\n2027 with the Lucy spacecraft flyby should allow significant insight into\ncollisional processes among what appear to be the icy bodies of the Trojan\nbelt.",

Our aim is the validation\nof these measurements to support future studies of the Sun's AM loss. Methods:\nWe combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and the magnetic field\nmeasured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard\nSolar Orbiter. We calculate the AM flux per solid-angle element using data from\nthe first orbit of the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the\ncontributions from protons and from magnetic stresses to the total AM flux.\nResults: The AM flux varies significantly over time. The particle contribution\ntypically dominates over the magnetic-field contribution during our measurement\ninterval. The total AM flux shows the largest variation and is typically\nanti-correlated with the radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression\nregion, potentially associated with a co-rotating interaction region or a\ncoronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in the AM\nflux, yet without a significant increase in the AM per unit mass. We repeat our\nanalysis using the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW)\ninstrument. Using this independent method, we find a decrease in the peaks of\npositive AM flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions: Our results\nlargely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind AM flux in terms of\namplitude, variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our\nanalysis highlights the potential for future, more detailed, studies of the\nsolar wind's AM and its other large-scale properties with data from Solar\nOrbiter. We emphasise the need to study the radial evolution and latitudinal\ndependence of the AM flux in combination with data from Parker Solar Probe and\nassets at heliocentric distances of 1 au and beyond.",

To enhance the scientific outputs of the mission, the Science\nOperations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the instrument teams and\nthe Mission Operations Team.

As the first step, lessons on the science operations learned from\npast Japanese X-ray missions are reviewed, and 15 kinds of lessons are\nidentified. Among them, a) the importance of early preparation of the\noperations from the ground stage, b) construction of an independent team for\nscience operations separate from the instrument development, and c) operations\nwith well-defined duties by appointed members are recognized as key lessons.\nThen, the team structure and the task division between the mission and science\noperations are defined; the tasks are shared among Japan, US, and Europe and\nare performed by three centers, the SOC, SDC, and ESAC, respectively. The SOC\nis designed to perform tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as\nspacecraft planning, quick-look health checks, pre-pipeline processing, etc.,\nand the SDC covers tasks regarding data calibration processing, maintenance of\nanalysis tools, etc. The data-archive and user-support activities are covered\nboth by the SOC and SDC.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission presents a unique opportunity to study\nthe near-Sun solar wind closer than any previous spacecraft. During its fourth\nand fifth solar encounters, PSP had the same orbital trajectory, meaning that\nsolar wind was measured at the same latitudes and radial distances. We identify\ntwo streams measured at the same heliocentric distance ($\\sim$0.13au) and\nlatitude ($\\sim$-3.5$^{\\circ}$) across these encounters to reduce spatial\nevolution effects. By comparing the plasma of each stream, we confirm that they\nare not dominated by variable transient events, despite PSP's proximity to the\nheliospheric current sheet. Both streams are consistent with a previous slow\nAlfv\u00e9nic solar wind study once radial effects are considered, and appear to\noriginate at the Southern polar coronal hole boundary. We also show that the\nswitchback properties are not distinctly different between these two streams.\nLow $\\alpha$-particle abundance ($\\sim$ 0.6 %) is observed in the encounter 5\nstream, suggesting that some physical mechanism must act on coronal hole\nboundary wind to cause $\\alpha$-particle depletion. Possible explanations for\nour observations are discussed, but it remains unclear whether the depletion\noccurs during the release or the acceleration of the wind. Using a flux tube\nargument, we note that an $\\alpha$-particle abundance of $\\sim$ 0.6 % in this\nlow velocity wind could correspond to an abundance of $\\sim$ 0.9 % at 1 au.\nFinally, as the two streams roughly correspond to the spatial extent of a\nswitchback patch, we suggest that patches are distinct features of coronal hole\nwind.",

This paper shows how the controller\ndemonstration is carried out by having the spacecraft follow a desired path,\nspecified in the referenced model. Increases can be made by examining the route\nused to construct a DNN and understanding the effects of various activating\nfunctions on system efficiency. The obstacle avoidance algorithm is built into\nthe control features to respond spontaneously using inputs from the neural\nnetwork for collision avoidance while optimizing the modified trajectory. The\naction of a neural network to control the adaptive nature of the nonlinear\nmechanisms in the controller will make the control system capable of handling\nmultiple nonlinear events and also uncertainties that have not been induced in\nthe control algorithm. Multiple algorithms for optimizing flight controls and\nfuel consumption can be implemented using knowledge of flight dynamics in\ntrajectory and also in the event of obstacle avoidance. This paper also\nexplains how a DNN can learn to control the flight path and make the system\nmore reliable with each launch, thereby improving the chances of predicting\ncollisions of space objects. The data released from this research is used to\ndesign more advanced DNN model capable of predicting other orbital events as\nwell.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Features of the response of pickup ions (PUIs) to the Kelvin--Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) on the heliopause (HP) are examined by means of\ntwo-dimensional hybrid simulations. We assume the supersonic neutral solar wind\nas the source of PUIs gyrating about the magnetic field in the outer\nheliosheath. These PUIs become energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) via charge\nexchange with interstellar hydrogen, and a portion of these ENAs are detected\nby spacecraft such as the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX}. To evaluate\nthe possibility of identifying the KHI on HP from ENA observations, we assume\nthat an imprint of the KHI may be displayed in spatial and temporal variations\nin the observed ENA profile. As an alternative to ENA, the column density of\nPUIs integrated across the HP is calculated. The KH-inducing vortex forces not\nonly background protons but also PUIs to roll up deep in the inner heliosheath.\nThe KH vortex also results in the emission of magnetosonic pulses that sweep\nPUIs in the outer heliosheath and lead to their local confinement. These\neffects elongate the PUIs spatial distribution in the direction normal to the\nHP. The appearance of the local confined structure in the PUIs column density\nis consequently confirmed, and this feature can be confirmed as the KHI\nevolution. Although the simulation cannot be quantitatively compared with the\nobservations currently available because its resolution is too small, we expect\nthat the derived properties will be useful for diagnosing the nature of HP\nfluctuation in future missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a manifestation of the Sun's eruptive\nnature. They can have a great impact on Earth, but also on human activity in\nspace and on the ground. Therefore, modelling their evolution as they propagate\nthrough interplanetary space is essential. EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting\nInformation Asset (EUHFORIA) is a data-driven, physics-based model, tracing the\nevolution of CMEs through background solar wind conditions. It employs a\nspheromak flux rope, which provides it with the advantage of reconstructing the\ninternal magnetic field configuration of CMEs. This is something that is not\nincluded in the simpler cone CME model used so far for space weather\nforecasting. This work aims at assessing the spheromak CME model included in\nEUHFORIA. We employed the spheromak CME model to reconstruct a well observed\nCME and compare model output to in situ observations. We focus on an eruption\nfrom 6 January 2013 encountered by two radially aligned spacecraft, Venus\nExpress and STEREO-A. We first analysed the observed properties of the source\nof this CME eruption and we extracted the CME properties as it lifted off from\nthe Sun. Using this information, we set up EUHFORIA runs to model the event.\nThe model predicts arrival times from half to a full day ahead of the in situ\nobserved ones, but within errors established from similar studies. In the\nmodelling domain, the CME appears to be propagating primarily southward, which\nis in accordance with white-light images of the CME eruption close to the Sun.\nIn order to get the observed magnetic field topology, we aimed at selecting a\nspheromak rotation angle for which the axis of symmetry of the spheromak is\nperpendicular to the direction of the polarity inversion line (PIL). The\nmodelled magnetic field profiles, their amplitude, arrival times, and sheath\nregion length are all affected by the choice of radius of the modelled\nspheromak.",
