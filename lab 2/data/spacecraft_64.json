If this acceleration\nrepresents a departure from Newtonian gravity or is indicative of an additional\nmass distribution in the outer solar system, it should be detectable in the\norbits of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs).

Three different methods of spectral estimation are\nconsidered: (i) the spherical analogue of the one-dimensional (1-D)\nperiodogram, (ii) the maximum likelihood method, and (iii) a spherical analogue\nof the 1-D multitaper method. The periodogram exhibits strong spectral leakage,\nespecially for small regions of area $A\\ll 4\\pi$, and is generally unsuitable\nfor spherical spectral analysis applications, just as it is in 1-D. The maximum\nlikelihood method is particularly useful in the case of nearly-whole-sphere\ncoverage, $A\\approx 4\\pi$, and has been widely used in cosmology to estimate\nthe spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation from spacecraft\nobservations. The spherical multitaper method affords easy control over the\nfundamental trade-off between spectral resolution and variance, and is easily\nimplemented regardless of the region size, requiring neither non-linear\niteration nor large-scale matrix inversion. As a result, the method is ideally\nsuited for most applications in geophysics, geodesy or planetary science, where\nthe objective is to obtain a spatially localized estimate of the spectrum of a\nsignal from noisy data within a pre-selected and typically small region.",

It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., the\nvacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in general\nrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black\nhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild\ncase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior\ninside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that\nthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new\ntype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to\nexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small\nobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric\nmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows for\nmodifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physical\neffects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of the\nsource, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmological\nconstants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshift\nfactor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effects\ncan be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the acceleration\nof the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxies\nand other astrophysical objects. The third effect can be used to propose a\nnon-cosmological explanation of high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts.",

The predicted charging rates range from 2840 to 64300\n+e/s, at peak intensity, for the 4 largest SEP events in September and October\n1989.

More precisely,\nthese missions will enable us to test relativistic gravity to\n$10^{-7}-10^{-9}$, and will require 2nd post-Newtonian approximation of\nrelevant theories of gravity.

These flares are thought to be indicative of\nlate time activity by the central engine that powers the GRB and produced by\nmeans similar to those which produce the prompt emission. We use a\nnon-parametric procedure to study the overall temporal properties of the flares\nand a structure function analysis to look for an evolution of the fundamental\nvariability time-scale between the prompt and late time emission. We find a\nstrong correlation in 28 individual x-ray flares in 18 separate GRBs between\nthe flare duration and their time of peak flux since the GRB trigger. We also\nfind a qualitative trend of decreasing variability as a function of time since\ntrigger, with a characteristic minimum variability timescale $\\Delta t/t=0.1$\nfor most flares. We interpret these results as evidence of internal shocks at\ncollision radii that are larger than those that produced the prompt emission.\nContemporaneous detections of high energy emission by GLAST could be a crucial\ntest in determining if indeed these X-ray flares originate as internal shocks\nbehind the afterglow, as any X-ray emission originating from behind the\nafterglow is expected to undergo inverse Compton scattering as it passes\nthrough the external shock.",

This space-based solar x-ray and gamma-ray telescope has much greater\nsensitivity than previous experiments in the 3-25 keV range, but is normally\nnot well suited to detecting extended sources since their signal is not\nmodulated by RHESSI's rotating grids. When the spacecraft is offpointed from\nthe target source, however, the fan-beam modulation time-modulates the\ntransmission by shadowing resulting from exploiting the finite thickness of the\ngrids. In this paper we detail how the technique is implemented and verify its\nconsistency with sources with clear known signals that have occurred during\nRHESSI offpointing: microflares and the Crab Nebula. In both cases the results\nare consistent with previous and complementary measurements. Preliminary work\nindicates that this new technique allows RHESSI to observe the integrated hard\nx-ray spectrum of weak extended sources on the quiet Sun.",

Here\nwe revisit this topic by analysing continuum images of more than 160 sunspots\nobserved by the MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft for the period\nbetween 1998 March to 2004 March, i.e. a sizable part of solar cycle 23. The\nadvantage of this data set is its homogeneity, with no seeing fluctuations. A\ncareful stray light correction, which is validated using the Mercury transit of\n7th May, 2003, is carried out before the umbral and penumbral intensities are\ndetermined. The influence of the Zeeman splitting of the nearby NiI spectral\nline on the measured 'continuum' intensity is also taken into account. We did\nnot observe any significant variation in umbral core, mean umbral and mean\npenumbral intensities with solar cycle, which is in contrast to earlier\nfindings for the umbral core intensity. We do find a strong and clear\ndependence of the umbral brightness on sunspot size, however. The penumbral\nbrightness also displays a weak dependence. The brightness-radius relationship\nhas numerous implications, some of which, such as those for the energy\ntransport in umbrae, are pointed out.",

This\ninstrument provides data for many heavy ions not previously available for\ndetailed study, such as Oxygen (O6+, O7+), Carbon (C5+, C6+), and Iron (Fe10+).\nThe ion heating is found to depend critically on the upstream plasma",

An\nimportant aim of the STEREO mission is to get a 3D view of the solar corona.\nWe develop a program for the stereoscopic reconstruction of\n3D coronal loops from images taken with the two STEREO spacecraft.\nA pure geometric triangulation of coronal features leads to ambiguities\nbecause the dilute plasma emissions complicates the association of features in\nimage 1 with features in image 2. As a consequence of these problems the\nstereoscopic reconstruction is not unique and multiple solutions occur.\nWe demonstrate how these ambiguities can be resolved with the help of\ndifferent coronal magnetic field models (potential, linear and non-linear\nforce-free fields). The idea is that, due to the high conductivity in the\ncoronal plasma, the emitting plasma outlines the magnetic field lines.\nConsequently the 3D coronal magnetic field provides a proxy for the\nstereoscopy which allows to eliminate inconsistent configurations.\nThe combination of stereoscopy and magnetic modelling is more powerful than\none of these tools alone. We test our method with the help of a model active\nregion and plan to apply it to the solar case as soon as\nSTEREO data become available.",

A scalar potential model\n(SPM) that derived from considerations of galaxy clusters, of redshift, and of\nH{\\scriptsize{I}} rotation curves of spiral galaxies is applied to the Pioneer\nAnomaly. Matter is posited to warp the scalar potential $\\rho$ field. The\nchanging $\\rho$ field along the light path causes the Pioneer Anomaly. The SPM\nis consistent with the general value of $a_\\mathrm{P}$; with the annual\nperiodicity; with the differing $a_\\mathrm{P}$ between the spacecraft; with the\ndiscrepancy between {\\textit{Sigma}} and CHASMP programs at P10 (I) and their\ncloser agreement at P10 (III); with the slowly declining $a_\\mathrm{P}$; with\nthe low value of $a_\\mathrm{P}$ immediately before the P11's Saturn encounter;\nwith the high uncertainty in the value of $a_\\mathrm{P}$ obtained during and\nafter the P11's Saturn encounter; and with the cosmological connection\nsuggested by $a_\\mathrm{P} \\approx cH_\\mathrm{o}$. The effect of the $\\rho$\nfield warp appears as the curvature of space proposed by general relativity\n(GR). The Hubble Law and $a_\\mathrm{P} \\approx cH_\\mathrm{o}$ are\nmanifestations of the Newtonian spherical property. Therefore, gravitational\nattraction, the equivalence principle, and the planet ephemeris remain as\ndescribed by GR. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the Sources\nand Sinks may be replaced by a flat and static $\\rho$ field such as between\ncluster cells and on the Solar System scale at a relatively large distance from\na Source or Sink.",

The SOXS Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed, and\nfabricated by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with the\nSpace Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC),\nBangalore of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The energy ranges of\nthe Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4 - 25 keV and 4 - 56 keV respectively. The Si\nPIN provides sub-keV energy resolution while the CZT reveals ~1.7 keV energy\nresolution throughout the energy range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy\nresolution of the Si PIN detector allows measuring the intensity, peak energy,\nand the equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a\nfunction of time in all ten M-class flares studied in this investigation. The\npeak energy (Ep) of the Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.7 keV with\nincreasing in temperature from 9 to 58 MK. We found that the equivalent width\n(w) of the Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 30 MK\nand then increases very slowly up to 40 Mk. It remains between 3.5 and 4 keV in\nthe temperature range of 30 - 45 MK. We compare our measurements of w with\ncalculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these\nmeasurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both\nEp and w with temperature as due to the changes in the ionization and\nrecombination conditions in the plasma during the flare interval and as a\nconsequence the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.",

The\ncharacterization utilizes the 36 auto/cross correlations of the 3+3 complex\nCartesian components of the electric and magnetic fields; hence, they are\nsecond order in the field strengths and so have physical dimension energy\ndensity. Although such 6x6 correlation matrices have been successfully employed\non previous space missions, they are not physical quantities; because they are\nnot manifestly space-time tensors. In this paper we propose a systematic\nrepresentation of the 36 degrees-of-freedom of partially coherent\nelectromagnetic fields as a set of manifestly covariant space-time tensors,\nwhich we call the Canonical Electromagnetic Observables (CEO). As an example,\nwe apply this formalism to analyze real data from a chorus emission in the\nmid-latitude magnetosphere, as registered by the STAFF-SA instrument on board\nthe Cluster-II spacecraft. We find that the CEO analysis increases the amount\nof information that can be extracted from the STAFF-SA dataset; for instance,\nthe reactive energy flux density, which is one of the CEO parameters,\nidentifies the source region of electromagnetic emissions more directly than\nthe active energy (Poynting) flux density alone.",

According to such a proposal, the secular part of the anomalous\nacceleration experienced by the twin spacecraft of about 1 nm s^-2 could be\ncaused by an extra-potential \\delta\\Phi_P=c^2\\chi r^2, with \\chi=4 10^-8 AU^-2,\ncoming from the second sector of the considered model.

As for other previously proposed non-conventional\ngravitational explanations of the Pioneer anomaly, the answer of the latest\nobservational determinations of the residual perihelion rates by RAS IAA is\nneatly and unambiguously negative. The presence of another possible candidate\nto explain the Pioneer anomaly, i.e. the extra-potential \\delta\\Phi_N, linear\nin distance, from the first sector of the Jaekel and Reynaud model, is ruled\nout not only by the residuals of the optical data of the outer planets\nprocessed with the recent RAS IAA EPM2004 ephemerides but also by those\nproduced with other, older dynamical theories like, e.g., the well known NASA\nJPL DE200.",

Due to the expansion of the universe the wavelength of an unbound\nparticle would increase according to its cosmological redshift. Based on the\nnavigation anomalies of the Pioneer 10 & 11 spacecraft it is postulated that an\nunbound massive particle has a cosmological redshift z = (c / v_0) H_0 t, where\nc is the speed of light in vacuum, v_0 is the initial velocity of the particle,\nH_0 is Hubble's constant and t is the duration of time that the particle has\nbeen unbound. The increase in wavelength of the particle corresponds to a\ndecrease in its speed by delta_v = - c H_0 t. Furthermore, it is hypothesized\nthat the solar system has escaped the gravity of the Galaxy as evidenced by its\norbital speed and radial distance and by the visible mass within the solar\nsystem radius. This means that spacecraft which become unbound to the solar\nsystem would also be galactically unbound and subject to the Hubble law. This\nhypothesis and the extended Hubble law may explain the anomalous acceleration\nfound to be acting upon the unbound Pioneer 10 & 11 spacecraft. Thus, the\nPioneer anomaly may be a counter example to the dark matter hypothesis.\nBecause photons have a speed which make them unbound to the Galaxy, it is\npredicted that the navigation beam in open space would undergo a cosmological\nredshift in its frequency which would be detectable with modern clocks.",

The EXIST mission will make use of 6 square meters of 0.5\ncm thick CZT detectors to record cosmic X-rays in the energy range from 10 keV\nto 600 keV. The detectors will be shielded by a fully or partly active shield.\nFor the specific detector and shielding geometry considered here and an orbit\nwith a low (7 deg) inclination, the background rate is dominated by the diffuse\nextragalactic below 200 keV. Prompt and delayed hadronic backgrounds grow\nincreasingly important above this energy, becoming the main contributors to the\ntotal background above 1 MeV.
