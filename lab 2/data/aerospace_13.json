    "abstract": "Abstract:  In response to the interest to re-use Palapa B2R satellite nearing its End of\nLife (EOL) time, an idea to incline the satellite orbit in order to cover a new\nregion has emerged in the recent years. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, Palapa\nB2R has to be stabilized against its internal energy dissipation effect. This\nwork is focused on analyzing the dynamics of the reusable satellite in its\ninclined orbit. The study discusses in particular the stability of the prolate\ndual-spin satellite under the effect of perturbed field of gravitation due to\nthe inclination of its elliptical orbit. Palapa B2R physical data was\nsubstituted into the dual-spin's equation of motion. The coefficient of zonal\nharmonics J2 was induced into the gravity-gradient moment term that affects the\nsatellite attitude. The satellite's motion and attitude were then simulated in\nthe perturbed gravitational field by J2, with the variation of orbit's\neccentricity and inclination. The analysis of the satellite dynamics and its\nstability was conducted for designing a control system for the vehicle in its\nnew inclined orbit.",

When the plasma is rarefied (has a small density), the heat flow to\nthe AB reflector is not large and the temperature in the triple reflector net\nis lower than 2000 - 3000 K. This offered AB-reactor has significantly less\npower then the currently contemplated power reactors with magnetic or inertial\nconfinement (hundreds-thousands of kW, not millions of kW).

As\nexpected, experimental results show a large effect of the contact roughness on\nthe crack nucleation conditions. Rationalisation of the crack nucleation\nboundary independently of the studied roughnesses was successfully obtained by\nintroducing the concept of effective contact area. This does show that the\nfretting crack nucleation of the studied material can be efficiently described\nby the local effective loadings inside the contact.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Time-averaged series of granulation images are analysed using COLIBRI, a\npurpose-adapted version of a code originally developed to detect straight or\ncurvilinear features in aerospace images. The algorithm of image processing\nutilises a nonparametric statistical criterion that identifies a straight-line\nsegment as a linear feature (lineament) if the photospheric brightness at a\ncertain distance from this line is on both sides stochastically lower or higher\nthan at the line itself. Curvilinear features can be detected as chains of\nlineaments, using a criterion modified in some way. Once the input parameters\nused by the algorithm are properly adjusted, the algorithm highlights\n``ridges'' and ``trenches'' in the relief of the brightness field, drawing\nwhite and dark lanes. The most remarkable property of the trenching patterns is\na nearly-universally-present parallelism of ridges and trenches. Since the\nmaterial upflows are brighter than the downflows, the alternating parallel\nlight and dark lanes should reflect the presence of roll convection in the\nsubphotospheric layers. If the numerous images processed by us are\nrepresentative, the patterns revealed suggest a widespread occurrence of roll\nconvection in the outer solar convection zone. In particular, the roll systems\ncould form the fine structure of larger-scale, supergranular and/or\nmesogranular convection flows. Granules appear to be overheated blobs of\nmaterial that could develop in convection rolls due to some instabilities of\nroll motion.",

In\nthis paper, we therefore present slightly different modifications to include\nmolecule mass diffusion fully in the Navier-Stokes equations. These\nmodifications are shown to be stable and produce physical solutions to the\nshock problem of a quality broadly similar to those from the family of extended\nhydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. The modifications\nprimarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at\nleast as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the\nnumerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics\nmodels, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We recommend further\ninvestigation and testing on a number of different benchmark non-equilibrium\nflow cases.",

Then, three important theorems for fluid dynamics are deduced. These\ntheorems are (1) Potential flow (inviscid and irrotational) is stable. (2)\nInviscid rotational (nonzero vorticity) flow is unstable. (3) Velocity profile\nwith an inflectional point is unstable when there is no work input or output to\nthe system, for both inviscid and viscous flows. These theorems are, for the\nfirst time, deduced, and are of great significance for the understanding of\ngeneration of turbulence and the explanation of complex flows.\nFrom these results, it is concluded that the classical Rayleigh theorem\n(1880) on inflectional velocity instability of inviscid flows is incorrect\nwhich has last for more than a century. It is demonstrated that existence of\ninflection point on velocity profile is a sufficient condition, but not a\nnecessary condition for flow instability, for both inviscid and viscous flows.\nThe paradox of dual role of viscosity has been resolved: viscosity has only\nstable role. Why the paradox appeared is due to that the Rayleigh Theorem of\ninviscid flows by linear analysis is incorrect.",

New evidence is presented for the existence\nof long-lived, quasi-regular structures (first reported by Getling and Brandt\n(2002)), which no longer appear unusual in images averaged over 1--2-h time\nintervals. Such structures appear as families of light and dark concentric\nrings or families of light and dark parallel strips (``ridges'' and\n``trenches'' in the brightness distributions). In some cases, rings are\ncombined with radial ``spokes'' and can thus form ``web'' patterns. The\ncharacteristic width of a ridge or trench is somewhat larger than the typical\nsize of granules. Running-average movies constructed from the series of images\nare used to seek such structures. An algorithm is developed to obtain, for\nautomatically selected centres, the radial distributions of the azimuthally\naveraged intensity, which highlight the concentric-ring patterns. We also\npresent a time-averaged granulation image processed with a software package\nintended for the detection of geological structures in aerospace images. A\ntechnique of running-average-based correlations between the brightness\nvariations at various points of the granular field is developed and indications\nare found for a dynamical link between the emergence and sinking of hot and\ncool parcels of the solar plasma. In particular, such a correlation analysis\nconfirms our suggestion that granules -- overheated blobs -- may repeatedly\nemerge on the solar surface. Based on our study, the critical remarks by Rast\n(2002) on the original paper by Getling and Brandt (2002) can be dismissed.",

The fits include small\nnonspherical grains of amorphous silicates (pyroxene and olivine), crystalline\nsilicates (forsterite and pyroxene), and quartz, together with large fluffy\namorphous silicate grains. A wide range in the fraction of crystalline silicate\ngrains as well as large silicate grains among these stars are found. The dust\nin the transitional-disk objects CoKu Tau/4, GM Aur, and DM Tau has the\nsimplest form of silicates, with almost no hint of crystalline components and\nmodest amounts of large grains. This indicates that the dust grains in these\nobjects have been modified little from their origin in the interstellar medium.\nOther stars show various amounts of crystalline silicates, similar to the wide\ndispersion of the degree of crystallinity reported for Herbig Ae/Be stars of\nmass <2.5 solar masses. Late spectral type, low-mass stars can have significant\nfractions of crystalline silicate grains. Higher quartz mass fractions often\naccompany low amorphous olivine-to-amorphous pyroxene ratios. It is also found\nthat lower contrast of the 10 micron feature accompanies greater crystallinity.",

The variational formulation employed seeks to achieve the best\nagreement between the model prediction and some measured parameters in the\nsense of a minimum of a functional given by a sum over the entire set of\nmeasurements. The advantage of this approach lies in its flexibility: different\nsets of measurements and information about different components of the\nstress-strain state can be incorporated. We demonstrate the power of the\ntechnique by analysing experimental data for welds in thin sheet of a nickel\nsuperalloy aerospace material. Very good agreement can be achieved between the\nprediction and the measurement results without the necessity of using iterative\nsolution. In practice complete characterisation of residual stress states is\noften very difficult, due to limitations of facility access, measurement time\nor specimen dimensions. Implications of the new technique for experimental\nanalysis are all the more significant, since it allows the reconstruction of\nthe entire stress state from incomplete sets of data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The ratio between the proton and electron masses is shown to be close to the\nratio between the strong and electromagnetic interaction coupling constants at\nExtremely Low Energy (ELE). Based on the experimental data, this relation has\nbeen extended for the weak and gravitational interactions, too. Thus, a mass\nrelation has been found, according to which the rest mass of the Lightest Free\nMassive Stable Particle (LFMSP), acted upon by a particular interaction, is\nproportional to the coupling constant of the respective interaction at ELE. On\nthe basis of this mass relation, the electron neutrino and graviton masses have\nbeen approximately estimated to 2.1x10^(-4) eV/c^2 and 2.3x10^(-34) eV/c^2,\nrespectively. The last value is of the order of the magnitude of hbar*H/c^2,\nwhere H is the Hubble constant and hbar is the reduced Planck constant. It is\nworth noting that this value has been obtained by fundamental constants only,\nwithout consideration of any cosmological models.",

It will be\nused chiefly to test the feasibility of using a large-format detector array at\nthe image plane of the sky to obtain wide-field interferometry images through\nmosaicing techniques. In this setup each detector pixel records interferograms\ncorresponding to averaging a particular pointing range on the sky as the\noptical path length is scanned and as the baseline separation and orientation\nis varied. The final image is constructed through spatial and spectral Fourier\ntransforms of the recorded interferograms for each pixel, followed by a\nmosaic/joint-deconvolution procedure of all the pixels. In this manner the\nimage within the pointing range of each detector pixel is further resolved to\nan angular resolution corresponding to the maximum baseline separation for\nfringe measurements.\nWe present the motivation for building the testbed, show the optical,\nmechanical, control, and data system design, and describe the image processing\nrequirements and algorithms.
