    "abstract": "Abstract:  The application of directed energy to spacecraft mission design is explored\nusing rapid transit to Mars as the design objective. An Earth-based laser array\nof unprecedented size (10~m diameter) and power (100~MW) is assumed to be\nenabled by ongoing developments in photonic laser technology. A phased-array\nlaser of this size and incorporating atmospheric compensation would be able to\ndeliver laser power to spacecraft in cislunar space, where the incident laser\nis focused into a hydrogen heating chamber via an inflatable reflector. The\nhydrogen propellant is then exhausted through a nozzle to realize specific\nimpulses of 3000 s. The architecture is shown to be immediately reusable via a\nburn-back maneuver to return the propulsion unit while still within range of\nthe Earth-based laser. The ability to tolerate much greater laser fluxes\nenables realizing the combination of high thrust and high specific impulse,\nmaking this approach favorable in comparison to laser-electric propulsion and\noccupying a parameter space similar to gas-core nuclear thermal rockets\n(without the requisite reactor). The heating chamber and its associated\nregenerative cooling and propellant handling systems are crucial elements of\nthe design that receive special attention in this study. The astrodynamics and\nthe extreme aerocapture maneuver required at Mars arrival after a 45-day\ntransit are also analyzed in detail. The application of laser-thermal\npropulsion as an enabling technology for other rapid transit missions in the\nsolar system and beyond is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic reconnection has been suggested to play an important role in the\ndynamics and energetics of plasma turbulence by spacecraft observations,\nsimulations and theory over the past two decades, and recently, by\nmagnetosheath observations of MMS. A new method based on magnetic flux\ntransport (MFT) has been developed to identify reconnection activity in\nturbulent plasmas. This method is applied to a gyrokinetic simulation of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) plasma turbulence. Results on the identification of three\nactive reconnection X-points are reported. The first two X-points have\ndeveloped bi-directional electron outflow jets. Beyond the category of\nelectron-only reconnection, the third X-point does not have bi-directional\nelectron outflow jets because the flow is modified by turbulence. In all cases,\nthis method successfully identifies active reconnection through clear inward\nand outward flux transport around the X-points. This transport pattern defines\nreconnection and produces a new quadrupolar structure in the divergence of MFT.\nThis method is expected to be applicable to spacecraft missions such as MMS,\nParker Solar Probe, and Solar Orbiter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Understanding the geological modification processes on asteroids can provide\ninformation concerning their surface history. Images of small asteroids from\nspacecraft show a depletion in terms of smaller craters. Seismic shaking was\nconsidered to be responsible for crater erasure and the main driver modifying\nthe geology of asteroids via regolith convection or the Brazil nut effect.\nHowever, a recent artificial impact experiment on the asteroid Ryugu by the\nJapanese Hayabusa2 mission revealed minimal seismic activity. To investigate\nwhether a seismic shaking model can reproduce the observed crater record, the\ncrater distribution on Ryugu was analyzed using crater production functions\nunder cohesionless conditions. Crater retention ages were estimated as a\nfunction of crater diameter for Ryugu, Itokawa, Eros, and Bennu using the\ncrater size-frequency distribution and crater production function estimated for\nthose asteroids. We found that the power-law indices \"a\" are inconsistent with\ndiffusion processes (e.g., seismic shaking, a=2). This result suggests that\nseismic shaking models based on diffusion equations cannot explain the crater\ndistribution on small asteroids. Alternative processes include surface flows,\npossibly at the origin of geomorphological and spectral features of Ryugu. We\ndemonstrate that the vertical mixing of material at depths shallower than 1 m\noccurs over 10^3-10^5 yr by cratering and obliteration. The young surface age\nof Ryugu is consistent with the slow space weathering that results from\ncratering, as suggested in previous studies. The timescale (10^4-10^6 yr)\nrequired for resurfacing at depths of 2-4 m can be compared with the cosmic-ray\nexposure ages of returned samples to constrain the distribution of impactors\nthat collide with Ryugu.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Large scale directed energy offers the possibility of radical transformation\nin a variety of areas, including the ability to achieve relativistic flight\nthat will enable the first interstellar missions, as well as rapid\ninterplanetary transit. In addition, the same technology will allow for\nlong-range beamed power for ion, ablation, and thermal engines, as well as\nlong-range recharging of distant spacecraft, long-range and ultra high\nbandwidth laser communications, and many additional applications that include\nremote composition analysis, manipulation of asteroids, and full planetary\ndefense. Directed energy relies on photonics which, like electronics, is an\nexponentially expanding growth area driven by diverse economic interests that\nallows transformational advances in space exploration and capability. We have\nmade enormous technological progress in the last few years to enable this\nlong-term vision. In addition to the technological challenges, we must face the\neconomic challenges to bring the vision to reality. The path ahead requires a\nfundamental change in the system designs to allow for the radical cost\nreductions required. To afford the full-scale realization of this vision we\nwill need to bring to fore integrated photonics and mass production as a path\nforward. Fortunately, integrated photonics is a technology driven by vast\nconsumer need for high speed data delivery. We outline the fundamental physics\nthat drive the economics and derive an analytic cost model that allows us to\nlogically plan the path ahead.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Accurate and stable spacecraft pointing is a requirement of many astronomical\nobservations. Pointing particularly challenges nanosatellites because of an\nunfavorable surface area to mass ratio and proportionally large volume required\nfor even the smallest attitude control systems. This work explores the\nlimitations on astrophysical attitude knowledge and control in a regime\nunrestricted by actuator precision or actuator-induced disturbances such as\njitter. The external disturbances on an archetypal 6U CubeSat are modeled and\nthe limiting sensing knowledge is calculated from the available stellar flux\nand grasp of a telescope within the available volume. These inputs are\nintegrated using a model-predictive control scheme. For a simple test case at 1\nHz, with an 85 mm telescope and a single 11th magnitude star, the achievable\nbody pointing is predicted to be 0.39 arcseconds. For a more general limit,\nintegrating available star light, the achievable attitude sensing is\napproximately 1 milliarcsecond, which leads to a predicted body pointing\naccuracy of 20 milliarcseconds after application of the control model. These\nresults show significant room for attitude sensing and control systems to\nimprove before astrophysical and environmental limits are reached.",

LISA will operate laser\ninterferometers between three spacecrafts. Each spacecraft will utilize\nindependent clocks which determine the sampling times of onboard phasemeters to\nextract the interferometric phases and, ultimately, gravitational wave signals.\nTo suppress limiting laser frequency noise, signals sampled by each phasemeter\nneed to be combined in post-processing to synthesize virtual equal-arm\ninterferometers. The synthesis in turn requires a synchronization of the\nindependent clocks. This article reports on the experimental verification of a\nclock synchronization scheme down to LISA performance levels using a hexagonal\noptical bench. The development of the scheme includes data processing that is\nexpected to be applicable to the real LISA data with minor modifications.\nAdditionally, some noise coupling mechanisms are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space biology research aims to understand fundamental effects of spaceflight\non organisms, develop foundational knowledge to support deep space exploration,\nand ultimately bioengineer spacecraft and habitats to stabilize the ecosystem\nof plants, crops, microbes, animals, and humans for sustained multi-planetary\nlife. To advance these aims, the field leverages experiments, platforms, data,\nand model organisms from both spaceborne and ground-analog studies. As research\nis extended beyond low Earth orbit, experiments and platforms must be maximally\nautonomous, light, agile, and intelligent to expedite knowledge discovery. Here\nwe present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning, and modeling applications which offer key solutions toward\nthese space biology challenges. In the next decade, the synthesis of artificial\nintelligence into the field of space biology will deepen the biological\nunderstanding of spaceflight effects, facilitate predictive modeling and\nanalytics, support maximally autonomous and reproducible experiments, and\nefficiently manage spaceborne data and metadata, all with the goal to enable\nlife to thrive in deep space.",

To effectively mitigate myriad space health\nhazards, paradigm shifts in data and space health systems are necessary to\nenable Earth-independence, rather than Earth-reliance. Promising developments\nin the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning for biology and\nhealth can address these needs. We propose an appropriately autonomous and\nintelligent Precision Space Health system that will monitor, aggregate, and\nassess biomedical statuses; analyze and predict personalized adverse health\noutcomes; adapt and respond to newly accumulated data; and provide preventive,\nactionable, and timely insights to individual deep space crew members and\niterative decision support to their crew medical officer. Here we present a\nsummary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration, on future applications of artificial\nintelligence in space biology and health. In the next decade, biomonitoring\ntechnology, biomarker science, spacecraft hardware, intelligent software, and\nstreamlined data management must mature and be woven together into a Precision\nSpace Health system to enable humanity to thrive in deep space.",

Studying Sedna from a close distance can provide unique\ndata about the Solar System evolution process including protoplanetary disc and\nrelated mechanisms. The trajectories to Sedna are determined considering flight\ntime and the total characteristic velocity (${\\Delta}V$) constraints. The time\nof flight for the analysis was limited to 20 years. The direct flight, the use\nof gravity assist manoeuvres near Venus, the Earth and the giant planets\nJupiter and Neptune, and the flight with the Oberth manoeuvre near the Sun are\nconsidered. It is demonstrated that the use of flight scheme with\n${\\Delta}VEGA$ (${\\Delta}V$ and Earth Gravity Assist manoeuvre) and\nJupiter-Neptune gravity assist leads to the lowest cost of ${\\Delta}V$=6.13\nkm/s for launch in 2041. The maximum payload for schemes with ${\\Delta}$VEGA\nmanoeuvre is 500 kg using Soyuz 2.1.b, 2,000 kg using Proton-M and Delta IV\nHeavy and exceeds $12,000$ kg using SLS. For schemes with only Jupiter gravity\nassist, payload mass is twice less than for ones with ${\\Delta}$VEGA manoeuvre.\nAs a possible expansion of the mission to Sedna, it is proposed to send a small\nspacecraft to another TNO during the primary flight to Sedna. Five TNOs\nsuitable for this scenario are found, three extreme TNOs 2012 VP113, (541132)\nLele\u0101k\u016bhonua (former 2015 TG387), 2013 SY99) and two classical Kuiper Belt\nobjects: (90482) Orcus, (20000) Varuna.",

At the same time,\nradio-science instrumentation has reached an unprecedented level of accuracy,\nleading to a significant improvement of our knowledge of celestial bodies.\nAlong with this hardware upgrade, software products for interplanetary missions\nhave been greatly refined. In this context, we introduce Orbit14, a precise\norbit determination software developed at the University of Pisa for processing\nthe radio-science data of the BepiColombo and Juno missions. Along the years,\nmany tools have been implemented into the software and Orbit14 capitalized the\nexperience coming from simulations and treatment of real data. In this paper,\nwe present a review of orbit determination methods developed at the University\nof Pisa for radio-science experiments of interplanetary missions. We describe\nthe basic theory of the process of parameters estimation and refined methods\nnecessary to have full control on experiments involving spacecraft orbiting\nmillions of kilometers far from the Earth. Our aim is to give both an extensive\ndescription of the treatment of radio-science experiments and step-to-step\ninstructions for those who are approaching the field of orbit determination in\nthe context of space missions. We show also the work conducted on the Juno and\nBepiColombo missions by means of the Orbit14 software.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Accurate gravity field models are essential for safe proximity operations\naround small bodies. State-of-the-art techniques use spherical harmonics or\nhigh-fidelity polyhedron shape models. Unfortunately, these techniques can\nbecome inaccurate near the surface of the small body or have high computational\ncosts, especially for binary or heterogeneous small bodies. New learning-based\ntechniques do not encode a predefined structure and are more versatile. In\nexchange for versatility, learning-based techniques can be less robust outside\nthe training data domain. In deployment, the spacecraft trajectory is the\nprimary source of dynamics data. Therefore, the training data domain should\ninclude spacecraft trajectories to accurately evaluate the learned model's\nsafety and robustness. We have developed a novel method for learning-based\ngravity models that directly uses the spacecraft's past trajectories. We\nfurther introduce a method to evaluate the safety and robustness of\nlearning-based techniques via comparing accuracy within and outside of the\ntraining domain. We demonstrate this safety and robustness method for two\nlearning-based frameworks: Gaussian processes and neural networks. Along with\nthe detailed analysis provided, we empirically establish the need for\nrobustness verification of learned gravity models when used for proximity\noperations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This study presents a C3.0 flare observed by the BBSO/GST and IRIS, on\n2018-May-28 around 17:10 UT. The Near Infrared Imaging Spectropolarimeter\n(NIRIS) of GST was set to spectral imaging mode to scan five spectral positions\nat $\\pm$ 0.8 \u00c5, $\\pm$ 0.4 \u00c5and line center of He I 10830. At the flare\nribbon's leading edge the line is observed to undergo enhanced absorption,\nwhile the rest of the ribbon is observed to be in emission. When in emission,\nthe contrast compared to the pre-flare ranges from about $30~\\%$ to nearly\n$100~\\%$ at different spectral positions. Two types of spectra, \"convex\" shape\nwith higher intensity at line core and \"concave\" shape with higher emission in\nthe line wings, are found at the trailing and peak flaring areas, respectively.\nOn the ribbon front, negative contrasts, or enhanced absorption, of about $\\sim\n10\\% - 20\\%$ appear in all five wavelengths. This observation strongly suggests\nthat the negative flares observed in He I 10830 with mono-filtergram previously\nwere not caused by pure Doppler shifts of this spectral line. Instead, the\nenhanced absorption appears to be a consequence of flare energy injection,\nnamely non-thermal collisional ionization of helium caused by the precipitation\nof high energy electrons, as found in our recent numerical modeling results. In\naddition, though not strictly simultaneous, observations of Mg II from the IRIS\nspacecraft, show an obvious central reversal pattern at the locations where\nenhanced absorption of He I 10830 is seen, which is in consistent with previous\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Sheaths ahead of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large heliospheric\nstructures that form with CME expansion and propagation. Turbulent and\ncompressed sheaths contribute to the acceleration of particles in the corona\nand in interplanetary space, but the relation of their internal structures to\nparticle energization is still relatively little studied. In particular, the\nrole of sheaths in accelerating particles when the shock Mach number is low is\na significant open problem. This work seeks to provide new insights on the\ninternal structure of CME sheaths with regard to energetic particle\nenhancements. A good opportunity to achieve this aim was provided by\nobservations of a sheath made by radially aligned spacecraft at 0.8 and $\\sim$\n1 AU (Solar Orbiter, Wind, ACE and BepiColombo) on 19-21 April 2020. The sheath\nwas preceded by a weak shock. Energetic ion enhancements occurred at different\nlocations within the sheath structure at Solar Orbiter and L1. Magnetic\nfluctuation amplitudes at inertial-range scales increased in the sheath\nrelative to the upstream wind. However, when normalised to the local mean\nfield, fluctuation amplitudes did not increase significantly; magnetic\ncompressibility of fluctuation also did not increase. Various substructures\nwere embedded within the sheath at the different spacecraft, including multiple\nheliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings and a small-scale flux rope. At L1,\nthe ion flux enhancement was associated with the HCS crossings, while at Solar\nOrbiter, the enhancement occurred within the rope. Substructures that are swept\nfrom the upstream solar wind and compressed in the sheath can act as\nparticularly effective acceleration sites. A possible acceleration mechanism is\nbetatron acceleration associated with the small-scale flux rope and the warped\nHCS in the sheath.",

ONC-T is a\ntelescopic framing camera with a charge-coupled device (CCD), has seven filter\nbands in ultraviolet, visible and near infrared wavelength ranges, and were\nused to map the spectral distribution of the Ryugu surface. Since the locations\nof a target seen in ONC-T images are slightly different among different\nwavelength images in one multi-band observation sequence due to changes in\nspacecraft positions and attitudes during the filter-changing sequence, one of\nthe image processing issues is image co-registration among images for different\nwavelength bands. To quickly complete the image co-registration to meet a\nlimited mission schedule, we combined conventional image co-registration\ntechniques with several improvements based on previous planetary missions. The\nresults of our analysis using actual ONC-T images indicate that image\nco-registration can reach accuracy on the order of 0.1 pixels, which is\nsufficient for many spectral mapping applications for Ryugu analyses.",

We model this feature through\nthe late collision of two relativistic shells and investigate the corresponding\nhigh-energy neutrino emission within a multi-messenger framework, while\ncontrasting our findings with the ones from the classic fireball model. For a\nconstant density circumburst medium, the total number of emitted neutrinos can\nincrease by about an order of magnitude within a dynamical time when an optical\njump occurs with respect to the self-similar afterglow scenario. By exploring\nthe detection prospects with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and future radio\narrays such as IceCube-Gen2 radio, RNO-G and GRAND200k, as well as the POEMMA\nspacecraft, we conclude that the detection of neutrinos with IceCube-Gen2 radio\ncould enable us to constrain the fraction of GRB afterglows with a jump as well\nas the properties of the circumburst medium.

These flux ropes are also present in the simulations, forming at\nthe tip of helmet streamers, i.e. at the base of the heliospheric current\nsheet.

Gyrokinetic numerical simulations are used to\nexplore the first step of electron energization, and we generate the first\nexamples of field-particle correlation (FPC) signatures of electron\nenergization in 2D strong-guide-field collisionless magnetic reconnection.

Modeling of these velocity-space signatures shows that, in\nthe strong-guide-field limit, the energization of electrons occurs through bulk\nacceleration of the out-of-plane electron flow by parallel electric field that\ndrives the reconnection, a non-resonant mechanism of energization.

We present statistics\nof the direction, width, and electrostatic potential of wakes, and we compare\nwith an analytical model. In the low-density magnetospheric lobes, the\nequivalent positive spacecraft charging is large compared to the ion drift\nenergy and an enhanced wake forms. In this case observations of the geophysical\nelectric field with the double-probe technique becomes extremely challenging.\nRather, the wake can be used to estimate the flux of cold (eV) positive ions.\nFor an intermediate range of parameters, when the equivalent charging of the\nspacecraft is similar to the drift energy of the ions, also the charged wire\nbooms of a double-probe instrument must be taken into account. We discuss an\nexample of these effects from the MMS spacecraft near the magnetopause. We find\nthat many observed wake characteristics provide information that can be used\nfor scientific studies.

However, we still do not know much about the impact of\nrotation on the planetary internal structure as well as their formation. The\ncentrifugal force induced by rotation deforms the planetary shape and partially\ncounteracts the gravitational force. Thus, rotation will affect the critical\ncore mass of the exoplanet. Once the atmospheric mass becomes comparable to the\ncritical core mass, the planet will enter the runaway accretion phase and\nbecomes a gas giant. We have confirmed that the critical core masses of\nrotating planets depend on the stiffness of the polytrope, the outer boundary\nconditions, and the thickness of the isothermal layer. The critical core mass\nwith Bondi boundary condition is determined by the surface properties. The\ncritical core mass of a rotating planet will increase with the core gravity\n(i.e., the innermost density). For the Hill boundary condition, the soft\npolytrope shares the same properties as planets with Bondi boundary condition.\nSince the total mass for planets with Hill boundary condition increases with\nthe decrease of the polytropic index, higher core gravity is required for\nrotating planets. As a result, the critical core mass in the stiff Hill model\nsharply increases. The rotation effects become more important when the\nradiative and convective regions coexist. Besides, the critical core mass of\nplanets with Hill (Bondi) boundary increases noticeably as the radiative layer\nbecomes thinner (thicker).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  At least two active plumes were observed on Neptune's moon Triton during the\nVoyager 2 flyby in 1989. Models for Triton's plumes have previously been\ngrouped into five hypotheses, two of which are primarily atmospheric phenomena\nand are generally considered unlikely, and three of which include eruptive\nprocesses and are plausible. These hypotheses are compared, including new\narguments, such as comparisons based on current understanding of Mars,\nEnceladus, and Pluto. An eruption model based on a solar-powered, solid-state\ngreenhouse effect was previously considered the leading hypothesis for Triton's\nplumes, in part due to the proximity of the plumes to the subsolar latitude\nduring the Voyager 2 flyby and the distribution of Triton's fans that are\nputatively deposits from former plumes. The other two eruption hypotheses are\npowered by internal heat, not solar insolation. Based on new analyses of the\nostensible relation between the latitude of the subsolar point on Triton and\nthe geographic locations of the plumes and fans, we argue that neither the\nlocations of the plumes nor fans are strong evidence in favor of the\nsolar-powered hypothesis. We conclude that all three eruption hypotheses should\nbe considered further. Five tests are presented that could be implemented with\nremote sensing observations from future spacecraft to confidently distinguish\namong the eruption hypotheses for Triton's plumes. The five tests are based on\nthe: (1) composition and thickness of Triton's southern hemisphere terrains,\n(2) composition of fan deposits, (3) distribution of active plumes, (4)\ndistribution of fans, and (5) surface temperature at the locations of plumes\nand/or fans.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Asteroidal impact threats to the Earth will be predicted a century or more in\nadvance. Changing an asteroid's albedo changes the force of Solar radiation on\nit, and hence its orbit. Albedo may be changed by applying a thin ($\\sim\n0.1\\,\\mu$) reflective coat of alkali metal, dispensed as vapor by an orbiting\nspacecraft. A complete coat reduces the effective Solar gravity, changing the\norbital period. A Tunguska-class (50 m diameter) asteroid in a nominal orbit\nwith perihelion 1 AU and aphelion 3 AU ($a = 2\\,$AU, $e = 0.5$) may be\ndisplaced along its path by $\\sim 1000\\,$km in 100 years, sufficient to avoid\nimpact in a populated area, by application of one kg of lithium or sodium metal\nover its entire surface. Alternatively, coating one hemisphere of an asteroid\nin an elliptical orbit may produce a Solar radiation torque, analogous to but\ndistinct from the Yarkovsky effect, displacing it by an Earth radius in $\\sim\n200$ years. The time required scales as the square root of the asteroid's\ndiameter (the 1/6 power of its mass) because the displacement increases\nquadratically with time, making it possible to prevent the catastrophic impact\nof a km-sized asteroid with a minimal mass.",

Through\nlaboratory experiments and spacecraft observations, significant experimental\nprogress has been made in demonstrating how fast dissipation and reconnection\noccurs in narrow, kinetic-scale current sheets. However, a challenge has been\nto demonstrate what triggers reconnection and how it proceeds rapidly and\nefficiently as part of a global system much larger than these kinetic scales.\nHere we show experimentally the full development of a process where the current\nsheet forms and then breaks up into multiple current-carrying structures at the\nion kinetic scale. The results are consistent with tearing of the current\nsheet, however modified by collisionless kinetic ion effects, which leads to a\nlarger growth rate and number of plasmoids than observed in previous\nexperiments or compared to predictions from standard tearing instability theory\nand previous non-linear kinetic reconnection simulations. This effect will\nincrease the role of plasmoid instabilities in many natural reconnection\nsystems and should be considered in triggering rapid reconnection in a broad\nrange of natural plasmas with collisionless, compressible flows, including at\nthe Earth's magnetosheath and magnetotail and at the heliopause, in accretion\ndisks, and in turbulent high-Mach-number collisionless shocks.",

To solve the issue, the \"correction\n- prediction\" strategy is usually employed. In the method, one parameter is\nfixed and other parameters are revised by inverting spacecraft orbit data.\nHowever, based on a single spacecraft data, the strategy usually performs\npoorly as parameters in drag force calculation are coupled with each other,\nwhich result in convoluted errors. A gravity field recovery and atmospheric\ndensity detection satellite, Q-Sat, developed by xxxxx Lab at xxx University,\nis launched on August 6th, 2020. The satellite is designed to be spherical for\na constant drag coefficient regardless of its attitude. An orbit prediction\nmethod for low-earth orbit spacecraft with employment of Q-Sat data is proposed\nin present paper for decoupling atmospheric density and drag coefficient\nidentification. For the first step, by using a dynamic approach-based\ninversion, several empirical atmospheric density models are revised based on\nQ-Sat orbit data. Depending on the performs, one of the revised atmospheric\ndensity model would be selected for the next step in which the same inversion\nis employed for drag coefficient identification for a low-earth orbit operating\nspacecraft whose orbit needs to be predicted. Finally, orbit prediction is\nconducted by extrapolation with the dynamic parameters in the previous steps.\nTests are carried out with the proposed method by using a GOCE satellite 15-day\ncontinuous orbit data. Compared with legacy \"correction - prediction\" method in\nwhich only GOCE data is employed, the accuracy of the 24-hour orbit prediction\nis improved by about 171m the highest for the proposed method. 14-day averaged\n24-hour prediction precision is elevated by approximately 70m.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar gravitational lens (SGL) offers unique capabilities for\nhigh-resolution imaging of faint, distant objects, such as exoplanets. In the\nnear future, a spacecraft carrying a meter-class telescope with a solar\ncoronagraph would be placed in the focal region of the SGL. That region begins\nat ~547 astronomical units from the Sun and occupies the vicinity of the\ntarget-specific primary optical axis - the line that connects the center of the\ntarget and that of the Sun. This axis undergoes complex motion as the exoplanet\norbits its host star, as that star moves with respect to the Sun, and even as\nthe Sun itself moves with respect to the solar system's barycenter due to the\ngravitational pull of planets in our solar system. An image of an extended\nobject is projected by the SGL into an image plane and moves within that plane,\nresponding to the motion of the optical axis. To sample the image, a telescope\nmust follow the projection with precise knowledge of its own position with\nrespect to the image. We consider the dominant motions that determine the\nposition of the focal line as a function of time. We evaluate the needed\nnavigational capability for the telescope to conduct a multiyear exoplanet\nimaging mission. We show that even in a rather conservative case, when an\nEarth-like exoplanet is in our stellar neighborhood at $\\sim10$ light years,\nthe motion of the image is characterized by a small total acceleration $\\sim\n6.1\\,\\mu {\\rm m/s}^2$ that is driven primarily by the orbital motion of the\nexoplanet and by the reflex motion of our Sun. We discuss how the amplified\nlight of the host star allows establishing a local reference frame thus\nrelaxing navigational requirements. We conclude that the required navigation in\nthe SGL's focal region, although complex, can be accurately modeled and a $\\sim\n10$-year imaging mission is achievable with the already available propulsion\ntechnology.",

These fundamental\nmotions are obtained using Lyapunov-Floquet theory. In the case that the\ndynamics are perturbed by the action of a controller or by unmodeled dynamics,\nthe weights on each fundamental solution are allowed to vary as in a\nvariation-of-parameters approach, and in this manner function as state\nvariables. This methodology reveals interesting insights about satellite\nrelative motion and also enables elegant control approaches. This approach can\nbe applied in any dynamical environment as long as the chief orbit is periodic,\nand this is demonstrated with results for relative motion analysis and control\nin the eccentric Keplerian problem and in the circular restricted three-body\nproblem (CR3BP). Some commentary on extension of the methodology beyond the\nperiodic chief orbit case is also provided. This is a promising and widely\napplicable new approach to the close-proximity satellite relative motion\nproblem.",

We found that only two of the asteroids are spectrally compatible\nwith Ceres' surface. Further analysis of those two asteroids indicates that\nthey are spectrally young and thus less likely to be members of the Ceres\nfamily.\nConclusions: All in all, our results indicate that most of the 14 observed\nasteroids are not likely to belong to a Ceres collisional family.

In late 2022, DART will\ncollide with Dimorphos, the secondary in the Didymos binary asteroid system.\nThe impact will cause a momentum transfer from the spacecraft to the binary\nasteroid, changing the orbit period of Dimorphos and forcing it to librate in\nits orbit. Owing to the coupled dynamics in binary asteroid systems, the orbit\nand libration state of Dimorphos are intertwined. Thus, as the secondary\nlibrates, it also experiences fluctuations in its orbit period. These\nvariations in the orbit period are dependent on the magnitude of the impact\nperturbation, as well as the system's state at impact and the moments of\ninertia of the secondary. In general, any binary asteroid system whose\nsecondary is librating will have a non-constant orbit period on account of the\nsecondary's fluctuating spin rate. The orbit period variations are typically\ndriven by two modes: a long-period and short-period, each with significant\namplitudes on the order of tens of seconds to several minutes. The fluctuating\norbit period offers both a challenge and an opportunity in the context of the\nDART mission. Orbit period oscillations will make determining the post-impact\norbit period more difficult, but can also provide information about the\nsystem's libration state and the DART impact.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The impact of interplanetary shocks on the magnetosphere can trigger magnetic\nsubstorms that intensify auroral electrojet currents. These currents enhance\nground magnetic field perturbations (d$B$/d$t$), which in turn generate\ngeomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that can be detrimental to power\ntransmission infrastructure. We perform a comparative study of d$B$/d$t$\nvariations in response to two similarly strong shocks, but with one being\nnearly frontal, and the other, highly inclined. Multi-instrument analyses by\nthe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\n(THEMIS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory spacecraft show that nightside\nsubstorm-time energetic particle injections are more intense and occur faster\nin the case of the nearly head-on impact. The same trend is observed in\nd$B$/d$t$ variations recorded by THEMIS ground magnetometers. THEMIS all-sky\nimager data show a fast and clear poleward auroral expansion in the first case,\nwhich does not clearly occur in the second case. Strong field-aligned currents\ncomputed with the spherical elementary current system (SECS) technique occur in\nboth cases, but the current variations resulting from the inclined shock impact\nare weaker and slower compared to the nearly frontal case. SECS analyses also\nreveal that geographic areas with d$B$/d$t$ surpassing the thresholds 1.5 and 5\nnT/s, usually linked to high-risk GICs, are larger and occur earlier due to the\nsymmetric compression caused by the nearly head-on impact. These results, with\nprofound space weather implications, suggest that shock impact angles affect\nthe geospace driving conditions and the location and intensity of the\nsubsequent d$B$/d$t$ variations during substorm activity.",

We show that CO$_2$\nhydrates can become buoyant to the upper ice-water interface under plausible\noceanic conditions, namely, if the temperature or salinity conditions of a\ndensity-stratified two-layer water column evolve to permit the onset of\nconvection that generates a single mixed layer. To quantitatively describe the\neruptions once the CO$_2$ has been released from the hydrate state, we extend a\none-dimensional hydrodynamical model that draws from the literature on volcanic\nmagma explosions on Earth. Our results indicate that for a sufficiently high\nconcentration of exsolved CO$_2$, these eruptions develop vertical velocities\nof $\\sim$700 m s$^{-1}$. These high velocities permit the ejecta to reach\nheights of $\\sim$200 km above the Europan surface, thereby explaining the\nintermittent presence of water vapor at these high altitudes. Molecules ejected\nvia this process will persist in the Europan atmosphere for a duration of about\n10 minutes, limiting the timescale over which geyser activity above the Europan\nsurface may be observable. Our proposed mechanism requires Europa's ice shell\nthickness to be d$\\lesssim$ 10 km.",

We also aim to improve the understanding of why some consecutive\neruptions do not result in the expected geoeffectiveness, and how a secondary\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) can affect the configuration of the preceding one.\nMethods: Using the 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) package of the code\nMPI-AMRVAC, we numerically modeled consecutive CMEs inserted in two different\nsolar winds by imposing shearing motions onto the inner boundary. The initial\nmagnetic configuration depicts a triple arcade structure shifted southward, and\nembedded into a bimodal solar wind. We compared our simulated signatures with\nthose of a multiple CME event in Sept 2009 using data from spacecraft around\nMercury and Earth. We computed and analysed the Dst index for all the\nsimulations performed. Results: The observed event fits well at 1 AU with two\nof our simulations, one with a stealth CME and the other without. This\nhighlights the difficulty of attempting to use in situ observations to\ndistinguish whether or not the second eruption was stealthy, because of the\nprocesses the flux ropes undergo during their propagation in the interplanetary\nspace. We simulate the CMEs propagated in two different solar winds, one slow\nand another faster one. Only in the first case, plasma blobs arise in the trail\nof eruptions. Interestingly, the Dst computation results in a reduced\ngeoeffectiveness in the case of consecutive CMEs when the flux ropes arrive\nwith a leading positive Bz. When the Bz component is reversed, the\ngeoeffectiveness increases, meaning that the magnetic reconnections with the\ntrailing blobs and eruptions strongly affect the impact of the arriving\ninterplanetary CME.",

What are the causes of such changes? Do\nthe in situ properties of ICMEs differ depending on whether they exhibit\ncomplexity changes? We consider multi-spacecraft observations of 31 ICMEs by\nMESSENGER, Venus Express, ACE, and STEREO between 2008 and 2014 while radially\naligned. By analyzing their magnetic properties at the inner and outer\nspacecraft, we identify complexity changes which manifest as fundamental\nalterations or significant re-orientations of the ICME. Plasma and suprathermal\nelectron data at 1 au, and simulations of the solar wind enable us to\nreconstruct the propagation scenario for each event, and to identify critical\nfactors controlling their evolution. Results show that ~65% of ICMEs change\ntheir complexity between Mercury and 1 au and that interaction with multiple\nlarge-scale solar wind structures is the driver of these changes. Furthermore,\n71% of ICMEs observed at large radial (>0.4 au) but small longitudinal (<15\ndegrees) separations exhibit complexity changes, indicating that propagation\nover large distances strongly affects ICMEs. Results also suggest ICMEs may be\nmagnetically coherent over angular scales of at least 15 degrees, supporting\nearlier theoretical and observational estimates. This work presents statistical\nevidence that magnetic complexity changes are consequences of ICME interactions\nwith large-scale solar wind structures, rather than intrinsic to ICME\nevolution, and that such changes are only partly identifiable from in situ\nmeasurements at 1 au.",

We combine the Juno catalog with the HELCATS catalog to create a\ndataset of ICMEs covering 0.3-5.4 AU. Using a linear regression model to fit\nthe combined dataset on a double-logarithmic plot, we find that there is a\nclear difference between global expansion rates for ICMEs observed at lesser\nheliocentric distances and those observed farther out beyond 1 AU.
