    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2 (103P) was the target of the NASA\nEPOXI mission. In support of this mission, we conducted observations from radio\nto submillimeter wavelengths of comet 103P in the three weeks preceding the\nspacecraft rendezvous on UT 2010 November 4.58. This time period included the\npassage at perihelion and the closest approach of the comet to the Earth. Here\nwe report detections of HCN, H2CO, CS, and OH and upper limits for HNC and DCN\ntowards 103P, using the Arizona Radio Observatory Kitt Peak 12m telescope (ARO\n12m) and submillimeter telescope (SMT), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope\n(JCMT) and the Greenbank Telescope (GBT). The water production rate, QH2O =\n(0.67 - 1.07) x 10^28 s^-1, was determined from the GBT OH data. From the\naverage abundance ratios of HCN and H2CO relative to water (0.13 +/- 0.03 % and\n0.14 +/- 0.03 %, respectively), we conclude that H2CO is depleted and HCN is\nnormal with respect to typically-observed cometary mixing ratios. However, the\nabundance ratio of HCN with water shows a large diversity with time. Using the\nJCMT data we measured an upper limit for the DCN/HCN ratio <0.01. Consecutive\nobservations of ortho- H2CO and para-H2CO on November 2 (from data obtained at\nthe JCMT), allowed us to derive an ortho : para ratio (OPR) ~ 2.12 +/- 0.59\n(1sigma), corresponding to Tspin > 8 K (2sigma).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Yarkovsky (orbital drift) and YORP (spin state change) effects play\nimportant roles in the dynamical and physical evolution of asteroids.\nThermophysical modelling of these observed effects, and of thermal-infrared\nobservations, allows a detailed physical characterisation of an individual\nasteroid to be performed. We perform a detailed physical characterisation of\nnear-Earth asteroid (1620) Geographos, a potential meteor stream source and\nformer spacecraft target, using the same techniques as previously used in\nRozitis et al. (2013) for (1862) Apollo. We use the advanced thermophysical\nmodel (ATPM) on published light-curve, radar, and thermal-infrared observations\nto constrain the thermophysical properties of Geographos. The derived\nproperties are used to make detailed predictions of the Yarkovsky orbital drift\nand YORP rotational acceleration, which are then compared against published\nmeasurements to determine Geographos's bulk density. We find that Geographos\nhas a thermal inertia of 340 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a roughness fraction of\n>50%, and a bulk density of 2100 +550/-450 kg m-3 when using the\nlight-curve-derived shape model with the radar-derived maximum equatorial\ndiameter of 5.04 +/- 0.07 km. It is also found that the radar observations had\noverestimated the z-axis in Geographos's shape model because of their\nnear-equatorial view. This results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared\nobservations if its effective diameter is kept fixed in the model fitting. The\nthermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical\nvalues for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density\nsuggests a rubble-pile interior structure. Large uncertainties in shape model\nz-axes are likely to explain why radar and thermal-infrared observations\nsometimes give inconsistent diameter determinations for other asteroids.",

NEAT requires the capability to measure stellar centroids at the\nprecision of 5e-6 pixel. Current state-of-the-art methods for centroid\nestimation have reached a precision of about 2e-5 pixel at two times Nyquist\nsampling, this was shown at the JPL by the VESTA experiment. A metrology system\nwas used to calibrate intra and inter pixel quantum efficiency variations in\norder to correct pixelation errors. The European part of the NEAT consortium is\nbuilding a testbed in vacuum in order to achieve 5e-6 pixel precision for the\ncentroid estimation. The goal is to provide a proof of concept for the\nprecision requirement of the NEAT spacecraft.\nThe testbed consists of two main sub-systems. The first one produces pseudo\nstars: a blackbody source is fed into a large core fiber and lights-up a\npinhole mask in the object plane, which is imaged by a mirror on the CCD. The\nsecond sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The\nfringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the\nmirror. In this paper we present the experiments conducted and the results\nobtained since July 2013 when we had the first light on both the metrology and\npseudo stars.

Three years later, the OMEGA instrument was\nused to discover water ice deposited during southern summer on the polar cap\n(Langevin et al., 2007). However, temporal and spatial variations of these\nwater ice signatures have remained unexplored, and the origins of these water\ndeposits remains an important scientific question. To investigate this\nquestion, we have used observations from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging\nSpectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\n(MRO) spacecraft of the southern cap during austral summer over four Martian\nyears to search for variations in the amount of water ice.\nWe report below that for each year we have observed the cap, the magnitude of\nthe H2O ice signature on the southern cap has risen steadily throughout summer,\nparticularly on the west end of the cap. The spatial extent of deposition is in\ndisagreement with the current best simulations of deposition of water ice on\nthe south polar cap (Montmessin et al., 2007).\nThis increase in water ice signatures is most likely caused by deposition of\natmospheric H2O ice and a set of unusual conditions makes the quantification of\nthis transport flux using CRISM close to ideal. We calculate a 'minimum\napparent' amount of deposition corresponding to a thin H2O ice layer of 0.2mm\n(with 70 percent porosity). This amount of H2O ice deposition is 0.6-6 percent\nof the total Martian atmospheric water budget. We compare our 'minimal\napparent' quantification with previous estimates.\nThis deposition process may also have implications for the formation and\nstability of the southern CO2 ice cap, and therefore play a significant role in\nthe climate budget of modern day Mars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Kepler Spacecraft has discovered a large number of planets up to one-year\nperiods and down to terrestrial sizes. While the majority of the target stars\nare main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with\neffective temperature as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These\ncooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,\nyet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK\nstars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of\ndifferent spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the\nstar, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We\nfurther identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized\nplanets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital\nperiods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as\naround G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the\nstellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence\nrate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the\ninner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration\nof planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.",

Within this framework, the choice of next-generation\nmission targets and the characterisation of a potential threat to our planet\ndeserve special attention. To date, only a small part of the 11,000 discovered\nNEOs have been physically characterised. From ground and space-based\nobservations one can determine some basic physical properties of these objects\nusing visible and infrared spectroscopy. We present data for 13 objects\nobserved with different telescopes around the world (NASA-IRTF, ESO-NTT, TNG)\nin the 0.4 - 2.5 um spectral range, within the NEOSURFACE survey\n(this http URL). Objects are chosen from\namong the more accessible for a rendez-vous mission. All of them are\ncharacterised by a delta-V (the change in velocity needed for transferring a\nspacecraft from low-Earth orbit to rendez-vous with NEOs) lower than 10.5 km/s,\nwell below the Solar System escape velocity (12.3 km/s). We taxonomically\nclassify 9 of these objects for the first time. 11 objects belong to the\nS-complex taxonomy; the other 2 belong to the C-complex. We constrain the\nsurface composition of these objects by comparing their spectra with meteorites\nfrom the RELAB database. We also compute olivine and pyroxene mineralogy for\nasteroids with a clear evidence of pyroxene bands. Mineralogy confirms the\nsimilarity with the already found H, L or LL ordinary chondrite analogues.",

Here, we turn to\nthe quintessential hazy world -- Titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazes\ninfluence transit spectra. We use solar occultation observations of Titan's\natmosphere from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard\nNASA's Cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. Data span 0.88-5 microns\nat a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. Our\napproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit\nradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,\nrefraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to\nexplore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong\nmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most\nimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limit\nthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to\npressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. Unlike the usual\nassumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations of\npotentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, and\ncreates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to those\nfrom the strongest gaseous absorption features. These findings have important\nconsequences for interpreting future exoplanet observations, including those\nfrom NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.",

It has been notoriously difficult to\nextract information about energetic particle spectra in the corona, due to lack\nof in-situ measurements. It is possible, however, to combine remote\nobservations with data-driven models in order to deduce coronal shock\nproperties relevant to the local acceleration of SEPs and their heliospheric\nconnectivity to near-Earth space. We present such novel analysis applied to the\nMay 11, 2011 CME event on the western solar limb, focusing on the evolution of\nthe eruption-driven, dome-like shock wave observed by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) EUV telescopes on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nspacecraft. We analyze the shock evolution and estimate its strength using\nemission measure modeling. We apply a new method combining a geometric model of\nthe shock front with a potential field source surface model to estimate\ntime-dependent field-to-shock angles and heliospheric connectivity during shock\npassage in the low corona. We find that the shock was weak, with an initial\nspeed of ~450 km/s. It was initially mostly quasi-parallel, but significant\nportion of it turned quasi-perpendicular later in the event. There was good\nmagnetic connectivity to near-Earth space towards the end of the event as\nobserved by the AIA instrument. The methods used in this analysis hold a\nsignificant potential for early characterization of coronal shock waves and\nforecasting of SEP spectra based on remote observations.",

Our study includes the differences that the plasma environment makes\nto the efficiency of the shielding from the high energy charged particle\ncomponent of solar and cosmic rays, which radically alters the power\nrequirements. The incoming electrostatic charges are shielded by fields\nsupported by the self captured environmental plasma of the solar wind,\npotentially augmented with additional density. The artificial magnetic field\ngenerated on board acts as the means of confinement and control. Evidence for\nsimilar behaviour of electromagnetic fields and ionised particles in\ninterplanetary space can be gained by the example of the enhanced shielding\neffectiveness of naturally occurring \"mini-magnetospheres\" on the moon. The\nshielding effect of surface magnetic fields of the order of ~100s nanoTesla is\nsufficient to provide effective shielding from solar proton bombardment that\nculminate in visible discolouration of the lunar regolith known as \"lunar\nswirls\".

While these properties are rather\npoorly known for galactic and interstellar plasmas due to the lack of in situ\nmeasurements, the heliospheric plasma environment has been probed by spacecraft\nfor decades and provides a unique opportunity for testing transport theories.\nOf particular interest for the 3D heliospheric transport of energetic particles\nare structures such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs), which, due to\nstrongly enhanced magnetic field strengths, turbulence, and associated shocks,\ncan act as diffusion barriers on the one hand, but also as accelerators of low\nenergy CRs on the other hand as well. In a two-fold series of papers we\ninvestigate these effects by modeling inner-heliospheric solar wind conditions\nwith a numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setup (this paper), which will serve\nas an input to a transport code employing a stochastic differential equation\n(SDE) approach (second paper). In this first paper we present results from 3D\nMHD simulations with our code CRONOS: for validation purposes we use analytic\nboundary conditions and compare with similar work by Pizzo. For a more\nrealistic modeling of solar wind conditions, boundary conditions derived from\nsynoptic magnetograms via the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model are utilized, where\nthe potential field modeling is performed with a finite-difference approach\n(FDIPS) in contrast to the traditional spherical harmonics expansion often\nutilized in the WSA model. Our results are validated by comparing with\nmulti-spacecraft data for ecliptical (STEREO-A/B) and out-of-ecliptic (Ulysses)\nregions.",

During its two-year\nmission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at\nleast 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in\nbrightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an\ninterval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's\necliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the\necliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with\nthe James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target\nstars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded\nevery 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by\nthe pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to\ncharacterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a\nthousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in\nsize to the Earth.

Metal\nstructures, while used in space, are subjected to the full spectrum of the\nelectromagnetic radiation together with particle irradiation. Hence, they\nundergo degradation. Future space missions are planned to proceed in the\ninterplanetary space, where the protons of the solar wind play a very\ndestructive role on metallic surfaces. Unfortunately, their real degradation\nbehavior is to a great extent unknown.\nOur aim is to predict materials' behavior in such a destructive environment.\nTherefore both, theoretical and experimental studies are performed at the\nGerman Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bremen, Germany.\nHere, we report the theoretical results of those studies. We examine the\nprocess of H2-bubble formation on metallic surfaces. H2-bubbles are metal caps\nfilled with Hydrogen molecular gas resulting from recombination processes of\nthe metal free electrons and the solar protons. A thermodynamic model of the\nbubble growth is presented. Our model predicts e.g. the velocity of that growth\nand the reflectivity of foils populated by bubbles.\nFormation of bubbles irreversibly changes the surface quality of irradiated\nmetals. Thin metallic films are especially sensitive for such degradation\nprocesses. They are used e.g. in the solar sail propulsion technology. The\nefficiency of that technology depends on the thermo-optical properties of the\nsail materials. Therefore, bubble formation processes have to be taken into\naccount for the planning of long-term solar sail missions.",

In this paper, we investigate the\ninterplay that would happen between a reservoir of liquid hydrocarbons located\nin Titan's subsurface and a hypothetical clathrate reservoir that progressively\nforms if the liquid mixture diffuses throughout a preexisting porous icy layer.\nTo do so, we use a statistical-thermodynamic model in order to compute the\ncomposition of the clathrate reservoir that forms as a result of the\nprogressive entrapping of the liquid mixture. This study shows that clathrate\nformation strongly fractionates the molecules between the liquid and the solid\nphases. Depending on whether the structure I or structure II clathrate forms,\nthe present model predicts that the liquid reservoirs would be mainly composed\nof either propane or ethane, respectively. The other molecules present in the\nliquid are trapped in clathrates. Any river or lake emanating from subsurface\nliquid reservoirs that significantly interacted with clathrate reservoirs\nshould present such composition. On the other hand, lakes and rivers sourced by\nprecipitation should contain higher fractions of methane and nitrogen, as well\nas minor traces of argon and carbon monoxide.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present the characterization of the Kepler-93 exoplanetary system, based\non three years of photometry gathered by the Kepler spacecraft. The duration\nand cadence of the Kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of the\nstar, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. We\nconduct an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry and conclude that\nthe star has an average density of 1.652+/-0.006 g/cm^3. Its mass of\n0.911+/-0.033 M_Sun renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismic\nstudy. An analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet Kepler-93b,\nwhich appears with a period of 4.72673978+/-9.7x10^-7 days, returns a\nconsistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+0.02-0.28\ng/cm^3. The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary\ninterpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared\nbetween Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion.\nWe observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we\nconducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather\nthis subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio\nR_p/R_star. We find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of\n0.919+/-0.011 R_Sun with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetary\nradius of 1.481+/-0.019 R_Earth. The uncertainty of 120 km on our measurement\nof the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measured\nplanetary radii outside of the Solar System. Together with the radius, the\nplanetary mass of 3.8+/-1.5 M_Earth corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3+/-2.6\ng/cm^3. After applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities of\nsimilarly-sized worlds between 1--1.5 R_Earth, we find that Kepler-93b\npossesses an average density within this group.",

In previous work, using data from the\nHinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, upflow velocity evolution was extensively\nstudied as the region crossed the disc while a linear force-free magnetic\nextrapolation was used to confirm aspects of the velocity evolution and to\nestablish the presence of quasi-separatrix layers at the upflow source areas.\nThe plasma properties, temperature, density and first ionisation potential bias\n(FIP-bias) were measured with the spectrometer during the disc passage of the\nactive region. Global potential field source surface (PFSS) models showed that\nAR 10978 was completely covered by the closed field of a helmet streamer that\nis part of the streamer belt. Thus it is not clear how any of the upflowing\nAR-associated plasma could reach the source surface at 2.5 R(Sun)and contribute\nto the slow solar wind. However a detailed examination of solar-wind in-situ\ndata obtained by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft at the L1\npoint shows that the increase in O^7+/O^6+, C^6+/C^5+ and Fe/O - a FIP-bias\nproxy - are present before the heliospheric current sheet crossing. These\nincreases, along with an accompanying reduction in proton velocity and an\nincrease in density are characteristic of both AR and slow-wind plasma. Finally\nwe describe a two-step reconnection process by which some of the upflowing\nplasma from the AR could reach the heliosphere.",

We have studied the statistical properties of these events using\nspectropolarimetric data from Hinode/SP. We also examined the upper photosphere\nand the low chromosphere using Mg i b2 and Ca ii h data from Hinode. Finally,\nwe have applied the SIRGAUSS inversion code to the polarimetric data in order\nto infer the atmospheric stratification of the physical parameters. We have\nalso obtained these physical parameters taking into account dynamical terms in\nthe equation of motion.\nThe Stokes V profiles display a bump that evolves in four different time\nsteps, and the total process lasts 108 seconds. The Stokes I shows a strongly\nbent red wing and the continuum signal exhibits a bright point inside an\nintergranular lane. This bright point is correlated with a strong redshift in\nthe Mg i b2 line and a bright feature in Ca ii h images. The model obtained\nfrom the inversion of the Stokes profiles is hotter than the average quiet-Sun\nmodel, with a vertical magnetic field configuration and field strengths in the\nrange of kG values. It also presents a LOS velocity stratification with a\nGaussian perturbation whose center is moving to deeper layers with time.\nWe have examined a particular type of event that can be described as a\nplasmoid of hot plasma that is moving downward from the top of the photosphere,\nplaced over intergranular lanes and always related to strong magnetic field\nconcentrations. We argue that the origin of this plasmoid could be a magnetic\nreconnection that is taking place in the chromosphere.",

We study the parameter space of these signals and\ndivide it into two subgroups, one related to the mission parameters and the\nother to the theory parameters that are determined by the gravity model. We\ninvestigate how the mission parameters affect the signal detectability\nconcluding that these parameters can be determined with the sufficient\nprecision from the navigation of the spacecraft and fixed during our analysis.\nFurther, we apply Bayesian parameter estimation and determine the accuracy to\nwhich the gravity theory parameters may be inferred.

We also perform a first investigation of non-Gaussian\n\"noise-glitches\" that may occur in the data.

We investigate the effect\non these estimates by relaxing this assumption and instead determining the\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) or thermal structure of the emitting plasma\nby re-analyzing RESIK data for a GOES class M1.0 flare on 2002 November~14\n(SOL2002-11-14T22:26) for which there was good data coverage. The analysis\nmethod uses a maximum-likelihood (Withbroe--Sylwester) routine for evaluating\nthe DEM. In a first step, called here AbuOpt, an optimized set of abundances of\nSi, S, Ar, and K is found that is consistent with the observed spectra. With\nthese abundances, the differential emission measure evolution during the flare\nis found. The abundance optimization leads to revised abundances of silicon and\nsulfur in the flare plasma: $A({\\rm S}) = 6.94 \\pm 0.06$ and $A({\\rm Si}) =\n7.56 \\pm 0.08$ (on a logarithmic scale with $A({\\rm H}) = 12$). Previously\ndetermined abundances of Ar, K, and Cl from an isothermal assumption are still\nthe preferred values. During the flare's maximum phase, the X-ray-emitting\nplasma has a basically two-temperature structure, with the cooler plasma with\napproximately constant temperature (3--6~MK) and a hotter plasma with\ntemperature $16-21$~MK. Using imaging data from the RHESSI hard X-ray\nspacecraft, the emission volume of the hot plasma is deduced from which lower\nlimits of the electron density $N_e$ and the thermal content of the plasma are\ngiven.",
