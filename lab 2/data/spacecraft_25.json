    "abstract": "Abstract:  The recent claims of g-mode detection have restarted the search for these\npotentially extremely important modes. These claims can be reassessed in view\nof the different data sets available from the SoHO instruments and ground-based\ninstruments. We produce a new calibration of the GOLF data with a more\nconsistent p-mode amplitude and a more consistent time shift correction\ncompared to the time series used in the past. The calibration of 22 years of\nGOLF data is done with a simpler approach that uses only the predictive radial\nvelocity of the SoHO spacecraft as a reference. Using p modes, we measure and\ncorrect the time shift between ground- and space-based instruments and the GOLF\ninstrument. The p-mode velocity calibration is now consistent to within a few\npercent with other instruments. The remaining time shifts are within $\\pm$ 5 s\nfor 99.8% of the time series.\nAccepted by A&A on June 29, 2018",

The analysis results are\nthen used for modifying the system's design, so that the expected properties\nare satisfied. A rigorous model-based design flow differs in that it aims at a\nsystem implementation derived from high-level models by applying a sequence of\nsemantics-preserving transformations. Properties established at any design step\nare preserved throughout the subsequent steps including the executable\nimplementation. We introduce such a design flow using a process network model\nof computation for application design at a high level, which combines streaming\nand reactive control processing with task parallelism. The schedulability of\nthe so-called FPPNs (Fixed Priority Process Networks) is well-studied and\nvarious solutions have been presented. This article focuses on the design\nflow's steps for deriving executable implementations on the BIP (Behavior -\nInteraction - Priority) runtime environment. FPPNs are designed using the TASTE\ntoolset, a convenient architecture description interface. In this way, the\ndevelopers do not program explicitly low-level real-time OS services and the\nschedulability properties are guaranteed throughout the design steps by\nconstruction. The approach has been validated on the design of a real\nspacecraft on-board application that has been scheduled for execution on an\nindustrial multicore platform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  An extensive analysis of Ulysses observations of the solar wind speed V from\n1990 to 2008 is undertaken. It is shown that the evolution of V with\nheliocentric distance r depends substantially on both the heliolatitude and the\nsolar activity cycle. Deviations from the predicted Parker's profile of V(r)\nare so considerable that cannot be explained by a scarcity of measurements or\nother technical effects. In particular, the expected smooth growth of the solar\nwind speed with r is typical only for the solar activity maximum and for low\nheliolatitudes (lower than +/-40deg), while at high latitudes, there are two\nV(r) branches: growing and falling. In the solar activity maximum, V increases\ntoward the solar pole in the North hemisphere only; however, in the South\nhemisphere, it decreases with heliolatitude. In the minimum of solar activity,\nthe profile of V(r) at low heliolatitudes has a local minimum between 2 and 5\nAU. This result is confirmed by the corresponding data from other spacecraft\n(Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10). Unexpected spatial variations in V at low\nheliolatitudes can be explained by the impact of coronal hole flows on the V(r)\nprofile since the flows incline to the ecliptic plane. To reproduce the impact\nof spatial variations of V in the polar corona on the behavior of V at low\nheliolatitudes, a stationary one-fluid ideal MHD-model is developed with\naccount of recent results on imagery of the solar wind speed in the corona up\nto 5.5 solar radii obtained on the basis of combined observations from\nSOHO/UVCS, LASCO, and Mauna Loa.",

The DIOGENESS spectra are compared with spectra from a\nsynthesis code developed here based on an isothermal assumption with various\natomic sources including dielectronic satellite data from the Cowan\nHartree--Fock code. Best-fit comparisons are made by varying the temperature as\nthe code's input (Ar/Ca abundance ratio fixed at 0.33); close agreement is\nachieved although with adjustments to some ion fractions.

The main scientific goal of LPF was to demonstrate measurements of\ndifferential acceleration between free-falling test masses at the sub-femto-g\nlevel, and to understand the residual acceleration in terms of a physical model\nof stray forces, and displacement readout noise. A key step toward reaching the\nLPF goals was the correct calibration of the dynamics of LPF, which was a\nthree-body system composed by two test-masses enclosed in a single spacecraft,\nand subject to control laws for system stability. In this work, we report on\nthe calibration procedures adopted to calculate the residual differential stray\nforce per unit mass acting on the two test-masses in their nominal positions.\nThe physical parameters of the adopted dynamical model are presented, together\nwith their role on LPF performance. The analysis and results of these\nexperiments show that the dynamics of the system was accurately modeled and the\ndynamical parameters were stationary throughout the mission. Finally, the\nimpact and importance of calibrating system dynamics for future space-based\ngravitational wave observatories is discussed.",

We present\nmeasurements of the structure and composition of the LISM in the immediate path\nof the Voyager spacecraft by using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nspectra of nearby stars that lie along the same lines of sight. We provide a\ncomprehensive inventory of LISM absorption in the near-ultraviolet (2600-2800\nAngstroms) and far-ultraviolet (1200-1500 Angstroms). The LISM absorption\nprofiles are used to make comparisons between each pair of closely spaced (<15\ndeg) sight lines. With fits to several absorption lines, we make measurements\nof the physical properties of the LISM. We estimate electron density along the\nVoyager 2 sight line, and our values are consistent with recent measurements by\nVoyager 1. Excess absorption in the HI Ly-alpha line displays the presence of\nboth the heliosphere and an astrosphere around GJ 780. This is only the 14th\ndetection of an astrosphere, and the large mass-loss rate ($\\dot{M} =\n10\\dot{M}_\\odot$) is consistent with other subgiant stars. The heliospheric\nabsorption matches the predicted strength for a sight line 58 deg from the\nupwind direction. As both HST and Voyager reach the end of their lifetimes, we\nhave the opportunity to synthesize their respective observations, combining in\nsitu measurements with the shortest possible line-of-sight measurements to\nstudy the Galactic ISM surrounding the Sun.",

Interaction of protons, atoms, and ions at kinetic\nenergies relative to the spacecraft (MeV per nucleon) is essentially a problem\nof sputtering. More problematic is the impact of dust grains, macroscopic\nobjects on the order of 10 nm ($10^{-21}$ kg) to 1 $\\mu$m ($10^{-15}$ kg), the\neffects of which are difficult to calculate, and thus experiments are needed.\nThe maximum velocity of dust grains that can be achieved at present in the\nlaboratory using electrostatic methods is approximately 100 km/s, two orders of\nmagnitude below starflight velocities. The attainment of greater velocities has\nbeen previously considered in connection with the concept of impact fusion and\nwas concluded to be technologically very challenging. The reasons for this are\nexplained in terms of field emission, which limits the charge-to-mass ratio on\nthe macroscopic particle being accelerated as well as the voltage potential\ngradient of the accelerating electrostatic field, resulting in the accelerator\nneeding to be hundreds to thousands of kilometers long for $\\mu$m-sized grains.\nUse of circular accelerators (cyclotrons and synchrotrons) is not practical due\nto limitations on magnetic field strength making the accelerator thousands of\nkilometers in size for $\\mu$m-sized grains. Electromagnetic launchers\n(railguns, coilguns) have not been able to produce velocities greater than\nconventional gas guns (< 10 km/s). The nearest feasible technologies (tandem\naccelerators, macromolecular accelerators) to reach the regime of projectile\nmass and velocity of interest are reviewed. Pulsed lasers are found to be the\nonly facilities able to accelerate condensed phase matter to velocities\napproaching 1000 km/s but unlikely to be able to reach greater speeds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Variational Data Assimilation (DA) has enabled huge improvements in the skill\nof operational weather forecasting. In this study, we use a simple solar-wind\npropagation model to develop the first solar-wind variational DA scheme. This\nscheme enables solar-wind observations far from the Sun, such as at 1 AU, to\nupdate and improve the inner boundary conditions of the solar wind model (at\n$30$ solar radii). In this way, observational information can be used to\nimprove estimates of the near-Earth solar wind, even when the observations are\nnot directly downstream of the Earth. Using controlled experiments with\nsynthetic observations we demonstrate this method's potential to improve solar\nwind forecasts, though the best results are achieved in conjunction with\naccurate initial estimates of the solar wind. The variational DA scheme is also\napplied to STEREO in-situ observations using initial solar wind conditions\nsupplied by a coronal model of the observed photospheric magnetic field. We\nconsider the period Oct 2010-Oct 2011, when the STEREO spacecraft were\napproximately $80^{\\circ}$ ahead/behind Earth in its orbit. For 12 of 13\nCarrington Rotations, assimilation of STEREO data improves the near-Earth solar\nwind estimate over the non-assimilated state, with a $18.4\\%$ reduction in the\nroot-mean-squared-error. The largest gains are made by the DA during times when\nthe steady-state assumption of the coronal models breaks down. While applying\nthis pure variational approach to complex solar-wind models is technically\nchallenging, we discuss hybrid DA approaches which are simpler to implement and\nmay retain many of the advantages demonstrated here.",

However, the Rosetta Plasma Consortium instruments showed a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) impact at the comet coincident with the emission\nincreases, suggesting that the CME impact may have been the cause of the\nincreased emission. The presence of the semi-forbidden O I 1356 $\u00c5$ emission\nmultiplet is indicative of a substantial increase in dissociative electron\nimpact emission from the coma, suggesting a change in the electron population\nduring the CME impact. The increase in dissociative electron impact could be a\nresult of the interaction between the CME and the coma of 67P or an outburst\ncoincident with the arrival of the CME. The observed dissociative electron\nimpact emission during this period is used to characterize the O2 content of\nthe coma at two peaks during the CME arrival. The mechanism that could cause\nthe relationship between the CME and UV emission brightness is not well\nconstrained, but we present several hypotheses to explain the correlation.",

A\nsurvey is underway to map the local ISMF using data collected at eight\nobservatories in both hemispheres. Two approaches are used to obtain the\nmagnetic structure: statistically evaluating magnetic field directions traced\nby multiple polarization position angles, and least-squares fits that provide\nthe dipole component of the magnetic field. We find that the magnetic field in\nthe circumheliospheric interstellar medium (CHM), which drives winds of\ninterstellar gas and dust through the heliosphere, drapes over the heliopause\nand influences polarization measurements. We discover a polarization band that\ncan be described with a great circle that traverses the heliosphere nose and\necliptic poles. A gap in the band appears in a region coinciding both with the\nhighest heliosheath pressure, found by IBEX, and the center of the Loop I\nsuperbubble. The least-squares analysis finds a magnetic dipole component of\nthe polarization band with the axis oriented toward the ecliptic poles. The\nfilament of dust around the heliosphere and the warm helium breeze flowing\nthrough the heliosphere trace the same magnetic field directions. Regions along\nthe polarization band near the heliosphere nose have magnetic field\norientations within 15 degrees of sightlines. Regions in the IBEX ribbon have\nfield directions within 40 degrees of the plane of the sky. Several spatially\ncoherent magnetic filaments are within 15 pc. Most of the low frequency radio\nemissions detected by the two Voyager spacecraft follow the polarization band.\nThe geometry of the polarization band is compared to the Local Interstellar\nCloud, the Cetus Ripple, the BICEP2 low opacity region, Ice Cube IC59 galactic\ncosmic ray data, and Cassini results.",

All the trajectories are parametrised by two characteristic radii,\nrE and rC, derived from first integrals. There are three different types of\nmotion possible divided by a separatrix corresponding to rE = rC. An analytical\nexpression of the trajectories, defined by an integral, is developed. Using\nthis formalism, the application to a flux of particles coming from infinity\n(modelling the incident solar wind) gives one free parameter only, the radius\nrE, which scales the problem. A circular cavity of radius 0.28 rE is created,\nas well as an overdensity curve (analogous to a caustic in optics). At each\nobservation time, rE can be calibrated to Rosetta plasma measurements, giving a\nqualitative understanding of the solar particle dynamics (incoming direction,\ncavity and density map).

Global numerical simulations and remote sensing observations\noffer a natural mode for the study of these surfaces at large scales, thus\nproviding valuable context for the high-resolution in-situ measurements\nexpected from the soon-to-be-launched Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The present\nstudy utilizes global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the\nsolar wind to characterize the critical surfaces and investigate the flow in\npropinquitous regions. Effects of solar activity are incorporated by varying\nsource magnetic dipole tilts and employing magnetogram-based boundary\nconditions. A magnetohydrodynamic turbulence model is self-consistently coupled\nto the bulk flow equations, enabling investigation of turbulence properties of\nthe flow in the vicinity of critical regions. The simulation results are\ncompared with a variety of remote sensing observations. A simulated PSP\ntrajectory is used to provide contextual predictions for the spacecraft in\nterms of the computed critical surfaces. Broad agreement is seen in the\ninterpretation of the present results in comparison with existing remote\nsensing results, both from heliospheric imaging and from radio scintillation\nstudies. The trajectory analyses show that the period of time that PSP is\nlikely to spend inside the $\\beta=1$, sonic and Alfv\u00e9n surfaces depends\nsensitively on the degree of solar activity and the tilt of the solar dipole\nand location of the heliospheric current sheet.",

As there is neither a reasonable nor even an unreasonable\nconventional astrophysical source for this newly-identified fraction of the\nradiation, we are led to speculate that the photons that we observe have their\norigin in the very slow decay of the particles that make up the ubiquitous dark\nmatter, which we know envelopes our Galaxy.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For dark matter (DM) particles with masses in the 0.6 - 6 m_p range, we set\nstringent constraints on the interaction cross-sections for scattering with\nordinary baryonic matter. These constraints follow from the recognition that\nsuch particles can be captured by - and thermalized within - the Earth, leading\nto a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM that interact with\nbaryons. Here, we discuss the probability that DM intercepted by the Earth will\nbe captured, the number of DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth's\nlifetime, the fraction of such particles retained in the face of evaporation,\nand the density distribution of such particles within the Earth. In the latter\ncontext, we note that a previous treatment of the density distribution of DM,\npresented by Gould and Raffelt and applied subsequently to DM in the Sun, is\ninconsistent with considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium. Our analysis\nprovides an estimate of the DM particle density at Earth's surface, which may\nexceed 1.E+14 cm-3 for the mass range under consideration. Based upon our\ndetermination of the DM density at Earth's surface, we derive constraints on\nthe scattering cross-sections. These constraints are placed by four\nconsiderations: (1) the lifetime of the relativistic proton beam at the Large\nHadron collider (LHC); (2) the orbital decay of spacecraft in low Earth orbit\n(LEO); (3) the vaporization rate of cryogenic liquids in well-insulated storage\ndewars; and (4) the thermal conductivity of Earth's crust. As an example\napplication of our results, we show that for the scattering cross-sections that\nwere invoked recently in Barkana's original explanation for the anomalously\ndeep 21 cm absorption reported by EDGES, DM particle masses in the 0.6 - 4 m_p\nrange are ruled out.",

Closest to\nSaturn, these bodies provide important clues regarding the formation process of\nsmall moons in close orbits around their host planet, but their range of\nirregular shapes has not been explained yet. Here we show that the spectrum of\nshapes among Saturn's small moons is a natural outcome of merging collisions\namong similar-sized moonlets possessing physical properties and orbits that are\nconsistent with those of the current moons. A significant fraction of such\nmerging collisions take place either at the first encounter or after 1-2\nhit-and-run events, with impact velocities in the range of 1-5 times the mutual\nescape velocity. Close to head-on mergers result in flattened objects with\nlarge equatorial ridges, as observed on Atlas and Pan. With slightly more\noblique impact angles, collisions lead to elongated, Prometheus-like shapes.\nThese results suggest that the current forms of the small moons provide direct\nevidence of the processes at the final stages of their formation, involving\npairwise encounters of moonlets of comparable size. Finally, we show that this\nmechanism may also explain the formation of Iapetus' equatorial ridge, as well\nas its oblate shape.",

We also aim to quantify and interpret the deflection and deceleration\nof the flow expected from ionization of neutral cometary particles within the\nundisturbed solar wind. Methods. We have analysed in situ ion and magnetic\nfield data and combined this with hybrid modeling of the interaction between\nthe solar wind and the comet atmosphere. Results. The solar wind deflection is\nincreasing with decreasing heliocentric distances, and exhibits very little\ndeceleration. This is seen both in observations and in modeled solar wind\nprotons. According to our model, energy and momentum are transferred from the\nsolar wind to the coma in a single region, centered on the nucleus, with a size\nin the order of 1000 km. This interaction affects, over larger scales, the\ndownstream modeled solar wind flow. The energy gained by the cometary ions is a\nsmall fraction of the energy available in the solar wind. Conclusions. The\ndeflection of the solar wind is the strongest and clearest signature of the\nmass-loading for a small, low-activity comet, whereas there is little\ndeceleration of the solar wind.",

Here we describe how the SOS pipeline\nwas modified to allow for processing the Gaia multiband (G, G_BP and G_RP) time\nseries photometry of all-sky candidate variables and produce specific results\nfor confirmed RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids that are published in the DR2\ncatalogue. The SOS Cep&RRL processing uses tools such as the period-amplitude\nand the period-luminosity relations in the G band. For the analysis of the Gaia\nDR2 candidates we also used tools based on the G_BP and G_RP photometry, such\nas the period-Wesenheit relation in (G,G_RP). Multiband time series photometry\nand characterisation by the SOS Cep&RRL pipeline are published in Gaia DR2 for\n150,359 such variables (9,575 classified as Cepheids and 140,784 as RR Lyrae\nstars) distributed all over the sky. The sample includes variables in 87\nglobular clusters and 14 dwarf galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, as of 25\nApril 2018, variability of 50,570 of these sources (350 Cepheids and 50,220 RR\nLyrae stars) is not known in the literature, hence likely they are new\ndiscoveries by Gaia. An estimate of the interstellar absorption is published\nfor 54,272 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars from a relation based on the G-band\namplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Fourier\nparameters of the light curves are also released for 64,932 RR Lyrae stars and\n3,738 fundamental-mode classical Cepheids with period shorter than 6.3 days.",

This paper reports on a\ndemonstration of 10 milliarcsecond-level astrometric precision on a dozen NEAs\nusing the Pomona College 40 inch telescope, at the JPL's Table Mountain\nFacility. We used the technique of synthetic tracking, in which many short\nexposure (1 second) images are acquired and then combined in post-processing to\ntrack both target asteroid and reference stars across the field of view. This\ntechnique avoids the trailing loss and keeps the jitter effects from atmosphere\nand telescope pointing common between the asteroid and reference stars,\nresulting in higher astrometric precision than the 100 mas level astrometry\nfrom traditional approach of using long exposure images. Treating our synthetic\ntracking of near-Earth asteroids as a proxy for observations of future\nspacecraft while they are downlinking data via their high rate optical\ncommunication laser beams, our approach shows precision plane-of-sky\nmeasurements can be obtained by the optical ground terminals for navigation. We\nalso discuss how future data releases from the Gaia mission can improve our\nresults.",

Previous observations show\nthat about $70\\%$ of CMEs are associated with prominence eruptions. However,\nthere are only a handful of reported observations of prominence plasma\nmaterials within interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), which are the interplanetary\nmanifestations of CMEs. Moreover, approximately $4\\%$ of ICMEs exhibit the\npresence of prominence materials, and approximately $12\\%$ of magnetic clouds\n(MCs) contain prominence materials. We aim to comprehensively search for cold\nprominence materials in MCs observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)\nspacecraft during 1998-2007. Using the criteria of unusual $O^{5+}$ and (or)\n$Fe^{6+}$ abundances, we examined 76 MCs observed by ACE during 1998-2007 to\nsearch for cold prominence materials. Our results revealed that out of the 76\nMCs, 27 ($36\\%$) events contained prominence material regions with\nlow-charge-state signatures. Although the fraction is still lower than the\napproximately $70\\%$ of CMEs associated with prominence eruptions, it is much\nhigher than $12\\%$.

In spite of the considerable number of\nobservational, modeling, and laboratory efforts, understanding the physics\nleading to the observed morphology of Europa's near surface O$_2$ atmosphere\nhas been problematic. This is the case as the observed emissions depend on the\nlocal incident plasma ion flux, the local temperature and composition of the\nregolith, as well as on the near surface electron temperature and density. Here\nwe rely heavily on earlier reviews briefly summarizing the observational,\nlaboratory and simulation efforts. Although it is agreed that radiolysis of the\nsurface ice by the incident Jovian plasma is the ultimate source of observed\nO$_2$, a recent, simple model of thermal desorption from a regolith permeated\nwith O$_2$ has changed the usual paradigm. This suggests that the observed\norbital dependence of the local source of the near-surface O$_2$ atmosphere is\ndue to thermal release of O$_2$ likely trapped on the ice grains at dangling\nbonds with a smaller contribution due to direct sputtering. This could also\nimpact our understanding of the suggestion that the radiolytic products in\nEuropa's regolith might be a source of oxidants for its underground ocean.",

Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains the observations of a selected\nsample of 14,099 SSOs. These asteroids have been already identified and have\nbeen numbered by the Minor Planet Center. Positions are provided for each Gaia\nobservation at CCD level. As additional information, the apparent brightness of\nSSOs in the unfiltered G band is also provided for selected observations. We\nexplain the processing of SSO data, and describe the criteria we used to select\nthe sample published in Gaia DR2. We then explore the data set to assess its\nquality. To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is\nnecessary to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as\nthe position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled\nappropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are\noverall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define\nindividual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals\nallowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the\nG band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to\nthe flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue photometers\n(RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations,\nwith an optimal range of brightness G~12-17. In this range, the typical\ntransit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing\nphoton noise deteriorates the performance. Asteroids brighter than G~12 are\naffected by a lower performance of the processing of their signals. The\ndramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2 astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by\npreliminary tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects.",

We find that 67P\ncould be a primordial body (i.e., not a collisional fragment) if the outer\nplanetesimal disk lasted <10 Myr before it was dispersed by migrating Neptune.\nThe probability of binary collapse by impact is 30% for tightly bound binaries.\nMost km-class binaries become collisionally dissolved. Roughly 10% of the\nsurviving binaries later evolve to become contact binaries during the disk\ndispersal, when bodies suffer gravitational encounters to Neptune.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The optical images of near-Earth asteroid 4179 Toutatis acquired by Chang'e-2\nspacecraft show that Toutatis has an elongated contact binary configuration,\nwith the contact point located along the long axis. We speculate that such\nconfiguration may have resulted from a low-speed impact between two components.\nIn this work, we performed a series of numerical simulations and compared the\nresults with the optical images, to examine the mechanism and better understand\nthe formation of Toutatis. Herein we propose an scenario that an assumed\nseparated binary precursor could undergo a close encounter with Earth, leading\nto an impact between the primary and secondary, and the elongation is caused by\nEarth's tide. The precursor is assumed to be a doubly synchronous binary with a\nsemi-major axis of 4 $R_p$ (radius of primary) and the two components are\nrepresented as spherical cohesionless self-gravitating granular aggregates. The\nmutual orbits are simulated in a Monte Carlo routine to provide appropriate\nparameters for our \\emph{N}-body simulations of impact and tidal distortion. We\nemploy the \\emph{pkdgrav} package with a soft-sphere discrete element method\n(SSDEM) to explore the entire scenarios. The results show that contact binary\nconfigurations are natural outcomes under this scenario, whereas the shape of\nthe primary is almost not affected by the impact of the secondary. However, our\nsimulations further provide an elongated contact binary configuration\nbest-matching to the shape of Toutatis at an approaching distance $r_p$ = 1.4\n$\\sim$ 1.5 $R_e$ (Earth radius), indicative of a likely formation scenario for\nconfigurations of Toutatis-like elongated contact binaries.",

By using data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) as well as hard X-ray data from\nKONUS instrument onboard WIND spacecraft, and Anti-Coincidence System (ACS)\nonboard the INTERGRAL space observatory, we investigate spatio-temporal\ndynamics of photospheric emission sources, identify sources of helioseismic\nwaves and compare the flare photospheric dynamics with the hard X-ray (HXR)\ntemporal profiles. The results show that the photospheric flare impacts started\nto develop in compact regions in close vicinity of the magnetic polarity\ninversion line (PIL) in the pre-impulsive phase before detection of the HXR\nemission. The initial photospheric disturbances were localized in the region of\nstrong horizontal magnetic field of the PIL, and, thus, are likely associated\nwith a compact sheared magnetic structure elongated along the PIL. The acoustic\negression power maps revealed two primary sources of generation of sunquakes,\nwhich were associated with places of the strongest photospheric impacts in the\npre-impulsive phase and the early impulsive phase. This can explain the two\ntypes of helioseismic waves observed in this flare. Analysis of the\nhigh-cadence HMI filtergrams suggests that the flare energy release developed\nin the form of sequential involvement of compact low-lying magnetic loops that\nwere sheared along the PIL.",
