The emphasis will be\ngiven on Ganymede as a small planetary body to be studied as a potential\nhabitat. The spacecraft is set for launch in 2022 and would reach Jupiter in\n2030. Two identical optical cameras are proposed for the mission to monitor the\nspacecraft and its surroundings. The sensors of the cameras need to be\nprotected from hazardous radiation levels caused by extremely high fluxes of\nvery energetic electrons. A precise model of the camera was developed to be\nused for intense Monte Carlo simulations performed to optimize the shielding\nand to determine the radiation damage during the mission. Simulations included\ndetermination of the total ionizing and non-ionizing doses in the sensors and\ncrucial electronic components. This paper presents both simulation methods and\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  There are thousands of asteroids in near-Earth space and millions expected in\nthe Main Belt. They are diverse in their physical properties and compositions.\nThey are also time capsules of the early Solar System making them valuable for\nplanetary science, and are strategic for resource mining, planetary\ndefense/security and as interplanetary depots. But we lack direct knowledge of\nthe geophysical behavior of an asteroid surface under milligravity conditions,\nand therefore landing on an asteroid and manipulating its surface material\nremains a daunting challenge.\nTowards this goal we are putting forth plans for a 12U CubeSat that will be\nin Low Earth Orbit and that will operate as a spinning centrifuge on-orbit. In\nthis paper, we will present an overview of the systems engineering and\ninstrumentation design on the spacecraft. Parts of this 12U CubeSat will\ncontain a laboratory that will recreate asteroid surface conditions by\ncontaining crushed meteorite. The laboratory will spin at 1 to 2 RPM during the\nprimary mission to simulate surface conditions of asteroids 2 km and smaller,\nfollowed by an extended mission where the spacecraft will spin at even higher\nRPM. The result is a bed of realistic regolith, the environment that landers\nand diggers and maybe astronauts will interact with. The CubeSat is configured\nwith cameras, lasers, actuators and small mechanical instruments to both\nobserve and manipulate the regolith at low simulated gravity conditions. A\nseries of experiments will measure the general behavior, internal friction,\nadhesion, dilatancy, coefficients of restitution and other parameters that can\nfeed into asteroid surface dynamics simulations. Effective gravity can be\nvaried, and external mechanical forces can be applied.",

Basic mission\nrequirements associated with a Mother-Daughter architecture are established\nutilizing a relatively large number (10-20) daughter spacecraft distributed\nfrom a mothership within the asteroid belt for the purpose of executing sample\nand return missions. A number of trade analyses are performed to establish\nsystem performance to changes in initial orbit, delta-V capability and maximum\nsmall spacecraft flight time. The balance between the initial delta-V burn and\nasteroid velocity matching are also examined, with a goal of minimizing the\namount of fuel needed in the small spacecraft. Preliminary requirements for the\nsystem are established using these results, and a conceptual design is\npresented for comparison to other asteroid exploration techniques. Preliminary\nresults indicate that the aforementioned concept of a mothership with small\nspacecraft is viable and should be considered as an alternative approach to\nfirst order surveying of the asteroid belt.",

Using the\nobserved crater fields on Charon and Pluto down to the resolution limit of the\n2015 New Horizons flyby of those bodies and estimates of the orbital\ndistribution of the crater-forming projectiles, we calculate the number of\ncraters per unit area formed as a function of the time a surface on 2014 MU69\nhas been exposed to bombardment. We find that if the shallow crater-size\ndistribution from 1-15 km exhibited on Pluto and Charon is indeed due to the\nsizes of Kuiper Belt projectiles, 2014 MU69 should exhibit a surface that is\nonly lightly cratered below 1 km scale, despite being bombarded for\n$\\sim4$~billion years. Its surface should therefore be more clearly indicative\nof its accretionary environment. In addition, this object may the first\nobserved for which the majority of the bombardment is from exogenic projectiles\nmoving less than or near the speed of sound in the target materials, implying\nmorphologies more akin to secondary craters elsewhere in the Solar System.\nLastly, if the shallow Kuiper Belt size distribution implied from the Pluto and\nCharon imaging is confirmed at MU69, then we conclude that this size\ndistribution is a preserved relic of its state $\\simeq$4.5~Gyr ago and provides\na direct constraint on the planetesimal formation process itself.",

However, the standard approach using the\ncollisional cold thick-target model poorly constrains the lower-energy part of\nthe accelerated electron spectrum, and hence the overall energetics of the\naccelerated electrons are typically constrained only to within one or two\norders of magnitude. Here we develop and apply a physically self-consistent\nwarm-target approach which involves the use of both hard X-ray spectroscopy and\nimaging data. The approach allows an accurate determination of the electron\ndistribution low-energy cutoff, and hence the electron acceleration rate and\nthe contribution of accelerated electrons to the total energy released, by\nconstraining the coronal plasma parameters. Using a solar flare observed in\nX-rays by the {\\em RHESSI} spacecraft, we demonstrate that using the standard\ncold-target methodology, the low-energy cutoff (and hence the energy content in\nelectrons) is essentially undetermined. However, the warm-target methodology\ncan determine the low-energy electron cutoff with $\\sim$7\\% uncertainty at the\n$3\\sigma$ level and hence permits an accurate quantitative study of the\nimportance of accelerated electrons in solar flare energetics.",

The OSIRIS/Narrow-Angle-Camera (NAC)\nacquired 112 images with mainly 3 broadband filters in the visible at a\nresolution of up to 0.53 m/px and for phase angles between 0.095\u00b0 and\n62\u00b0. Using those images, we have investigated the morphological and\nspectrophotometrical properties of this area. We assembled the images into\ncoregistered color cubes. Using a 3D shape model, we produced the illumination\nconditions and georeference for each image. We projected the observations on a\nmap to investigate its geomorphology. Observations were photometrically\ncorrected using the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. Spectrophotometric analyses were\nperformed on the coregistered color cubes. These data were used to estimate the\nlocal phase reddening. This region of the nucleus hosts numerous and varied\ntypes of terrains and features. We observe an association between a feature's\nnature, its reflectance, and its spectral slope. Fine material deposits exhibit\nan average reflectance and spectral slope, while terrains with diamictons,\nconsolidated material, degraded outcrops, or features such as somber boulders,\npresent a lower-than-average reflectance and higher-than-average spectral\nslope. Bright surfaces present here a spectral behavior consistent with\nterrains enriched in water-ice. We find a phase-reddening slope of\n0.064{\\pm}0.001{\\%}/100nm/\u00b0 at 2.7 au outbound, similarly to the one\nobtained at 2.3 au inbound during the February 2015 flyby.

The tracking performance of the\nnormalized Euclidean distance of attitude error is trapped to initially start\nwithin a large set and converge systematically and asymptotically to the origin\nfrom almost any initial condition. The convergence rate is guaranteed to be\nless than the prescribed value and the steady-state error does not exceed a\npredefined small value. The first filter uses a set of vectorial measurements\nwith the need for attitude reconstruction.

These\nfilters provide good attitude estimates with superior convergence properties\nand can be applied to measurements obtained from low cost inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar surface magnetic field seems to be able to explain variations in Total\nSolar Irradiance on timescales from hours to decades. Using magnetograms from\nspacecraft (MDI and HMI) and ground-based observatories (MWO and WSO) I build a\ncomposite dataset of the Total Line-of-Sight Unsigned Magnetic Flux over the\nsolar disk stretching back to 1976, validated by excellent correlations with\nthe solar microwave flux (F10.7) and the Sunspot Group Number. Direct\nmeasurements of TSI by space borne sensors have been carried out since late\n1978. The early instruments were plagued by scattered light entering the\naperture, but this construction flaw can be corrected for. At the AGU 2018\nmeeting, a new TSI composite has been proposed based on a novel mathematical\nmethod vetted by representatives from all current and most past TSI\ninstruments. Although an 'official' release of the dataset has not been offered\nyet, a preliminary version is available. Anticipating that any last-minute\nchanges might be minor, I compare this new version with the magnetic flux\ncomposite. It is clear that we have two TSI populations: values before 1993\nthat are seriously too low and values from 1993 onwards. I elect to normalize\nthe magnetic flux (the driver of variations of TSI) to a New TSI using the\nregression equation for the recent population with the smallest uncertainty.\nWith this normalization, there is now total agreement between the variation of\nthe magnetic flux and of the New TSI as well as with the F10.7 and Group Number\nproxies. We now have two choices: (1) the Sun underwent a dramatic change in\nhow its magnetic field drives variation of TSI or (2) the New Consensus TSI\nreconstruction does not work and the new dataset is premature and not useful\nneither for solar nor for climate research. Following David Hume, we should\nalways believe whatever would be the lesser miracle, which in our case would be\nchoice (2).",

The phase function of Ceres shows appreciably strong scattering\naround 90$^\\circ$ phase angle that cannot be fitted with a single-term HG SPPF,\nsuggesting possible stronger forward scattering than other asteroids previously\nanalyzed with spacecraft data. We speculate that such a scattering\ncharacteristic of Ceres might be related to its unique surface composition. We\ngrouped the reflectance data into a 1$^\\circ$ latitude-longitude grid and\nfitted each grid independently to study the spatial variations of photometric\nproperties. The albedo and color maps are consistent with previous studies. The\nSPPF over the surface of Ceres shows stronger backscattering associated with\nlower albedo and vice versa, consistent with the general trend among asteroids.\nThe Hapke roughness parameter does not vary much across the surface of Ceres,\nexcept for the ancient Vendimia Planitia region that has a slightly higher\nroughness.

Points raised by\nWright et al. during peer review and in recent publications are also addressed.\nThe response here presents issues of broad interest to the planetary science\ncommunity. W2018 acknowledges some of the most serious issues identified by\nMyhrvold, including the importance of Kirchhoff's law and the misrepresentation\nof diameters copied from previous radar, occultation, and spacecraft\nobservations as NEOWISE thermal modeling results. W2018 confirms copying ROS\ndiameters for 117 asteroids but does not report actual modeled diameters or the\nidentity of the asteroids involved. W2018 confirms that many NEOWISE \"fit\"\ncurves do not pass near the data points they claimed to fit. W2018 reveals more\nserious problems with NEOWISE results than had previously been understood.\nWright et al. belatedly disclose a software bug, found and corrected in 2011,\nthat apparently corrupted the vast majority of NEOWISE results, which have yet\nto be corrected. W2018 asserts that the bug had rare and small impacts on\nresults but elsewhere provides analysis that directly contradicts this claim.\nWe learn from W2018 that H values used by NEOWISE were not taken from the\nliterature, as claimed, but rather derived by fitting data, a method\ninconsistent with prior NEOWISE papers and practice in thermal modeling. The\nsystematic underestimation of WISE observation errors shown in Myhrvold 2018b\nis confirmed with a new analysis of repeated observation of calibration stars.\nEach argument in W2018 is shown here to be mistaken. Ultimately, W2018 reveals\nwhy the results of the empirical examination that Myhrvold published were\nimportant.",

An amplitude\nspectrum of the star demonstrates a rich content of g-modes between 102 and 496\n{\\mu}Hz as well as a few p-modes above 2000 {\\mu}Hz. In total, we found 110\nfrequencies. The g-mode region contains 104 frequencies, while the p-mode\nregion contains just six, altogether indicating the hybrid nature of KIC\n10001893. The main goal of our analysis was to identify the detected modes and\nto find some features, which will significantly help modeling of the star. We\nfound no multiplets, which points at a pole-on orientation, however, we defined\nmodal degrees and relative radial orders using asymptotic period spacing.\nEventually, we assigned 32 dipole l = 1 and 18 quadrupole l = 2 modes. The most\nremarkable feature we found are trapped modes, which are clearly seen in a\nreduce period diagram. It is the first time that three trapped modes are\ndetected in one pulsating sdB star. Since the more trapped modes we find, the\nbetter sounding of the stellar interior we can do, this feature provides\nimportant constraints on the physical structure of the star. Mode trapping is\nlikely caused by the He-H transition region and therefore it provides crucial\nconstraints for making realistic theoretical models of hot subdwarfs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The science operations of the LISA Pathfinder mission has demonstrated the\nfeasibility of sub-femto-g free-fall of macroscopic test masses necessary to\nbuild a LISA-like gravitational wave observatory in space. While the main focus\nof interest, i.e. the optical axis or the $x$-axis, has been extensively\nstudied, it is also of interest to evaluate the stability of the spacecraft\nwith respect to all the other degrees of freedom. The current paper is\ndedicated to such a study, with a focus set on an exhaustive and quantitative\nevaluation of the imperfections and dynamical effects that impact the stability\nwith respect to its local geodesic. A model of the complete closed-loop system\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of each part of the in-loop coordinates\nspectra. As will be presented, this model gives very good agreements with LISA\nPathfinder flight data. It allows one to identify the physical noise source at\nthe origin and the physical phenomena underlying the couplings. From this, the\nperformances of the stability of the spacecraft, with respect to its geodesic,\nare extracted as a function of frequency. Close to $1 mHz$, the stability of\nthe spacecraft on the $X_{SC}$, $Y_{SC}$ and $Z_{SC}$ degrees of freedom is\nshown to be of the order of $5.0\\ 10^{-15} m\\ s^{-2}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ for X and $4.0\n\\ 10^{-14} m\\ s^{-2}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ for Y and Z. For the angular degrees of\nfreedom, the values are of the order $3\\ 10^{-12} rad\\ s^{-2}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ for\n$\\Theta_{SC}$ and $3\\ 10^{-13} rad\\ s^{-2}/\\sqrt{Hz}$ for $H_{SC}$ and\n$\\Phi_{SC}$.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Long periods of strong southward magnetic fields are known to be the primary\ncause of intense geomagnetic storms. The majority of such events are caused by\nthe passage over Earth of a magnetic ejecta. Irrespective of the interplanetary\ncause, fast-forward shocks often precede such strong southward B$_{z}$ periods.\nHere, we first look at all long periods of strong southward magnetic fields as\nwell as fast-forward shocks measured by the \\textit{Wind} spacecraft in a\n22.4-year span. We find that 76{\\%} of strong southward B$_{z}$ periods are\npreceded within 48 hours by at least a fast-forward shock but only about 23{\\%}\nof all shocks are followed within 48 hours by strong southward B$_{z}$ periods.\nThen, we devise a threshold-based probabilistic forecasting method based on the\nshock properties and the pre-shock near-Earth solar wind plasma and\ninterplanetary magnetic field characteristics adopting a `superposed epoch\nanalysis'-like approach. Our analysis shows that the solar wind conditions in\nthe 30 minutes interval around the arrival of fast-forward shocks have a\nsignificant contribution to the prediction of long-duration southward B$_{z}$\nperiods. This probabilistic model may provide on average a 14-hour warning time\nfor an intense and long-duration southward B$_{z}$ period. Evaluating the\nforecast capability of the model through a statistical and skill score-based\napproach reveals that it outperforms a coin-flipping forecast. By using the\ninformation provided by the arrival of a fast-forward shock at L1, this model\nrepresents a marked improvement over similar forecasting methods. We outline a\nnumber of future potential improvements.",

In\norder to plan the optimum flyby sequence the NH mission planners needed to\nlearn as much as possible about the target in advance of the encounter.\nSpecifically, from lightcurve data, encounter timing could be adjusted to\naccommodate a highly elongated, binary, or rapidly rotating target. HST\nastrometric (Porter et al. 2018) and stellar occultation (Buie et al. 2018)\nobservations constrained MU69's orbit and diameter (21-41 km for an albedo of\n0.15-0.04), respectively. Photometry from the astrometric dataset suggested a\nvariability of $\\ge$0.3 mags, but they did not determine the period or provide\nshape information. We strategically spaced 24 HST orbits over 9 days to\ninvestigate rotation periods from approximately 2-100 hours and to better\nconstrain the lightcurve amplitude. Until NH detected MU69 in its optical\nnavigation images beginning in August 2018, this HST campaign provided the most\naccurate photometry to date. The mean variation in our data is 0.15 mags which\nsuggests that MU69 is either nearly spherical (a:b axis ratio of 1:1.15), or\nits pole vector is pointed near the line of sight to Earth; this interpretation\ndoes not preclude a near-contact binary or bi-lobed object. However, image\nstacks do conclude that MU69 does not have a binary companion $\\ge$2000 km with\na sensitivity to 29th magnitude. We report with confidence that MU69 is not\nboth rapidly rotating and highly elongated. We note that our results are\nconsistent with the fly-by imagery and orientation of MU69 (Stern et al. 2019).\nThe combined dataset also suggests that within the KBO lightcurve literature\nthere are likely other objects which share a geometric configuration like MU69\nresulting in an underestimate of the contact binary fraction for the CC Kuiper\nBelt.",

We find\nthat the photometric colors of all eight objects are red, typical of the Cold\nClassical dynamical population within which most reside. Because 2014 MU69 has\na similar color to that of other KBOs in the Cold Classical region of the\nKuiper Belt, it may be possible to use the upcoming high-resolution New\nHorizons observations of 2014 MU69 to draw conclusions about the greater Cold\nClassical population. Additionally, HST found none of these KBOs to be binary\nwithin separations of ~0.06 arcsec (~2000 km at 44 AU range) and {\\Delta}m less\nthan or equal to 0.5. This conclusion is consistent with the lower fraction of\nbinaries found at relatively wide separations.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space weathering is an important surface process occurring on the Moon and\nother airless bodies, especially those that have no magnetic field. The optical\neffects of the Moon's space weathering have been largely investigated in the\nlaboratory for lunar samples and lunar analogues. However, duplication of the\npristine regolith on Earth is not possible. Here we report the space weathering\nfrom the unique perspective of the Chang'E-3's (CE-3) \"Yutu\" rover, building on\nour previous work (Wang et al. 2017; Wu and Hapke 2018). Measurement of the\nvisually undisturbed uppermost regolith as well as locations that have been\naffected by rocket exhaust from the spacecraft by the Visible-Near Infrared\nSpectrometer (VNIS) revealed that the returned samples bring a biased\ninformation about the pristine lunar regolith. The uppermost surficial regolith\nis much more weathered than the regolith immediately below, and the finest\nfraction is rich in space weathered products. These materials are very dark and\nattenuated throughout the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths, hence\nreduce the reflectance and mask the absorption features. The effects on the\nspectral slope caused by space weathering are wavelength-dependent: the visible\nand near-infrared continuum slope (VNCS) increases while the visible slope (VS)\ndecreases. In the visible wavelength, the optical effects of space weathering\nand TiO2 are identical: both reduce albedo and blue the spectra. This suggests\nthat developing new TiO2 abundance algorithm is needed. Optical maturity\nindices are composition related and hence only locally meaningful. Since\noptical remote sensing can only sense the uppermost few microns of regolith and\nsince this surface tends to be very weathered, the interpretation of surface\ncomposition using optical remote sensing data needs to be carefully evaluated.\nSampling the uppermost surface is suggested.",

There are no simple closed form\nsolutions to the general zero dynamics problem for nonlinear systems. A few\nalgorithms exist for determining the zero dynamics, but none is straightforward\nand all are difficult to apply to large dimensional problems. A Closed form\nsolution to the zero dynamics problem would motivate more usage of this\npowerful technique. The author presents here a simple algebraic methodology for\nthe normal form and zero dynamics calculation of a class of nonlinear systems,\nmostly found in dynamical mechanical systems. The solution is in closed form so\nthat application of the theorem presented is straight forward. As an\nillustration, the zero dynamics calculations for the complex dynamics of a\nflexible spacecraft is presented to demonstrate the simplicity and usefulness\nof the proposed closed form solution.\nKeywords: Control, Differential Geometry, Normal Form, Zero Dynamics,\nNonlinear Systems, Feedback Linearization, Attitude Dynamics, Flexible\nSpacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A crucial part of a space mission for very-long baseline interferometery\n(VLBI), which is the technique capable of providing the highest resolution\nimages in astronomy, is orbit determination of the mission's space radio\ntelescope(s). In order to successfully detect interference fringes that result\nfrom correlation of the signals recorded by a ground-based and a space-borne\nradio telescope, the propagation delays experienced in the near-Earth space by\nradio waves emitted by the source and the relativity effects on each\ntelescope's clock need to be evaluated, which requires accurate knowledge of\nposition and velocity of the space radio telescope. In this paper we describe\nour approach to orbit determination (OD) of the RadioAstron spacecraft of the\nRadioAstron space-VLBI mission. Determining RadioAstron's orbit is complicated\ndue to several factors: strong solar radiation pressure, a highly eccentric\norbit, and frequent orbit perturbations caused by the attitude control system.\nWe show that in order to maintain the OD accuracy required for processing\nspace-VLBI observations at cm-wavelengths it is required to take into account\nthe additional data on thruster firings, reaction wheel rotation rates, and\nattitude of the spacecraft. We also investigate into using the unique orbit\ndata available only for a space-VLBI spacecraft, i.e. the residual delays and\ndelay rates that result from VLBI data processing, as a means to evaluate the\nachieved OD accuracy. We present the results of the first experience of OD\naccuracy evaluation of this kind, using more than 5,000 residual values\nobtained as a result of space-VLBI observations performed over 7 years of the\nRadioAstron mission operations.",

Here, we take advantage of\nthe orbit of the Wind spacecraft that ventured to distances of up to 0.012\nastronomical units (au) from the Sun-Earth line during the years 2000 to 2002.\nCombined with measurements from ACE, which is in a tight halo orbit around L1,\nthe multipoint measurements allow us to investigate how the magnetic field\ninside magnetic ejecta (MEs) changes on scales of 0.005 - 0.012 au. We identify\n21 CMEs measured by these two spacecraft for longitudinal separations of 0.007\nau or more. We find that the time-shifted correlation between 30-minute\naverages of the non-radial magnetic field components measured at the two\nspacecraft is systematically above 0.97 when the separation is 0.008 au or\nless, but is on average 0.89 for greater separations. Overall, these newly\nanalyzed measurements, combined with 14 additional ones when the spacecraft\nseparation is smaller, point towards a scale length of longitudinal magnetic\ncoherence inside MEs of 0.25 - 0.35 au for the magnitude of the magnetic field\nbut 0.06 - 0.12 au for the magnetic field components. This finding raises\nquestions about the very nature of MEs. It also highlights the need for\nadditional \"mesoscale\" multi-point measurements of CMEs with longitudinal\nseparations of 0.01 - 0.2 au.",

The CRF consisted of a discrete circular ribbon with a\ndiameter of $\\sim$1$\\arcmin$ and a short inner ribbon observed in ultraviolet\n(UV), extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), soft X-ray (SXR), and especially in 17 GHz.\nThe peak time ($\\sim$04:58 UT) of the flare in 17 GHz coincided with that in UV\n1600 \u00c5 and SXR derivative as a hard X-ray proxy, implying the peak time of\nimpulsive energy deposition in the lower atmosphere. Shortly after the peak\ntime, converging motion and filling process in the flare loop were revealed in\nAIA 131 \u00c5 and two XRT filters (Be\\_thin and Be\\_med), which are clear\nevidence for chromospheric evaporation upflows.

We used the newly\nobtained optical light curves to improve the spin and shape model of Phaethon\nand to determine its surface physical properties derived by thermophysical\nmodeling. We also used the available astrometric observations of Phaethon,\nincluding those obtained by the Arecibo radar and the Gaia spacecraft, to\nconstrain the secular drift of the orbital semimajor axis. This constraint\nallowed us to estimate the bulk density by assuming that the drift is dominated\nby the Yarkovsky effect. We used the convex inversion model to derive the 3D\nshape model of Phaethon, and a detailed numerical approach for an accurate\nanalysis of the Yarkovsky effect. We obtained a unique solution for Phaethon's\npole orientation at $(318,-47)^{\\circ}$ ecliptic longitude and latitude\n(uncertainty of $5^{\\circ}$), and confirm the previously reported\nthermophysical properties ($D=5.1\\pm0.2$ km, $\\Gamma=600\\pm200$ SI). Phaethon\nhas a top-like shape with possible north-south asymmetry. The characteristic\nsize of the regolith grains is 1-2 cm. The orbit analysis reveals a secular\ndrift of the semimajor axis of $-(6.9\\pm1.9)\\times 10^{-4}$ au Myr$^{-1}$.

Phaethon's $\\rho$ is consistent\nwith typical values for large ($>100$ km) C-complex asteroids and supports its\nassociation with asteroid (2) Pallas.

We\nfirst select small flux ropes (SFRs) by eye whose duration is unambiguous and\nwhich were observed by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) or\nWind spacecraft during solar maximum years. We inquire into which analytical\ntechnique is physically most appropriate. We consider three models: (i) linear\nforce-free field ($\\bigtriangledown\\times$ B = $\\alpha (r) $ B) with a\nspecific, prescribed constant $\\alpha$ (Lundquist solution), and (ii) with\n$\\alpha$ as a free constant parameter (Lundquist-alpha solution), (iii) uniform\ntwist field (Gold-Hoyle solution). We retain only those cases where the impact\nparameter is less than one-half the FR radius, $R$, so the results should be\nrobust (29 cases). The SFR radii lie in the range [$\\sim$ 0.003, 0.059] AU.\nComparing results, we find that the Lundquist-alpha and uniform twist solutions\nyielded comparable and small normalized $\\chi^2$ values in most cases. We then\nuse Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction to analyze these events further. We then\nconsidered the twist per unit length, $\\tau$, both its profile through the FR\nand its absolute value. We find $\\tau$ to lie in the range [5.6, 34] turns/AU.\nThe GH model-derived $\\tau$ values are comparable to those obtained from GS\nreconstruction. We find that twist unit length ($L$) is inversely proportional\nto $R$, as $\\tau \\sim 0.17/R$. We combine MC and SFR results on $\\tau (R)$ and\ngive a relation which is approximately valid for both sets.

We obtain\nnew insights concerning the geometry and kinematics of CME-driven shocks in\nrelation to their heliospheric impacts from the optimal, multi-spacecraft\nobservations of the eruption. The shock, which together with the CME driver can\nbe tracked from the early stage to the outer corona, shows a large oblate\nstructure produced by the vast expansion of the ejecta. The expansion speeds of\nthe shock along the radial and lateral directions are much larger than the\ntranslational speed of the shock center, all of which increase during the flare\nrise phase, peak slightly after the flare maximum and then decrease. The near\nsimultaneous arrival of the CME-driven shock at the Earth and Mars, which are\nseparated by 156.6$^{\\circ}$ in longitude, is consistent with the dominance of\nexpansion over translation observed near the Sun.

It is assumed that the agents measure relative positions\nof each other with a non-zero, unknown constant sensor bias. The translational\ndynamics of the spacecraft is expressed in Euler-Lagrangian form. We propose a\nnovel distributed, model independent control law for synchronization of\nnetworked Euler Lagrange system with biased measurements. An adaptive control\nlaw is derived based on Lyapunov analysis to estimate the bias. The proposed\nalgorithm ensures that the velocities converge to that of leader exponentially\nwhile the positions converge to a bounded neighborhood of the leader positions.\nWe have assumed a connected leader-follower network of spacecraft.

In addition to\nthe known restrictions on the angle of propagation with respect to the\nfluctuation spectrum and the question on the wavenumber dependence of the\nfrequency in turbulence which we briefly review, we show that another\nrestriction concerns the inclusion or exclusion of turbulent fluctuations in\nthe velocity field. Taylor's hypothesis in application to magnetic (MHD)\nturbulence encounters its strongest barriers here. It is applicable to magnetic\nturbulence only when the turbulent velocity fluctuations can practically be\ncompletely neglected against the bulk flow speed. For low flow speeds the\ntransformation becomes rather involved.

Despite its importance, existing publications on artificial\nintelligence and interstellar travel are limited to cursory descriptions where\nlittle detail is given about the nature of the artificial intelligence. This\narticle explores the role of artificial intelligence for interstellar travel by\ncompiling use cases, exploring capabilities, and proposing typologies, system\nand mission architectures.

Given current levels of increase in computational\npower, a spacecraft with a similar computational power as the human brain would\nhave a mass from dozens to hundreds of tons in a 2050-2060 timeframe. Given\nthat the advent of the first interstellar missions and artificial general\nintelligence are estimated to be by the mid-21st century, a more in-depth\nexploration of the relationship between the two should be attempted, focusing\non neglected areas such as protecting the artificial intelligence payload from\nradiation in interstellar space and the role of artificial intelligence in\nself-replication.",

This is\nthe third paper in a series of three about the flow and filtering of the ISD.\nMethods. Micrometer- and sub-micrometer-sized dust particles are subject to\nsolar gravity and radiation pressure as well as to interactions with the\ninterplanetary magnetic field that result in a complex size-dependent flow\npattern of ISD in the planetary system. With high-resolution dynamical\nmodelling we study the time-resolved flux and mass distribution of ISD and the\nrequirements for detection of ISD near the Earth.\nResults. Along the Earth orbit the density, speed, and flow direction of ISD\ndepend strongly on the Earth's position and the size of the interstellar\ngrains. A broad maximum of the ISD flux (2x10^{-4}/m^2/s of particles with\nradii >~0.3\\mu m) occurs in March when the Earth moves against the ISD flow.\nDuring this time period the relative speed with respect to the Earth is highest\n(~60 km/s), whereas in September when the Earth moves with the ISD flow, both\nthe flux and the speed are lowest (<~10 km/s). The mean ISD mass flow on to the\nEarth is ~100 kg/year with the highest flux of ~3.5kg/day occurring for about 2\nweeks close to the end of the year when the Earth passes near the narrow\ngravitational focus region downstream from the Sun. The phase of the 22-year\nsolar wind cycle has a strong effect on the number density and flow of\nsub-micrometer-sized ISD particles. During the years of maximum electromagnetic\nfocussing (year 2031 +/- 3) there is a chance that ISD particles with sizes\neven below 0.1\\mu m can reach the Earth.\nConclusions.

Two\nphysical processes that are thought to be the dominant contributors to the\nbrightness surge are shadow hiding (SH) and coherent backscatter (CB). The\noccurrence of shadow hiding in planetary regoliths is self-evident, but it has\nproved difficult to unambiguously demonstrate CB from remote sensing\nobservations. One prediction of CB theory is the wavelength dependence of the\nOE angular width. The Dawn spacecraft observed the OE on the surface of dwarf\nplanet Ceres. We characterize the OE over the resolved surface, including the\nbright Cerealia Facula, and to find evidence for SH and/or CB. We analyze\nimages of the Dawn framing camera by means of photometric modeling of the phase\ncurve. We find that the OE of most of the investigated surface has very similar\ncharacteristics, with an enhancement factor of 1.4 and a FWHM of 3\u00b0 (broad\nOE). A notable exception are the fresh ejecta of the Azacca crater, which\ndisplay a very narrow brightness enhancement that is restricted to phase angles\n$< 0.5$\u00b0 (narrow OE); suggestively, this is in the range in which CB is\nthought to dominate. We do not find a wavelength dependence for the width of\nthe broad OE, and lack the data to investigate the dependence for the narrow\nOE. The prediction of a wavelength-dependent CB width is rather ambiguous. The\nzero-phase observations allow us to determine Ceres' visible geometric albedo\nas $p_V = 0.094 \\pm 0.005$. A comparison with other asteroids suggests that\nCeres' broad OE is typical for an asteroid of its spectral type, with\ncharacteristics that are primarily linked to surface albedo. Our analysis\nsuggests that CB may occur on the dark surface of Ceres in a highly localized\nfashion.",

Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively. These six patterns provide precise frequencies for another six\nfundamental normal modes inside Saturn, yielding what is now a complete\nsequence of fundamental sectoral normal modes with azimuthal wavenumbers from 2\nto 10. These frequencies should place strong constraints on Saturn's interior\nstructure and rotation rate, while the relative amplitudes of these waves\nshould help clarify how the corresponding normal modes are excited inside the\nplanet.",

Technically, the CubeSats would create a triangular Sagnac\ninterferometer with 140.000km roundtrip arm length, optimized to be sensitive\nto gravitational waves at frequencies between 10mHz and 2Hz. The nature of the\nSagnac measurement makes it almost insensitive to position error, enabling the\nuse of spacecrafts in ballistic trajectories. The light source and\nrecombination units of the interferometer are based on compact fibered\ntechnologies without bulk optics. A peak sensitivity of 23 pm/sqrt(Hz) is\nexpected at 1Hz assuming a 200mW internal laser source and 10-centimeter\ndiameter apertures.

In addition to the\nanticipated signals from many millions of binary systems, this band may contain\nnew and previously un-imagined sources for which we currently have no models.\nTo detect unmodeled and unexpected signals we need to be able to separate them\nfrom instrumental noise artifacts, or glitches. Glitches are a regular feature\nin the data from ground based laser interferometers, and they were also seen in\ndata from the LISA Pathfinder mission. In contrast to the situation on ground,\nwe will not have the luxury of having multiple independent detectors to help\nseparate unmodeled signals from glitches, and new techniques have to be\ndeveloped. Here we show that unmodeled gravitational wave bursts can be\ndetected with LISA by leveraging the different way in which instrument glitches\nand gravitational wave bursts imprint themselves in the time-delay\ninterferometery data channels. We show that for signals with periods longer\nthan the light travel time between the spacecraft, the \"breathing mode\" or\nSagnac data combination is key to detection. Conversely, for short period\nsignals it is the time of arrival at each spacecraft that aids separation. We\ninvestigate the conditions under which we can distinguish the origin of signals\nand glitches consisting of a single sine-Gaussian wavelet and determine how\nwell we can characterize the signal. We find that gravitational waves bursts\ncan be unambiguously detected and characterized with just a single data channel\n(four functioning laser links), though the signal separation and parameter\nestimation improve significantly when all six laser links are operational.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This study identifies the solar origins of magnetic clouds that are observed\nat 1 AU and predicts the helical handedness of these clouds from the solar\nsurface magnetic fields. We started with the magnetic clouds listed by the\nMagnetic Field Investigation (MFI) team supporting NASA's WIND spacecraft in\nwhat is known as the MFI table and worked backwards in time to identify solar\nevents that produced these clouds. Our methods utilize magnetograms from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) spacecraft so that we could only analyze MFI entries after\nthe beginning of 2011. This start date and the end date of the MFI table gave\nus 37 cases to study. Of these we were able to associate only eight surface\nevents with clouds detected by WIND at 1 AU. We developed a simple algorithm\nfor predicting the cloud helicity which gave the correct handedness in all\neight cases. The algorithm is based on the conceptual model that an ejected\nflux tube has two magnetic origination points at the positions of the strongest\nradial magnetic field regions of opposite polarity near the places where the\nejected arches end at the solar surface. We were unable to find events for the\nremaining 29 cases: lack of a halo or partial halo CME in an appropriate time\nwindow, lack of magnetic and/or filament activity in the proper part of the\nsolar disk, or the event was too far from disk center. The occurrence of a\nflare was not a requirement for making the identification but in fact flares,\noften weak, did occur for seven of the eight cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  CubeSats are excellent platforms to rapidly perform simple space experiments.\nSeveral hundreds of CubeSats have already been successfully launched in the\npast few years and the number of announced launches grows every year. These\nplatforms provide an easy access to space for universities and organizations\nwhich otherwise could not afford it. However, these spacecraft still rely on RF\ncommunications, where the spectrum is already crowded and cannot support the\ngrowing demand for data transmission to the ground. Lasercom holds the promise\nto be the solution to this problem, with a potential improvement of several\norders of magnitude in the transmission capacity, while keeping a low size,\nweight and power. Between 2016 and 2017, The Keck Institute for Space Studies\n(KISS), a joint institute of the California Institute of Technology and the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, brought together a group of space scientists and\nlasercom engineers to address the current challenges that this technology\nfaces, in order to enable it to compete with RF and eventually replace it when\nhigh-data rate is needed. After two one-week workshops, the working group\nstarted developing a report addressing three study cases: low Earth orbit,\ncrosslinks and deep space. This paper presents the main points and conclusions\nof these KISS workshops.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a refined statistical analysis based on interplanetary coronal\nmass ejections as well as co-rotating interaction regions for the time period\n2003-2015 to estimate the impact of different solar wind types on the\ngeomagnetic activity and the neutral density in the Earth's thermosphere. For\nthe time-based delimitation of the events, we rely on the catalog maintained by\nRichardson and Cane and the CIR-lists provided by S. Vennerstroem and Jian et\nal. [2011]. These archives are based on in-situ measurements from the ACE\nand/or the Wind spacecraft. On this basis, we thoroughly investigated 196\nEarth-directed ICME and 195 CIR events. To verify the impact on the Earth's\nthermosphere we determined neutral mass densities by using accelerometer\nmeasurements collected by the low-Earth orbiting satellites GRACE and CHAMP.\nSubsequently, the atmospheric densities are related to characteristic ICME\nparameters. In this process a new calibration method has been examined. Since\nincreased solar activity may lead to a decrease of the satellites orbital\naltitude we additionally assessed the orbital decay for each of the events and\nsatellites. The influence of CIR events is in the same range of magnitude as\nthe majority of the ICMEs (186 out of 196). Even though, the extended\ninvestigation period between 2011 and 2015 has a lack of extreme solar events\nthe combined analysis reveals comparable correlation coefficients between the\nneutral densities and the various ICME and geomagnetic parameters (mostly >\n0.85). The evaluation of orbit decay rates at different altitudes revealed a\nhigh dependency on the satellite actual altitude.",
