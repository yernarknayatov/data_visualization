    "abstract": "Abstract:  The local interstellar spectra (LIS) for cosmic rays at energies below about\n30 GeV/nuc are increasingly obscured from view at Earth by solar modulation,\nthe lower the energy. These charged particles encounter significant changes in\nthe heliosphere, over an 11-year cycle, which include processes such as\nconvection, diffusion, adiabatic energy losses and gradient, curvature and\ncurrent sheet drifts. Particle drifts cause chargesign dependent modulation and\na 22-year cycle, adding complexity to determining the respective very LIS from\nobservations only at Earth. However, with measurements now made by the Voyager\n1 spacecraft in the vicinity of the heliopause, it is possible to determine a\nvery LIS for galactic electrons between about 5 MeV and about 120 MeV. At these\nlow energies also galactic protons observed in the outer heliosphere had been\ncompletely obscured by the so-call anomalous component which is accelerated\ninside the heliosheath. Since August 2012, these anomalous cosmic rays are\nsubstantially depleted at Voyager 1 so that also for cosmic ray ions it is now\npossible to obtain a lower limit to their very LIS. Combining numerical\nmodelling of solar modulation with the accurate measurements by the PAMELA\nmission and with Voyager observations, the lower limit of the very LIS for\nelectrons, protons and helium, and other ions, can be determined from about 5\nMeV and above. These spectra are called heliopause spectra, considered to be\nthe lowest possible very LIS. Also from an astrophysics point of view, the\ndetermination of what can be called a very LIS, not just an averaged galactic\nspectrum, is encouraging. The mentioned aspects are discussed, focussing on a\ncomparison of recent heliospheric observations and corresponding solar\nmodulation modelling.",

Computations are compared to\nspacecraft observations in the inner and outer heliosphere. It is shown that\nthe model produces cosmic ray proton intensities compatible to different\nspacecraft observations on a global scale, at Earth and along both Voyager\nspacecraft trajectories. The study reveals that when the same modulation\nparameters, which resulted in compatible intensities along Voyager 1, were\nassumed along the Voyager 2 trajectory, the model failed to reproduce the\nobservations. The study also found that any change in diffusion parameters\nalone could not reproduce the cosmic ray observations along Voyager 2 so that\nchanges to the heliospheric geometry were necessary i.e the computed\nintensities along both Voyager trajectories suggest that the heliosphere is\nasymmetric. Furthermore, $E >$ 70 MeV and 133-242 MeV proton intensities along\nVoyager 1 and 2 trajectories are predicted from end of 2012 onwards. It is\nshown that the computed intensities along Voyager 1 increase with an almost\nconstant rate up to the heliopause. However, the model shows that Voyager 2 is\nstill under the influence of temporal solar activity changes because of its\nrelatively large distance to the heliopause. Along the Voyager 2 trajectory,\nthe intensities remained generally constant for some time and should soon start\nto increase steadily.",

By\nintroducing recent theoretical advances in the transport coefficients in the\nmodel, computed intensities are compared with Voyager 1, International\nMonitoring Platform (IMP) 8, and Ulysses proton observations in search of\ncompatibility. The effect of different modulation parameters on computed\nintensities is also illustrated.

A modified time dependence in the diffusion coefficients is\nproposed to improve compatibility with the observations at Earth after ~2004.\nThis modified time dependence led to an improved compatibility between computed\nintensities and the observations along the Voyager 1 trajectory and at Earth\neven after ~2004. An interesting result is that the cosmic-ray modulation\nduring the present polarity cycle is not determined only by changes in the\ndrift coefficient and tilt angle of the wavy current sheet, but is also largely\ndependent on changes in the diffusion coefficients.",

We present a detailed disk-integrated and disk-resolved\nphotometric analysis using the Framing Camera images with the Minnaert model\nand the Hapke model, and report our results about the global photometric\nproperties of Vesta. The photometric properties of Vesta show weak or no\ndependence on wavelengths, except for the albedo. At 554 nm, the global average\ngeometric albedo of Vesta is 0.38+/-0.04, and the Bond albedo range is\n0.20+/-0.02. The bolometric Bond albedo is 0.18+/-0.01. The phase function of\nVesta is similar to those of S-type asteroids. Vesta's surface shows a\nsingle-peaked albedo distribution with a full-width-half-max ~17% relative to\nthe global average. This width is much smaller than the full range of albedos\n(from ~0.55x to >2x global average) in localized bright and dark areas of a few\ntens of km in sizes, and is probably a consequence of significant regolith\nmixing on the global scale. Rheasilvia basin is about 10% brighter than the\nglobal average. The phase reddening of Vesta measured from Dawn Framing Camera\nimages is comparable or slightly stronger than that of Eros as measured by the\nNear Earth Asteroid Rendezvous mission, but weaker than previous measurements\nbased on ground-based observations of Vesta and laboratory measurements of HED\nmeteorites. The photometric behaviors of Vesta are best described by the Hapke\nmodel and the Akimov disk- function, when compared with the Minnaert model,\nLommel-Seeliger model, and Lommel- Seeliger-Lambertian model.

This is particularly true for\nground-based interferometric detectors, like LIGO, space-based detectors, like\nLISA and its derivatives, spacecraft doppler tracking detectors, and pulsar\ntiming arrays detectors. The description of gravitational waves, and a\ngravitational wave detector's response, to the unphysical metric perturbation\nhas lead to a proliferation of false analogies and descriptions regarding how\nthese detectors function, and true misunderstandings of the physical character\nof gravitational waves.\nHere we provide a fully physical and gauge invariant description of the\nresponse of a wide class of gravitational wave detectors in terms of the\nRiemann curvature, the physical quantity that describes gravitational phenomena\nin general relativity. In the limit of high frequency gravitational waves, the\nRiemann curvature separates into two independent gauge invariant quantities: a\n\"background\" curvature contribution and a \"wave\" curvature contribution. In\nthis limit the gravitational wave contribution to the detector response reduces\nto an integral of the gravitational wave contribution of the curvature along\nthe unperturbed photon path between components of the detector. The description\npresented here provides an unambiguous physical description of what a\ngravitational wave detector measures and how it operates, a simple means of\ncomputing corrections to a detectors response owing to general detector motion,\na straightforward way of connecting the results of numerical relativity\nsimulations to gravitational wave detection, and a basis for a general and\nfully relativistic pulsar timing formula.",

It\nwas the target of an extensive observing campaign and was visited by the Deep\nImpact spacecraft (mission EPOXI). We present observations of HCN and CH3OH\nemission lines conducted with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer on 22-23,\n28 October and 4, 5 November 2010 at 1.1, 1.9 and 3.4 mm wavelengths. The\nthermal emission from the dust coma and nucleus is detected simultaneously.\nInterferometric images with unprecedented spatial resolution are obtained. A\nsine-wave variation of the thermal continuum is observed in the 23 October\ndata, that we associate with the nucleus thermal light curve. The nucleus\ncontributes up to 30-55 % of the observed continuum. The large dust-to-gas\nratio (in the range 2-6) can be explained by the unusual activity of the comet\nfor its size, which allows decimeter size particles and large boulders to be\nentrained by the gas. The rotational temperature of CH3OH is measured. We\nattribute the increase from 35 to 46 K with increasing beam size (from 150 to\n1500 km) to radiative processes. The HCN production rate displays strong\nrotation-induced variations. The HCN production curve, as well as those of CO2\nand H2O measured by EPOXI, are interpreted with a geometric model which takes\ninto account the rotation and the shape of the comet. The HCN and H2O\nproduction curves are in phase, showing common sources. The 1.7h delay, in\naverage, of HCN and H2O with respect to the CO2 production curve suggests that\nHCN and H2O are mainly produced by subliming icy grains. The scale length of\nproduction of HCN is determined to be on the order of 500-1000 km, implying a\nmean velocity of 100-200 m/s for the icy grains producing HCN. The modulation\nof the CO2 prouction and of the velocity offset of the HCN lines are\ninterpreted in terms of localized sources of gas on the nucleus surface.",

Here, we look at the differences in the\nlow-degree oscillation p-mode frequencies between radial velocity and intensity\nmeasurements taking into account all the known features of the p-mode profiles\n(e.g., the opposite peak asymmetry), and of the power spectrum (e.g., the\npresence of the higher degrees l= 4 and 5 in the signal). We show that the\nintensity frequencies are higher than the velocity frequencies during the solar\ncycle with a clear temporal dependence. The response between the individual\nangular degrees is also different. Time delays are observed between the\ntemporal variations in GOLF and VIRGO frequencies. Such analysis is important\nin order to put new constraints and to better understand the mechanisms\nresponsible for the temporal variations of the oscillation frequencies with the\nsolar magnetic activity as well as their height dependences in the solar\natmosphere. It is also important for the study of the stellar magnetic activity\nusing asteroseismic data.",

In this paper we present the\nmetrology and the pseudo stellar sources sub-systems, we present a performance\nmodel and an error budget of the experiment and we report the present status of\nthe demonstration. Finally we also present our first results: the experiment\nhad its first light in July 2013 and a first set of data was taken in air.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  By surveying new fields for the shortest-period \"big\" planets, the Kepler\nspacecraft could provide the statistics to more clearly measure the occurrence\ndistributions of giant and medium planets. This would allow separate\ndeterminations for giant and medium planets of the relationship between the\ninward rate of tidal migration of planets and the strength of the stellar tidal\ndissipation (as expressed by the tidal quality factor Q). We propose a \"Hot Big\nPlanets Survey\" to find new big planets to better determine the planet\noccurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler\nwill be able to find as \"big\", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of\ngiant and medium planets (above and below 8 earth radii). The distribution of\nplanets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period\ngiant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration,\nlikely from scattering from further out. The numbers of planets at these short\nperiods is still small, leaving uncertainty over the result that the\ndistribution shows the expected power index for inward tidal migration. The\ncurrent statistics make it hard to say whether the presence of more giant\nplanets at the shortest periods despite there being more medium planets at most\nperiods indicates a greater migration of giant than medium planets. We propose\na repurposed Kepler mission to make enough 45-day observations to survey 10\ntimes as many stars as in the survey of the original field, to survey for\nplanets with periods of up to fifteen days with at least three transits.

Now is an excellent time to fill this hole in\nmission capacity and to focus on the metal factories of the Universe, for which\nstellar evolution theory is least adequate.\nOur white paper aims to remedy major shortcomings in the theory of stellar\nstructure and evolution of the most massive stars by focusing on a large\nensemble of stars in a carefully selected young open cluster. Cluster\nasteroseismology of very young stars such as those of NGC2244 has the major\nadvantage that all cluster stars have similar age, distance and initial\nchemical composition, implying drastic restrictions for the stellar modeling\ncompared to asteroseismology of single isolated stars with very different ages\nand metallicities.\nOur study requires long-term photometric measurements of stars with visual\nmagnitude ranging from 6.5 to 15 in a large FoV with a precision better than 30\nppm for the brightest cluster members (magnitude below 9) up to 500 ppm for the\nfainter ones, which is well achievable with 2-Wheel Kepler, in combination with\nhigh-precision high-resolution spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry of the\nbrightest pulsating cluster members.

By carefully processing and combining multiple SWAP images it is\npossible to produce low-noise composites that reveal the structure of the EUV\ncorona to relatively large heights.

In this paper we use the resulting images to conduct the first\never study of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the corona observed\nin the EUV over a three-year period that includes the complete rise phase of\nsolar cycle 24. Of particular note is the persistence over many solar rotations\nof bright, diffuse features composed of open magnetic field that overlie polar\ncrown filaments and extend to large heights above the solar surface.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of NEOKepler using a\ndouble \"fence post\" survey pattern that efficiently detects PHOs. In a\nsimulated 12-month survey, we estimate that NEOKepler would detect ~150 new\nNEOs with absolute magnitudes of less than 21.5, ~50 of which would be new\nPHOs. This would increase the annual PHO discovery rate by at least 50% and\nimprove upon our goal of discovering 90% of PHOs by the end of 2020. Due to its\nheliocentric orbit, Kepler would also be sensitive to objects inside Earth's\norbit, discovering more objects in its first year than are currently known to\nexist. Understanding this undersampled sub-population of NEOs will reveal new\ninsights into the actual PHO distribution by further constraining current NEO\nmodels.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  As a response to the Kepler white paper call, we propose to keep Kepler\npointing to its current field of view and continue observing thousands of large\namplitude variables (Cepheid, RR Lyrae and delta Scuti stars among others) with\nhigh cadence in the Kep-Cont Mission. The degraded pointing stability will\nstill allow observation of these stars with reasonable (better than millimag)\nprecision. The Kep-Cont mission will allow studying the nonradial modes in\nBlazhko-modulated and first overtone RR Lyrae stars and will give a better view\non the period jitter of the only Kepler Cepheid in the field. With continued\ncontinuous observation of the Kepler RR Lyrae sample we may get closer to the\norigin of the century-old Blazhko problem. Longer time-span may also uncover\nnew dynamical effects like apsidal motion in eclipsing binaries. A continued\nmission will have the advantage of providing unprecedented, many-years-long\nhomogeneous and continuous photometric data of the same targets. We investigate\nthe pragmatic details of such a mission and find a number of advantages,\nespecially the minimal need of reprogramming of the flight software. Another\nundeniable advantage of the current field of view is the completed, ongoing and\nplanned ground-based follow-up observations and allocated telescope times\nfocusing on the current field. We emphasize that while we propose this\ncontinuation as an independent mission, we can easily share slots with e.g.\nplanetary mission with a strong belief that both (or more) communities can\nstill benefit from Kepler's current capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type and\nred-giant stars in a 2-wheel Kepler Mission. Our main conclusion is that by\ntargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-quality\nasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointing\nperformance are met. Targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate unique\nscience that was not possible in the nominal Mission, notably from the study of\nclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the Kepler field. Our\nconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a space\nphotometry simulator, with information provided by the Kepler Project used as\ninput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. We find that elevated levels\nof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have a\nsignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies of\nsolar-like oscillators in the Kepler field. However, the situation may be much\nmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resets\nof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reaction\nwheels are accurate at the < 1 arcsec level. This would make it possible to\napply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometric\nprecision. Without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing it\nrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the Kepler-field\ncase. Critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level of\npointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). We suggest\nthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail and\ndata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer our\nassistance in this work.",

These planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on a\ntransiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between the\nEarth-sized WD and its Earth-sized planets. The JWST is capable of obtaining\nthe first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known\nplanets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability\nof the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that\nis capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We\npropose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS\nimaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large\nfield of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs\ncan be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.\nOur proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will\nfind up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain\nKepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With\nfew-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a\ncompletely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is\nsensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and\nsubstellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the\ndouble WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the\ngravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our\ntargets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit\nfrom high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit\nsurvey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby M dwarfs or\nasteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae) in the same fields.",

It was launched in 2002 and\nsince then the BGO detectors of the Anti-Coincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI\nspectrometer have detected many hard X-ray (HXR) bursts from the Sun, producing\nlightcurves at photon energies above ~ 100 keV. The spacecraft has a highly\nelliptical orbit, providing a long uninterrupted observing time (about 90% of\nthe orbital period) with nearly constant background due to the reduction of the\ncrossing time of the Earth's radiation belts. However, due to technical\nconstraints, INTEGRAL cannot point to the Sun and high-energy solar photons are\nalways detected in non-standard observation conditions. To make the data useful\nfor solar studies, we have undertaken a major effort to specify the observing\nconditions through Monte-Carlo simulations of the response of ACS for several\nselected flares. We check the performance of the model employed for the\nMonte-Carlo simulations using RHESSI observations for the same sample of solar\nflares. We conclude that, despite the fact that INTEGRAL was not designed to\nperform solar observations, ACS is a useful instrument in solar flare research.\nIn particular, its relatively large effective area allows the determination of\ngood-quality HXR/gamma-ray lightcurves for X- and M-class solar flares and, in\nsome cases, probably also for C-class flares.",

We also outline the modifications needed to flight\nsoftware in order allow for such observations to take place, aiming to provide\nample non-photometric data that should allow post-processing to recover most of\nthe pre-failure photometric performance. In total, the KeSeF Mission will allow\nKepler to follow up it's own previous discoveries in a way that is not\notherwise possible. By doing so it will enable to continue pursuing nearly all\nthe science goals that made the original mission choose staring at a single\nfield of view in the first place.",

Between 2008.0 and\n2012.3 when Voyager 1 went from about 105 to 120.5 AU the spectral intensities\nof these two components between about 30 and 500 MeV/nuc unfolded (increased)\nin a manner consistent with an average modulation potential decrease ~5 MV per\nAU as described by a Parker like cosmic ray transport in the heliosphere where\nthe overall modulation is described by a modulation potential in MV. Between\n120.5 and 121.7 AU, however, as a result of two sudden intensity increases\nstarting on May 8th and August 25th, 2012, this modulation potential decreased\nby ~80 MV and spectra resembling possible local interstellar spectra for H and\nHe were revealed. Considering these spectra to be the local interstellar\nspectra would imply that almost 1/3 of the total modulation potential of about\n270 MV required to explain the spectra of these components observed at the\nEarth must occur in just a 1 AU radial interval in the outer heliosheath. As a\nresult about ~80% of the total modulation potential observed at the Earth at\nthis time occurs in the heliosheath itself. The remaining 20% of the total\nmodulation occurs inside the heliospheric termination shock. The details of\nthese intensity changes and their description by a simple modulation model are\ndiscussed.",

This expression describes how this temperature ratio depends upon\nthe average velocity of the ions along the magnetic field direction and the\nratio of the parallel proton pressure to the magnetic pressure. We compare our\nmodel with previously published measurements of alpha particles and protons\nfrom the WIND spacecraft.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Observations of asteroid 4 Vesta by NASA's Dawn spacecraft are interesting\nbecause its surface has the largest range of albedo, color and composition of\nany other asteroid visited by spacecraft to date. These hemispherical and\nrotational variations in surface brightness and composition have been\nattributed to impact processes since Vesta's formation. Prior to Dawn's arrival\nat Vesta, its surface properties were the focus of intense telescopic\ninvestigations for nearly a hundred years. Ground-based photometric and\nspectroscopic observations first revealed these variations followed later by\nthose using Hubble Space Telescope. Here we compare interpretations of Vesta's\nrotation period, pole, albedo, topographic, color, and compositional properties\nfrom ground-based telescopes and HST with those from Dawn. Rotational spectral\nvariations observed from ground-based studies are also consistent with those\nobserved by Dawn. While the interpretation of some of these features was\ntenuous from past data, the interpretations were reasonable given the\nlimitations set by spatial resolution and our knowledge of Vesta and HED\nmeteorites at that time. Our analysis shows that ground-based and HST\nobservations are critical for our understanding of small bodies and provide\nvaluable support for ongoing and future spacecraft missions.",
