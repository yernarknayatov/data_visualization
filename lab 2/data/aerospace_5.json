In order to minimize the estimation\nerror at the centralized node, only a carefully selected subset of measurements\nshould be transmitted. We propose to select measurements based on the Fisher\ninformation matrix (FIM), as \"minimizing\" the inverse of the FIM is required to\nachieve small estimation error.\nSelecting measurements based on the FIM leads to a combinatorial optimization\nproblem. However, when the criteria used to select measurements is both\nmonotone and submodular it allows the use of a greedy algorithm that is\nguaranteed to be within $1-1/e\\approx63\\%$ of the optimum and has the critical\nbenefit of quadratic computational complexity. To illustrate this concept, we\nderive the FIM criterion for different sensor types to which we apply FIM-based\nmeasurement selection.

Expressing such requirements is challenging, because of (1) the\nmany features that can be used to characterize a signal behavior; (2) the broad\nvariation in expressiveness of the specification languages (i.e., temporal\nlogics) used for defining signal-based temporal properties.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Among the mitigation measures introduced to cope with the space debris issue\nthere is the de-orbiting of decommissioned satellites. Guidelines for\nre-entering objects call for a ground casualty risk no higher than 0.0001. To\ncomply with this requirement, satellites can be designed through a\ndesign-for-demise philosophy. Still, a spacecraft designed to demise has to\nsurvive the debris-populated space environment for many years. The demisability\nand the survivability of a satellite can both be influenced by a set of common\ndesign choices such as the material selection, the geometry definition, and the\nposition of the components. Within this context, two models have been developed\nto analyse the demise and the survivability of satellites. Given the competing\nnature of the demisability and the survivability, a multi-objective\noptimisation framework was developed, with the aim to identify trade-off\nsolutions for the preliminary design of satellites. As the problem is nonlinear\nand involves the combination of continuous and discrete variables, classical\nderivative based approaches are unsuited and a genetic algorithm was selected\ninstead. The genetic algorithm uses the developed demisability and\nsurvivability criteria as the fitness functions of the multi-objective\nalgorithm. The paper presents a test case, which considers the preliminary\noptimisation of tanks in terms of material, geometry, location, and number of\ntanks for a representative Earth observation mission. The configuration of the\nexternal structure of the spacecraft is fixed. Tanks were selected because they\nare sensitive to both design requirements: they represent critical components\nin the demise process and impact damage can cause the loss of the mission\nbecause of leaking and ruptures. The results present the possible trade off\nsolutions, constituting the Pareto front obtained from the multi-objective\noptimisation.",

Common orbit\ndetermination process noise techniques, such as state noise compensation and\ndynamic model compensation, require offline tuning and a priori knowledge of\nthe dynamical environment. Alternatively, the process noise covariance can be\nestimated through adaptive filtering. However, many adaptive filtering\ntechniques are not applicable to onboard orbit determination due to\ncomputational cost or the assumption of a linear time-invariant system.\nFurthermore, existing adaptive filtering techniques do not constrain the\nprocess noise covariance according to the underlying continuous-time dynamical\nmodel, and there has been limited work on adaptive filtering with colored\nprocess noise. To overcome these limitations, a novel approach is developed\nwhich optimally fuses state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation\nwith covariance matching adaptive filtering. This yields two adaptive and\ndynamically constrained process noise covariance estimation techniques. Unlike\nmany adaptive filtering approaches, the new techniques accurately extrapolate\nover measurement outages and do not rely on ad hoc methods to ensure the\nprocess noise covariance is positive semi-definite. The benefits of the\nproposed algorithms are demonstrated through two case studies: an illustrative\nlinear system and the autonomous navigation of two spacecraft orbiting an\nasteroid.",

However, many Engineering\nThermodynamics textbooks at home and abroad focus only on evaluating the\nthermal efficiency of gas power cycle, while the important concept of specific\ncycle net work is ignored. Taking an ideal Otto cycle and an ideal Brayton as\nexamples, the optimum compression ratio (or the pressure ratio) and the maximum\nspecific cycle net work are analyzed and determined. The ideal Otto and the\nideal Brayton cycles, and also other gas power cycles, are concluded that the\noperation under the optimum compression/pressure ratio of the engine, instead\nof under the higher efficiency, is more economic and more reasonable. We\nconcluded that the two very important concepts, i.e., the maximum specific\ncycle net work and the optimum compression (or pressure) ratio for the gas\npower cycles, should be emphasized in the Engineering Thermodynamics teaching\nprocess and the latter revised or the newly edited textbooks, in order to\nbetter guide the engineering applications. In the end, general T-s diagram is\nproposed for the gas power cycles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  High altitude balloons (HABs) are typically tracked via GPS data sent via\nreal-time radio-based communication systems such as the Automated Packet\nReporting System (APRS). Prefabricated APRS-compatible tracker modules have\nmade it trivial to transmit GPS coordinates and payload parameters in\ncompliance with the requisite AX.25 protocol. However, in order to receive and\ntrack APRS signals, conventional methodologies call for the use of a Very High\nFrequency (VHF) receiver to demodulate signals transmitted on the 440/144 MHz\nAPRS frequencies, along with a compatible antenna and custom methodology for\nvisualizing the HAB's location on a map. The entire assembly is typically\ncostly, cumbersome, and may require an internet connection in order to obtain\nreal-time visualization of the HAB's location. This paper describes a low-cost,\nhandheld system based on open-source software that operates independently of an\ninternet connection. The miniaturized system is suited to tracking done either\nfrom a vehicle or on foot, and is cost-effective enough to be within the means\nof nearly any HAB user. The paper also discusses preliminary test results and\nfurther applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The requirement to generate robust robotic platforms is a critical enabling\nstep to allow such platforms to permeate safety-critical applications (i.e.,\nthe localization of autonomous platforms in urban environments). One of the\nprimary components of such a robotic platform is the state estimation engine,\nwhich enables the platform to reason about itself and the environment based\nupon sensor readings. When such sensor readings are degraded traditional state\nestimation approaches are known to breakdown. To overcome this issue, several\nrobust state estimation frameworks have been proposed. One such method is the\nbatch covariance estimation (BCE) framework. The BCE approach enables robust\nstate estimation by iteratively updating the measurement error uncertainty\nmodel through the fitting of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the measurement\nresiduals. This paper extends upon the BCE approach by arguing that the\nuncertainty estimation process should be augmented to include metadata (e.g.,\nthe signal strength of the associated GNSS observation). The modification of\nthe uncertainty estimation process to an augmented data space is significant\nbecause it increases the likelihood of a unique partitioning in the measurement\nresidual domain and thus provides the ability to more accurately characterize\nthe measurement uncertainty model. The proposed batch covariance estimation\nover an augmented data-space (BCE-AD) is experimentally validated on collected\ndata where it is shown that a significant increase in state estimation accuracy\ncan be granted compared to previously proposed robust estimation techniques.",

Current\napproaches treat the interaction between these two states of matter either in a\ndecoupled manner or through one-way coupled 'co-simulation'. In this paper a\nmethodology for multiphysics simulations of two-way interaction between\nlightning and elastoplastic materials is presented, which can inherently\ncapture the non-linear feedback between these two states of matter. This is\nachieved by simultaneously solving the magnetohydrodynamic and the\nelastoplastic systems of equations on the same computational mesh, evolving the\nmagnetic and electric fields dynamically. The resulting model allows for the\ntopological evolution and movement of the arc attachment point coupled to the\nstructural response and Joule heating of the substrate. The dynamic\ncommunication between the elastoplastic material and the plasma is facilitated\nby means of Riemann problem-based ghost fluid methods. This two-way coupling,\nto the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been previously demonstrated.\nThe proposed model is first validated against experimental laboratory studies,\ndemonstrating that the growth of the plasma arc can be accurately reproduced,\ndependent on the electrical conductivity of the substrate. It is then\nsubsequently evaluated in a setting where the dynamically-evolved properties\nwithin the substrate feed back into the plasma arc attachment. Results are\npresented for multi-layered substrates of different materials, and for a\nsubstrate with temperature-dependent electrical conductivity. It is\ndemonstrated that these conditions generate distinct behaviour due to the\ninteraction between the plasma arc and the substrate.",

Over half a century has witnessed great efforts\nin coping with the motion non-commutativity errors to accurately compute the\nnavigation information as far as possible, so as not to compromise the quality\nmeasurements of inertial sensors. Highly dynamic applications and the\nforthcoming cold-atom precision inertial navigation systems demand for even\nmore accurate inertial navigation computation. The paper gives birth to an\ninertial navigation algorithm to fulfill that demand, named the iNavFIter,\nwhich is based on a brand-new framework of functional iterative integration and\nChebyshev polynomials. Remarkably, the proposed iNavFIter reduces the\nnon-commutativity errors to almost machine precision, namely, the\nconing/sculling/scrolling errors that have perplexed the navigation community\nfor long. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate its accuracy\nsuperiority over the state-of-the-art inertial navigation algorithms at\naffordable computation cost.",

Such envelope variations are nonlinear and generally\nunpredictable by the pilot as they are governed by the aircraft's complex\ndynamics. Hence, in order to prevent in-flight Loss of Control it is crucial to\npractically predict the impaired aircraft's flight envelope variation due to\nany a-priori unknown failure degree. This paper investigates the predictability\nof the number of trim points within the maneuvering flight envelope and its\ncentroid using both linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation methods. To\ndo so, various polynomial models and nonlinear models based on hyperbolic\ntangent function are developed and compared which incorporate the influencing\nfactors on the envelope variations as the inputs and estimate the centroid and\nthe number of trim points of the maneuvering flight envelope at any intended\nfailure degree. Results indicate that both the polynomial and hyperbolic\ntangent function-based models are capable of predicting the impaired fight\nenvelope variation with good precision. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nregression equation of the best polynomial fit enables direct assessment of the\nimpaired aircraft's flight envelope contraction and displacement sensitivity to\nthe specific parameters characterizing aircraft failure and flight condition.",

However, because of the\na priori on the stationarity of the covariance matrix of classic Gaussian\nProcesses, this method may not be adapted for non-stationary functions involved\nin the optimization problem. To overcome this issue, a new Bayesian\nOptimization approach is proposed. It is based on Deep Gaussian Processes as\nsurrogate models instead of classic Gaussian Processes. This modeling technique\nincreases the power of representation to capture the non-stationarity by simply\nconsidering a functional composition of stationary Gaussian Processes,\nproviding a multiple layer structure. This paper proposes a new algorithm for\nGlobal Optimization by coupling Deep Gaussian Processes and Bayesian\nOptimization. The specificities of this optimization method are discussed and\nhighlighted with academic test cases.

The contribution of this work\nis to propose a modeling framework, in which, human pilot reactions are modeled\nusing reinforcement learning and a game theoretical concept called level-k\nreasoning to fill this gap. The level-k reasoning concept is based on the\nassumption that humans have various levels of decision making. Reinforcement\nlearning is a mathematical learning method that is rooted in human learning. In\nthis work, a classical and an approximate reinforcement learning (Neural Fitted\nQ Iteration) methods are used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with\n2D and 3D maneuvers.

In contrast to visible light cameras, thermal cameras offer\nvisibility in the infrared spectrum and can be used in a complementary manner\nwith visible spectrum cameras for robot localization and navigation tasks,\nwithout paying the significant weight and power penalty typically associated\nwith carrying other sensors. Exploiting this fact, in this work we present a\nmulti-sensor fusion algorithm for reliable odometry estimation in GPS-denied\nand degraded visual environments. The proposed method utilizes information from\nboth the visible and thermal spectra for landmark selection and prioritizes\nfeature extraction from informative image regions based on a metric over\nspatial entropy. Furthermore, inertial sensing cues are integrated to improve\nthe robustness of the odometry estimation process. To verify our solution, a\nset of challenging experiments were conducted inside a) an obscurant filed\nmachine shop-like industrial environment, as well as b) a dark subterranean\nmine in the presence of heavy airborne dust.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this paper, considering an interference limited inband downlink cellular\nnetwork, we study the effects of scheduling criteria, mobility constraints,\npath loss models, backhaul constraints, and 3D antenna radiation pattern on\ntrajectory optimization problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In\nparticular, we consider a UAV that is tasked to travel between two locations\nwithin a given amount of time (e.g., for delivery or surveillance purposes),\nand we consider that such a UAV can be used to improve cellular connectivity of\nmobile users by serving as a relay for the terrestrial network. As the\noptimization problem is hard to solve numerically, we explore the dynamic\nprogramming (DP) technique for finding the optimum UAV trajectory. We utilize\ncapacity and coverage performance of the terrestrial network while studying all\nthe effects of different techniques and phenomenon. Extensive simulations show\nthat the maximum sum-rate trajectory provides the best per user capacity\nwhereas, the optimal proportional fair (PF) rate trajectory provides higher\ncoverage probability than the other two. Since, the generated trajectories are\ninfeasible for the UAV to follow exactly as it can not take sharp turns due to\nkinematic constraints, we generate smooth trajectory using Bezier curves. Our\nresults show that the cellular capacity using the Bezier curves is close to the\ncapacity observed when using the optimal trajectories.",
