A 2-dimensional empirical expression for the contrast of photospheric\nfeatures as a function of both the position on the disk and the averaged\nmagnetic field strength was determined, showing its validity through the\nstudied time period. A study of the relationship between magnetogram signal and\nthe peak contrasts shows that the intrinsic contrast (maximum contrast per unit\nof magnetic flux) of network flux tubes is higher than that of active region\nfaculae during the solar cycle.",

It is proposed that Titan\ninitially condensed as a secondary embryo in the same proto-solar gas ring from\nwhich the central solid core and gaseous envelope of Saturn were acquired. At\nthe orbit of Saturn, the bulk chemical constituents of the condensate are rock\n(mass fraction 0.494), water ice (0.474), and graphite (0.032). The mean\ndensity is 1523 kg/m^3. Structural models for a frozen Titan yield a mean\ndensity of 2095 kg/m^3 (chemically homogeneous case) and 1904 kg/m^3 (fully\ndifferentiated 2-zone case). The agreement to one percent of the latter value\nwith the observed mean density suggests that Titan is indeed a fully\ndifferentiated satellite. The value of C/MR^2 for this model is 0.316. It is\npredicted that Titan has no internal ocean or induced magnetic field but it may\npossess a small native dipole field of magnitude 2 x 10^11 Tesla m^3 due to\nthermoremanent magnetization fed by the ancient magnetic field of Saturn.\nCapture of Titan was achieved by gas drag at the edge of the proto-Saturnian\nenvelope at a time when that cloud had a radius close to the present orbital\nsize of Titan. Collisional drag was also probably an important agent in\nsecuring the capture of Titan. Perhaps Hyperion is the shattered remnant of a\npre-existing native moon of Saturn that was destroyed on the arrival of Titan.\nTitan should thus have much the same appearance as Triton, being nearly smooth,\ncrater-free and streaked with elemental carbon (Prentice 2004a).",

The optical fluxes declined by ~2 magnitudes during the\nfirst 16 days and then commenced quasi-periodic secondary outbursts, with\ntime-scales of several days, similar to those seen in 2000 and 2002. The\nbroadband spectra derived from these measurements were generally consistent\nwith emission from an X-ray heated accretion disc. During the first 16 days\ndecline in intensity the spectrum became redder. We suggest that the primary\noutburst was initiated by a viscosity change driven instability in the inner\ndisc and note the contrast with another accreting millisecond pulsar, XTE\nJ0929--314, for which the spectrum becomes bluer during the decline. On the\nnight of 2005 June 5 (HJD 2453527) the I band flux was ~0.45 magnitudes\nbrighter than on the preceding or following nights whereas the BVR bands showed\nno obvious enhancement. A Type I X-ray burst was detected by the RXTE\nspacecraft during this I band integration. It seems unlikely that reprocessed\nradiation from the burst was sufficient to explain the observed increase. We\nsuggest that a major part of the I band excess was due to synchrotron emission\ntriggered by the X-ray burst. Several other significant short duration changes\nin V-I were detected. One occurred at about HJD 2453546 in the early phase of\nthe first secondary outburst and may be due to a mass transfer instability or\nto another synchrotron emission event.",

We have modelled the arrival of these relativistic\nprotons at Earth using a technique which deduces the spectrum, arrival\ndirection and anisotropy of the high-energy protons that produce increased\nresponses in neutron monitors. To investigate the acceleration processes\ninvolved we have employed theoretical shock and stochastic acceleration\nspectral forms in our fits to spacecraft and neutron monitor data. During the\nrising phase of the event (10:45 UT and 10:50 UT) we find that the spectrum\nbetween 140 MeV and 4 GeV is best fitted by a shock acceleration spectrum. In\ncontrast, the spectrum at the peak (10:55 UT and 11:00 UT) and in the declining\nphase (11:40 UT) is best fitted with a stochastic acceleration spectrum. We\npropose that at least two acceleration processes were responsible for the\nproduction of relativistic protons during the Bastille Day solar event: (1)\nprotons were accelerated to relativistic energies by a shock, presumably a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME). (2) protons were also accelerated to relativistic\nenergies by stochastic processes initiated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence.",

As an analog to \"Kepler-like\" photometric transit observations, we\nobtained (spatially unresolved) radiometric observations with the ACRIM 3\ninstrument on ACRIMSAT to follow the effect of the ToV on the total solar\nirradiance (TSI). Contemporaneous high-resolution broadband imagery with NASA's\nTRACE spacecraft provided, directly, measures of the stellar (solar)\nastrophysical noise that can intrinsically limit such transit observations.\nDuring the ~ 5.5 h transit, the planet's angular diameter was approximately\n1/32 the solar diameter, thus covering ~ 0.1 of the stellar surface. With our\nACRIM 3 data, we measure temporal changes in TSI with a 1 sigma per sample\n(unbinned) uncertainty of approximately 100 mW m^-2 (0.007%). A diminution in\nTSI of ~ 1.4 W m^-2 (~ 0.1%, closely corresponding to the geometrically\nocculted area of the photosphere) was measured at mid-transit compared with a\nmean pre/post transit TSI of ~ 1365.9 W m^-2.

Numerical and structural models for Rhea\nare constructed on the basis of a computed bulk chemical mix of hydrated rock\n(mass fraction 0.385), H2O ice (0.395), and NH3 ice (0.220). The large\nproportion of NH3 in the ice mass inhibits the formation of the dense\ncrystalline phase II of H2O ice at the satellite's centre.

The satellite is nearly\nisodense and the predicted value of the axial moment-of-inertia factor is\nC/MR^2 = 0.399 +/- 0.004. NH3 is unstable at Saturn's distance from the Sun,\nexcept near the polar regions of the satellite. Perhaps the Cassini Orbiter\nwill discover indirect evidence for NH3 through the sublimative escape of this\nice from the outer layers, especially near the equatorial zones.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In determining Mercury's core structure from its rotational properties, the\nvalue of the normalized moment of inertia, $C/MR^2$, from the location of\nCassini 1 is crucial. If Mercury's spin axis occupies Cassini state 1, its\nposition defines the location of the state. The spin might be displaced from\nthe Cassini state if the spin is unable to follow the changes in the state\nposition induced by the variations in the orbital parameters and the geometry\nof the solar system. The spin axis is expected to follow the Cassini state for\norbit variations with time scales long compared to the 1000 year precession\nperiod of the spin about the Cassini state because the solid angle swept out by\nthe spin axis as it precesses is an adiabatic invariant. Short period\nvariations in the orbital elements of small amplitude should cause\ndisplacements that are commensurate with the amplitudes of the short period\nterms. By following simultaneously the spin position and the Cassini state\nposition during long time scale orbital variations over past 3 million years\n(Quinn {\\it et al.}, 1991) and short time scale variations from JPL Ephemeris\nDE 408 (Standish, 2005) we show that the spin axis will remain within one\narcsec of the Cassini state after it is brought there by dissipative torques.\nWe thus expect Mercury's spin to occupy Cassini state 1 well within the\nuncertainties for both radar and spacecraft measurements, with correspondingly\ntight constraints on $C/MR^2$.",

The relative frequency shift (proportional to the light\ntravel time) for the LISA arm length is estimated to 10E-16, which is much\nbigger than the expected amplitude of gravitational waves. The anomalous\nblueshift enters the LISA signal in two ways, as a small term folded with the\ngravitational wave signal, and as larger term at low frequencies.

It has, however, also been claimed that GRB031203 was\nintrinsically sub-energetic, representative of a class of spectrally hard,\nlow-energy bursts quite different from other GRBs. Reanalysis of the available\ndata confirms our original finding that GRB031203 had a very large soft X-ray\ncomponent, the time of which can be constrained to within a few minutes after\nthe burst, implying that while GRB031203 did indeed have a very low apparent\nluminosity, it was also very soft. Notions propagated in the literature\nregarding the uncertainties in the determination of the soft X-ray fluence from\nthe halo data and on the available constraints from the hard X-ray data are\naddressed: the properties of the scattering dust along the line of sight (grain\nsizes, precise location and the geometry) are determined directly from the high\nquality X-ray data so that there is little uncertainty about the scatterer;\nconstraints on the X-ray lightcurve from the Integral spacecraft at the time of\nthe soft X-ray blast are not complete because of a slew in the spacecraft\npointing shortly after the burst. Claims that GRB031203 was intrinsically\nunder-energetic and that it represents a deviation from the luminosity-peak\nenergy relation do not appear to be substantiated by the data, regardless of\nwhether the soft X-ray component is declared part of the prompt emission or the\nafterglow.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present observations of GRB 050318 by the Ultra-Violet and Optical\nTelescope (UVOT) on-board the Swift observatory. The data are the first\ndetections of a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow decay by the UVOT instrument,\nlaunched specifically to open a new window on these transient sources. We\nshowcase UVOTs ability to provide multi-color photometry and the advantages of\ncombining UVOT data with simultaneous and contemporaneous observations from the\nhigh-energy detectors on the Swift spacecraft. Multiple filters covering\n1,800-6,000 Angstroms reveal a red source with spectral slope steeper than the\nsimultaneous X-ray continuum. Spectral fits indicate that the UVOT colors are\nconsistent with dust extinction by systems at z = 1.2037 and z = 1.4436,\nredshifts where absorption systems have been pre-identified. However, the data\ncan be most-easily reproduced with models containing a foreground system of\nneutral gas redshifted by z = 2.8 +/- 0.3. For both of the above scenarios,\nspectral and decay slopes are, for the most part, consistent with fireball\nexpansion into a uniform medium, provided a cooling break occurs between the\nenergy ranges of the UVOT and Swifts X-ray instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The understanding of the universe is confused by the unknown nature of about\n95% of its matter, required to confine the motions of space objects in cosmic\nstructures. The idea of this paper is that the self-similar transformations of\none postulated basic matter create the fundamental dynamic fractal elements of\nthe universe. The elements are described with equation of unifying interaction\ndrawn into their fundamental framework. The equation transforms into the\ninverse square laws, the principle of uncertainty, Maxwell equations of\nelectromagnetic field and into MOND like expression after modification of its\nparameters at the scales where these laws and principle are found to hold. The\nintroduced equation is also confirmed with calculations based on the orbital\ndata for bodies that move around the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, the\ncenters of the Earth and the Sun and orbit the huge 87 Sylvia asteroid. The\npuzzling constant sunward force that acts on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft,\nthe flat rotational curves of stars far from the galactic nuclei, the nature of\ndark matter and the enigmatic cosmic repulsion are explained in terms of\ncontracting and expanding 3D-spirally-faster-inward-oscillating vortexes of\nbasic matter, called dynamic fractals. The latter create new fundamental\nframework, which allows qualitative and quantitative modeling by fitting of the\nparameters of the equation of unifying interaction to experimental data. The\ncalculations based on the proposed dynamic fractal framework are in agreement\nwith the considered orbital data. Many testable predictions are made and\nnatural hazard precursors are suggested.",

Relying on two spacecrafts in a formation flying\nconfiguration, SIMBOL-X uses for the first time a ~ 30 m focal length X-ray\nmirror to focus X-rays with energy above 10 keV, resulting in a two orders of\nmagnitude improvement in angular resolution and sensitivity in the hard X-ray\nrange with respect to non focusing techniques. The SIMBOL-X revolutionary\ninstrumental capabilities will allow to elucidate outstanding questions in high\nenergy astrophysics, related in particular to the physics of accretion onto\ncompact objects, to the acceleration of particles to the highest energies, and\nto the nature of the Cosmic X-Ray background. The mission, which has gone\nthrough a thorough assessment study performed by CNES, is expected to start a\ncompetitive phase A in autumn 2005, leading to a flight decision at the end of\n2006, for a launch in 2012.

The light curve of 4U 0114+65 shows a large flare at the beginning\nof the BeppoSAX pointing and no significant hardness evolution either during\nthe flare or in the low state occurring after the flare itself. The modulation\nat about 2.7 hours, attributed to the accreting neutron star (NS) spin\nperiodicity, is not significantly detected in our data, although fluctuations\nwith timescales of about 3 hours can be seen in the 2-10 keV light curve.\nShorter modulations down to timescales of minutes, are also found and\ninterpreted as due to accretion of matter onto the NS. The flaring and the low\nstate spectra of 4U 0114+65 can be equally well fitted either with a power law\nmodulated by a high-energy exponential cutoff or with a Comptonization model.\nDuring the low state the presence, although tentative, of a thermal component\n(with kT around 0.3 keV) at low energies, possibly produced by an ionized\nplasma cloud around the NS, cannot be excluded. Contrary to previous claims, a\ncyclotron resonant feature in absorption at about 22 keV was not detected in\nthe BeppoSAX spectroscopic data, whereas evidence for a Fe emission line around\n6.4 keV is found only during the low state emission. Using all of the above\ninformation, a scenario for the system in which the NS is embedded in, and\naccreting from, a low angular momentum gas cloud is envisaged.",

Using 1024x1024 HgCdTe and Si:As\narrays at 3.3, 4.7, 12 and 23 microns, WISE will find the most luminous\ngalaxies in the universe, the closest stars to the Sun, and it will detect most\nof the main belt asteroids larger than 3 km. The single WISE instrument\nconsists of a 40 cm diamond-turned aluminum afocal telescope, a two-stage solid\nhydrogen cryostat, a scan mirror mechanism, and reimaging optics giving 5\"\nresolution (full-width-half-maximum). The use of dichroics and beamsplitters\nallows four color images of a 47'x47' field of view to be taken every 8.8\nseconds, synchronized with the orbital motion to provide total sky coverage\nwith overlap between revolutions. WISE will be placed into a Sun-synchronous\npolar orbit on a Delta 7320-10 launch vehicle. The WISE survey approach is\nsimple and efficient. The three-axis-stabilized spacecraft rotates at a\nconstant rate while the scan mirror freezes the telescope line of sight during\neach exposure. WISE is currently in its Preliminary Design Phase, with the\nmission Preliminary Design Review scheduled for July, 2005. WISE is scheduled\nto launch in mid 2009; the project web site can be found at\nthis http URL.",

At the time of writing (May 2005), it has one of the faintest GRB\nafterglows ever observed. The spacecraft could not slew immediately to the\nburst, so the first X-ray and optical observations occurred approximately 45\nminutes after the trigger. Although no optical emission was found by any\ninstrument, both Swift and XMM-Newton detected the fading X-ray afterglow.\nCombined data from both of these observatories show the afterglow to be fading\nmonotonically as 0.99 +0.15/-0.12 over a time frame between 45 minutes to 27\nhours post-burst. Spectral analysis, allowed largely by the higher through-put\nof XMM-Newton, implies a power-law with a slope of Gamma=1.75 +0.19/-0.18 and\nshows no evidence for absorption above the Galactic column of 7 x 10^20 cm^-2.\nFrom the X-ray decay and spectral slopes, a low electron power-law index of p\n= 1.3-1.9 is derived; the slopes also imply that a jet-break has not occured up\nto 27 hours after the burst. The faintness of GRB050223 may be due to a large\njet opening or viewing angle or a high redshift.",

All three spacecraft are on heliocentric and\nweakly eccentric orbits forming a stable triangle. It has been shown that for\ncertain spacecraft orbits, the arms keep constant distances to the first order\nin the eccentricities. However, exact orbitography shows the so-called\n`breathing modes' of the arms where the arms slowly change their lengths over\nthe time-scale of a year. In this paper we analyse the breathing modes (the\nflexing of the arms) with the help of the geodesic deviation equations to\noctupole order which are shown to be equivalent to higher order\nClohessy-Wiltshire equations. We show that the flexing of the arms of LISA as\ngiven by the `exact' solution of Keplerian orbits, which gives constant\narmlengths to the first order in eccentricity and whose maximum flexing\namplitude is $\\sim 115,000$ km, can be improved, by tilting the plane of the\nLISA triangle slightly from the proposed orientation of $60^\\circ$ with the\necliptic to obtain a maximum flexing amplitude of $\\sim 48,000$ km, reducing it\nby a factor of $\\sim 2.4$. The reduction factor is even larger if we consider\nthe corresponding Doppler shifts, for which the reduction factor reaches almost\na factor of 6. We solve the second order equations and obtain the general\nsolution. We then use the general solution to establish the optimality of the\nsolutions that we have found.",

The core-mantle coupling dominates the\ndamping over the tides by one to two orders of magnitude for the plausible\nparameters chosen. The short damping times compared with the age of the solar\nsystem means we must find recent or on-going excitation mechanisms if such free\nmotions are found by the current radar experiments or the future measurement by\nthe MESSENGER and BepiColombo spacecraft that will orbit Mercury. We also show\nthat the average precession rate is increased by about 30% over that obtained\nfrom the traditional precession constant because of a spin-orbit resonance\ninduced contribution by the C_{22} term in the expansion of the gravitational\nfield. The C_{22} contribution also causes the path of the spin during the\nprecession to be slightly elliptical with a variation in the precession rate\nthat is a maximum when the obliquity is a minimum. An observable free\nprecession will compromise the determination of obliquity of the Cassini state\nand hence of C/MR^2 for Mercury, but a detected free libration will not\ncompromise the determination of the forced libration amplitude and thus the\nverification of a liquid core",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft yielded the most precise navigation in deep\nspace to date. These spacecraft had exceptional acceleration sensitivity.\nHowever, analysis of their radio-metric tracking data has consistently\nindicated that at heliocentric distances of $\\sim 20-70$ astronomical units,\nthe orbit determinations indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, Doppler\nfrequency drift. The drift is a blue-shift, uniformly changing with a rate of\n$\\sim(5.99 \\pm 0.01)\\times 10^{-9}$ Hz/s, which can be interpreted as a\nconstant sunward acceleration of each particular spacecraft of $a_P = (8.74 \\pm\n1.33)\\times 10^{-10} {\\rm m/s^2}$. This signal has become known as the Pioneer\nanomaly. The inability to explain the anomalous behavior of the Pioneers with\nconventional physics has contributed to growing discussion about its origin.\nThere is now an increasing number of proposals that attempt to explain the\nanomaly outside conventional physics. This progress emphasizes the need for a\nnew experiment to explore the detected signal. Furthermore, the recent\nextensive efforts led to the conclusion that only a dedicated experiment could\nultimately determine the nature of the found signal. We discuss the Pioneer\nanomaly and present the next steps towards an understanding of its origin. We\nspecifically focus on the development of a mission to explore the Pioneer\nAnomaly in a dedicated experiment conducted in deep space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Using the cometary nucleus model developed by Espinasse et al. (1991), we\ncalculate the thermodynamical evolution of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 over a period of\n360 years. Starting from an initially amorphous cometary nucleus which\nincorporates an icy mixture of H2O and CO, we show that, at the time of Deep\nImpact collision, the crater is expected to form at depths where ice is in its\ncrystalline form. Hence, the subsurface exposed to space should not be\nprimordial. We also attempt an order-of-magnitude estimate of the heating and\nmaterial ablation effects on the crater activity caused by the 370 Kg\nprojectile released by the DI spacecraft. We thus show that heating effects\nplay no role in the evolution of crater activity. We calculate that the CO\nproduction rate from the impacted region should be about 300-400 times higher\nfrom the crater resulting from the impact with a 35 m ablation than over the\nunperturbed nucleus in the immediate post-impact period. We also show that the\nH2O production rate is decreased by several orders of magnitude at the crater\nbase just after ablation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We report several results related to the dynamical evolution of dust produced\nin the Kuiper Belt (KB). We show that its particle size frequency distribution\nin space is greatly changed from the distribution at production, as a results\nof the combined effects of radiation forces and the perturbations of the\nplanets. We estimate the contribution of KB dust to the zodiacal cloud by\ncalculating the radial profile of its number density near the ecliptic. We also\nstudy the contribution of KB dust to the population of interplanetary dust\nparticles (IDPs) collected at Earth, by calculating geocentric encounter\nvelocities and capture rates. Our models show, in contrast with previous\nstudies, that KB dust grains on Earth-crossing orbits have high eccentricities\nand inclinations and, therefore, their encounter velocities are similar to\nthose of cometary grains and not to asteroidal grains. We estimate that at most\n25% in number of captured IDPs have cometary or KB origin; the KB contribution\nmay be as low as 1%-2%. We present the velocity field of KB dust throughout the\nsolar system; this, together with the number density radial profile, is\npotentially useful for planning spacecraft missions to the outer solar system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first probes sent to study the outer planets of\nthe Solar System and Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to leave the Solar\nSystem. Besides their already epic journeys, Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were\nsubjected to an unaccounted effect interpreted as a constant acceleration\ntoward the Sun, the so-called Pioneer anomaly. One of the possibilities put\nforward for explaining the Pioneer anomaly is the gravitational acceleration of\nthe Kuiper Belt. In this work we examine this hypothesis for various models for\nthe Kuiper Belt mass distribution. We find that the gravitational effect due to\nthe Kuiper Belt cannot account for the Pioneer anomaly. Furthermore, we have\nalso studied the hypothesis that drag forces can explain the the Pioneer\nanomaly; however we conclude that the density required for producing the\nPioneer anomaly is many orders of magnitude greater than those of\ninterplanetary and interstellar dust. Our conclusions suggest that only through\na mission, the Pioneer anomaly can be confirmed and further investigated. If a\nmission with these aims is ever sent to space, it turns out, on account of our\nresults, that it will be also a quite interesting probe to study the mass\ndistribution of the Kuiper Belt.",
