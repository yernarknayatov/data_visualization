    "abstract": "Abstract:  We review the current understanding of the upper atmospheres of Uranus and\nNeptune, and explore the upcoming opportunities available to study these\nexciting planets. The ice giants are the least understood planets in the solar\nsystem, having been only visited by a single spacecraft, in 1986 and 1989,\nrespectively. The upper atmosphere plays a critical role in connecting the\natmosphere to the forces and processes contained within the magnetic field. For\nexample, auroral current systems can drive charged particles into the\natmosphere, heating it by way of Joule heating. Ground-based observations of\nH$_3^+$ provides a powerful remote diagnostic of the physical properties and\nprocesses that occur within the upper atmosphere, and a rich data set exists\nfor Uranus. These observations span almost three decades and have revealed that\nthe upper atmosphere has continuously cooled between 1992 and 2018 at about 8\nK/year, from $\\sim$750 K to $\\sim$500 K. The reason for this trend remain\nunclear, but could be related to seasonally driven changes in the Joule heating\nrates due to the tilted and offset magnetic field, or could be related to\nchanging vertical distributions of hydrocarbons. H$_3^+$ has not yet been\ndetected at Neptune, but this discovery provides low-hanging fruit for upcoming\nfacilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the next\ngeneration of 30 metre telescopes. Detecting H$_3^+$ at Neptune would enable\nthe characterisation of its upper atmosphere for the first time since 1989. To\nfully understand the ice giants we need dedicated orbital missions, in the same\nway the Cassini spacecraft explored Saturn. Only by combining in-situ\nobservations of the magnetic field with in-orbit remote sensing can we get the\ncomplete picture of how energy moves between the atmosphere and the magnetic\nfield.",

We identified, measured, and mapped\nboulders in LAMO images, which have a scale of 20 m per pixel. We estimate that\nour sample is virtually complete down to a boulder size of 4 pixels (80 m). The\nlargest boulder is a 400 m-sized block on the Marcia crater floor. Relatively\nfew boulders reside in a large area of relatively low albedo, surmised to be\nthe carbon-rich ejecta of the Veneneia basin, either because boulders form less\neasily here or live shorter. By comparing the density of boulders around\ncraters with a known age, we find that the maximum boulder lifetime is about\n300 Ma. The boulder size-frequency distribution (SFD) is generally assumed to\nfollow a power law. We fit power laws to the Vesta SFD by means of the maximum\nlikelihood method, but they do not fit well. Our analysis of power law\nexponents for boulders on other small Solar System bodies suggests that the\nderived exponent is primarily a function of boulder size range. The Weibull\ndistribution mimics this behavior and fits the Vesta boulder SFD well. The\nWeibull distribution is often encountered in rock grinding experiments, and may\nresult from the fractal nature of cracks propagating in the rock interior. We\npropose that, in general, the SFD of particles (including boulders) on the\nsurface of small bodies follows a Weibull distribution rather than a power law.",

In this paper, we\ndescribe the science objectives of the mission, and how these will be addressed\nby the joint observations of the instruments onboard. The paper first\nsummarises the mission-level science objectives, followed by an overview of the\nspacecraft and payload.

The paper concludes with a more\ndetailed description of the science objectives.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The proper classification of plasma regions in near-Earth space is crucial to\nperform unambiguous statistical studies of fundamental plasma processes such as\nshocks, magnetic reconnection, waves and turbulence, jets and their\ncombinations. The majority of available studies have been performed by using\nhuman-driven methods, such as visual data selection or the application of\npredefined thresholds to different observable plasma quantities. While\nhuman-driven methods have allowed performing many statistical studies, these\nmethods are often time-consuming and can introduce important biases. On the\nother hand, the recent availability of large, high-quality spacecraft\ndatabases, together with major advances in machine-learning algorithms, can now\nallow meaningful applications of machine learning to in-situ plasma data. In\nthis study, we apply the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) deep\nmachine-leaning algorithm to the recent Magnetospheric Multi Scale (MMS)\nmission data in order to classify ten key plasma regions in near-Earth space\nfor the period 2016-2019. For this purpose, we use available intervals of time\nseries for each such plasma region, which were labeled by using human-driven\nselective downlink applied to MMS burst data. We discuss several quantitative\nparameters to assess the accuracy of both methods. Our results indicate that\nthe FCN method is reliable to accurately classify labeled time series data\nsince it takes into account the dynamical features of the plasma data in each\nregion. We also present good accuracy of the FCN method when applied to\nunlabeled MMS data. Finally, we show how this method used on MMS data can be\nextended to data from the Cluster mission, indicating that such method can be\nsuccessfully applied to any in situ spacecraft plasma database.",

The model assumes an empirically\nmotivated torus-like flux rope structure that expands self-similarly within the\nheliosphere, is influenced by a simplified interaction with the solar wind\nenvironment, and carries along an embedded analytical magnetic field. The\nimproved 3DCORE implementation allows us to generate extremely large ensemble\nsimulations which we then use to find global best-fit model parameters using an\nABC sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm. The usage of this algorithm, under\nsome basic assumptions on the uncertainty of the magnetic field measurements,\nallows us to furthermore generate estimates on the uncertainty of model\nparameters using only a single in situ observation. We apply our model to\nsynthetically generated measurements to prove the validity of our\nimplementation for the fitting procedure. We also present a brief analysis,\nwithin the scope of our model, of an event captured by Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nshortly after its first fly-by of the Sun on 2018 November 12 at 0.25 AU. The\npresented toolset is also easily extendable to the analysis of events captured\nby multiple spacecraft and will therefore facilitate future multi-point\nstudies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Among the current challenges in Space Weather, one of the main ones is to\nforecast the internal magnetic configuration within Interplanetary Coronal Mass\nEjections (ICMEs). Currently, a monotonic and coherent magnetic configuration\nobserved is associated with the result of a spacecraft crossing a large flux\nrope with helical magnetic field lines topology. The classification of such an\narrangement is essential to predict geomagnetic disturbance. Thus, the\nclassification relies on the assumption that the ICME's internal structure is a\nwell organized magnetic flux rope. This paper applies machine learning and a\ncurrent physical flux rope analytical model to identify and further understand\nthe internal structures of ICMEs. We trained an image recognition artificial\nneural network with analytical flux rope data, generated from the range of many\npossible trajectories within a cylindrical (circular and elliptical\ncross-section) model. The trained network was then evaluated against the\nobserved ICMEs from WIND during 1995-2015.\nThe methodology developed in this paper can classify 84% of simple real cases\ncorrectly and has a 76% success rate when extended to a broader set with 5%\nnoise applied, although it does exhibit a bias in favor of positive flux rope\nclassification. As a first step towards a generalizable classification and\nparameterization tool, these results show promise. With further tuning and\nrefinement, our model presents a strong potential to evolve into a robust tool\nfor identifying flux rope configurations from in situ data.",

In particular we focus on the properties of the\nmagnetic field and its component anisotropy in Cluster measurements and hybrid\n2D simulations. First, we address the angular distribution of wave-vectors in\nthe kinetic range between ion and electron scales by studying the variance\nanisotropy of the magnetic field components. When taking into account the\nsingle-direction sampling performed by spacecraft in the solar wind, the main\nproperties of the fluctuations observed in situ are also recovered in our\nnumerical description. This result confirms that solar wind turbulence in the\nsub-ion range is characterized by a quasi-2D gyrotropic distribution of\nk-vectors around the mean field. We then consider the magnetic compressibility\nassociated with the turbulent cascade and its evolution from large-MHD to\nsub-ion scales. The ratio of field-aligned to perpendicular fluctuations,\ntypically low in the MHD inertial range, increases significantly when crossing\nion scales and its value in the sub-ion range is a function of the total plasma\nbeta only, as expected from theoretical predictions, with higher magnetic\ncompressibility for higher beta. Moreover, we observe that this increase has a\ngradual trend from low to high beta values in the in situ data; this behaviour\nis well captured by the numerical simulations. The level of magnetic field\ncompressibility that is observed in situ and in the simulations is in fairly\ngood agreement with theoretical predictions, especially at high beta,\nsuggesting that in the kinetic range explored the turbulence is supported by\nlow-frequency and highly-oblique fluctuations in pressure balance, like kinetic\nAlfv\u00e9n waves or other slowly evolving coherent structures.",

For the A-\nand B-type stars observed by BRITE, one star (HR 7403) shows low amplitude low\nfrequency modes that likely are associated with its B(emission) star\nproperties; one star (HR 7179) shows SPB variability that is also found in\nprior Kepler data, and two stars (HR 7284 and HR 7591) show no variability in\nBRITE data, although very low amplitude variability was found in TESS or Kepler\ndata. For the TESS and BRITE targets discussed here, follow-up ground- and\nspace-based photometric and spectroscopic observations combined with stellar\nmodeling will be needed to constrain stellar parameters and to understand the\nnature of the variability.",

ENA times of flight from the\nproduction regions in the heliosheath are relatively easy to estimate because\nthese atoms follow almost constant speed, force-free trajectories. For the ISN\npopulations, dynamical and ballistic selection effects are important, and times\nof flight are much longer. We estimate these times for ISN He and H atoms\nobserved by IBEX and in the future by IMAP using the WTPM model with synthesis\nmethod. We show that for the primary population atoms, the times of flight are\non the order of three solar cycle periods, with a spread equivalent to one\nsolar cycle. For the secondary populations, the times of flight are on the\norder of ten solar cycle periods, and during the past ten years of\nobservations, IBEX has been collecting secondary He atoms produced in the OHS\nduring almost entire 19th century. ISN atoms penetrating the heliopause at the\ntime of Voyager crossing will become gradually visible about 2027, during the\nplanned IMAP observations. Hypothetical variations in the ISN flow in the Local\nInterstellar Medium are currently not detectable. Nevertheless, we expect\nsteady-state heliosphere models used with appropriately averaged solar wind\nparameters to be suitable for understanding the ISN observations.",

Hence, the events are divided\ninto three subsamples: active region (AR) CMEs, disappearing filament (DSF)\nCMEs, and stealthy CMEs.

In the next\nstep, MO-events were analysed in more detail, considering the magnetic field\nstrengths and the plasma characteristics in three different segments of the\nICMEs, defined as the turbulent sheath (TS), the frontal region (FR), and the\nMO itself.

Results.\nWe identified three moving radio bursts at unusually high altitudes in the\ncorona that are located at the northern CME flank and move outwards\nsynchronously with the CME. The radio bursts correspond to fine-structured\nemission in dynamic spectra with durations of ~1 s, and they may show forward\nor reverse frequency drifts.

We applied full mission comparative statistics of VS,\nelectron temperature, and electron density to establish VS dependence on cold\nand warm plasma density and electron temperature. We also used\nSpacecraft-Plasma Interaction System (SPIS) simulations and an analytical\nvacuum model to investigate if positively biased elements covering a fraction\nof the solar array surface can explain the observed correlations.

Conclusions. Rosetta is negatively driven mainly by\npositively biased elements on the borders of the front side of the solar panels\nas these can efficiently collect cold plasma electrons. Biased elements\ndistributed elsewhere on the front side of the panels are less efficient at\ncollecting electrons apart from locally produced electrons (photoelectrons).

The kinematic parameters are derived with a new technique\nbased on the Elliptical Conversion (ElCon) method, which uses simultaneous\nobservations from the two viewpoints from STEREO. Outside the field of view of\nthe instruments, we assume that the dynamics of the CME evolution is controlled\nby aerodynamic drag, i.e., a force resulting from the interaction with\nparticles from the background solar wind. To model the drag force we use a\nphysical model that allows us to derive its parameters without the need to rely\non drag coefficients derived empirically. We found a CME ToA mean error of\n$1.6\\pm8.0$ hours ToA and a mean absolute error of $6.9\\pm3.9$ hours for a set\nof 14 events.

Ejecta is produced for impact speeds higher\nthan about 12 cm/s, and ejecta speeds scale with the projectile to target the\ngrain size ratio and the impact speed. Ejected mass estimations indicate that\nejecta is increasingly difficult to produce for increasing grain sizes.\nCoefficients of restitution of rebounding projectiles do not display a\ndependency on the target grain size, unlike their maximum penetration depth,\nwhich can be scaled with the projectile to target grain size ratio.

The satellite task planning\nproblem entails selecting actions that best satisfy mission objectives for\nautonomous execution. Task scheduling is often performed by human operators\nassisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not\nefficiently scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly\ncoordinate actions of multiple vehicles over long horizons. Additionally, the\nproblem becomes more difficult to solve for large constellations as the\ncomplexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested\nobservations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new\ncommercial optical and radar imaging constellations will require automated\nplanning methods to meet stated responsiveness and throughput objectives. This\npaper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite scheduling problem by\ngenerating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and\nfinding a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is\ntested on a scenarios of up to 10,000 requested imaging locations for the\nSkysat constellation of optical satellites as well as simulated constellations\nof up to 24 satellites. Performance is compared with contemporary\ngraph-traversal and mixed-integer linear programming approaches. Empirical\nresults demonstrate improvements in both the solution time along with the\nnumber of scheduled collections beyond baseline methods. For large problems,\nthe maximum independent set approach is able find a feasible schedule with 8%\nmore collections in 75% less time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Rosetta spacecraft escorted Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for 2 years\nalong its journey through the Solar System between 3.8 and 1.24~au. Thanks to\nthe high resolution mass spectrometer on board Rosetta, the detailed ion\ncomposition within a coma has been accurately assessed in situ for the very\nfirst time. Previous cometary missions, such as $\\text{Giotto}$, did not have\nthe instrumental capabilities to identify the exact nature of the plasma in a\ncoma because the mass resolution of the spectrometers onboard was too low to\nseparate ion species with similar masses. In contrast, the Double Focusing Mass\nSpectrometer (DFMS), part of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and\nNeutral Analysis on board Rosetta (ROSINA), with its high mass resolution mode,\noutperformed all of them, revealing the diversity of cometary ions. We\ncalibrated and analysed the set of spectra acquired by DFMS in ion mode from\nOctober 2014 to April 2016. In particular, we focused on the range from 13-39\nu$\\cdot$q$^{-1}$. The high mass resolution of DFMS allows for accurate\nidentifications of ions with quasi-similar masses, separating $^{13}$C$^+$ from\nCH$^+$, for instance. We confirm the presence in situ of predicted cations at\ncomets, such as CH$_m^+$ ($m=1-4$), H$_n$O$^+$ ($n=1-3$), O$^+$, Na$^+$, and\nseveral ionised and protonated molecules. Prior to Rosetta, only a fraction of\nthem had been confirmed from Earth-based observations. In addition, we report\nfor the first time the unambiguous presence of a molecular dication in the gas\nenvelope of a Solar System body, namely CO$_2^{++}$.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Planetary spatial data returned by spacecraft, including images and\nhigher-order products such as mosaics, controlled basemaps, and digital\nelevation models (DEMs), are of critical importance to NASA, its commercial\npartners and other space agencies. Planetary spatial data are an essential\ncomponent of basic scientific research and sustained planetary exploration and\noperations. The Planetary Data System (PDS) is performing the essential job of\narchiving and serving these data, mostly in raw or calibrated form, with less\nsupport for higher-order, more ready-to-use products. However, many planetary\nspatial data remain not readily accessible to and/or usable by the general\nscience user because particular skills and tools are necessary to process and\ninterpret them from the raw initial state. There is a critical need for\nplanetary spatial data to be more accessible and usable to researchers and\nstakeholders. A Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) is a collection of\ndata, tools, standards, policies, and the people that use and engage with them.\nA PSDI comprises an overarching support system for planetary spatial data.\nPSDIs (1) establish effective plans for data acquisition; (2) create and make\navailable higher-order products; and (3) consider long-term planning for\ncorrect data acquisition, processing and serving (including funding). We\nrecommend that Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructures be created for all bodies\nand key regions in the Solar System. NASA, with guidance from the planetary\nscience community, should follow established data format standards to build\nfoundational and framework products and use those to build and apply PDSIs to\nall bodies. Establishment of PSDIs is critical in the coming decade for several\nlocations under active or imminent exploration, and for all others for future\nplanning and current scientific analysis.",

Investigating\nTitan from the unique standpoint of a polar orbit would enable comprehensive\nglobal maps to uncover the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, and the\ntopography and geophysical environment of the surface and subsurface. The\nmission includes two key elements: (1) an orbiter spacecraft, which also acts\nas a data relay, and (2) one or more small probes to directly investigate\nTitan's seas and make the first direct measurements of their liquid composition\nand physical environment. The orbiter would carry a sophisticated remote\nsensing payload, including a novel topographic lidar, a long-wavelength\nsurface-penetrating radar, a sub-millimeter sounder for winds and for\nmesospheric/thermospheric composition, and a camera and near-infrared\nspectrometer. An instrument suite to analyze particles and fields would include\na mass spectrometer to focus on the interactions between Titan's escaping upper\natmosphere and the solar wind and Saturnian magnetosphere. The orbiter would\nenter a stable polar orbit around 1500 to 1800 km, from which vantage point it\nwould make global maps of the atmosphere and surface. One or more probes,\nreleased from the orbiter, would investigate Titan's seas in situ, including\npossible differences in composition between higher and lower latitude seas, as\nwell as the atmosphere during the parachute descent. The number of probes, as\nwell as the instrument complement on the orbiter and probe, remain to be\nfinalized during a mission study that we recommend to NASA as part of the NRC\nDecadal Survey for Planetary Science now underway, with the goal of an overall\nmission cost in the \"small flagship\" category of ~$2 bn. International\npartnerships, similar to Cassini-Huygens, may also be included for\nconsideration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The first definite interstellar object observed in our solar system was\ndiscovered in October of 2017 and was subsequently designated 1I/'Oumuamua. In\naddition to its extrasolar origin, observations and analysis of this object\nindicate some unusual features which can only be explained by in-situ\nexploration. For this purpose, various spacecraft intercept missions have been\nproposed. Their propulsion schemes have been chemical, exploiting a Jupiter and\nSolar Oberth Maneuver (mission duration of 22 years) and also using Earth-based\nlasers to propel laser sails (1-2 years), both with launch dates in 2030. For\nthe former, mission durations are quite prolonged and for the latter, the\nnecessary laser infrastructure may not be in place by 2030. In this study\nNuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) is examined which has yet to materialise as\nfar as real missions are concerned, but due to its research and development in\nthe NASA Rover/NERVA programs, actually has a higher TRL than laser propulsion.\nVarious solid reactor core options are studied, using either engines directly\nderived from the NASA programs, or more advanced options, like a proposed\nparticle bed NTP system. With specific impulses at least twice those of\nchemical rockets, NTP opens the opportunity for much higher {\\Delta}V budgets,\nallowing simpler and more direct, time-saving trajectories to be exploited. For\nexample a spacecraft with an upgraded NERVA/Pewee-class NTP travelling along an\nEarth-Jupiter-1I trajectory, would reach 1I/'Oumuamua within 14 years of a\nlaunch in 2031. The payload mass to 1I/'Oumuamua would be around 2.5metric\ntonnes, but even larger masses and shorter mission durations can be achieved\nwith some of the more advanced NTP options studied. In all 4 different proposed\nNTP systems and 5 different trajectory scenarios are examined.",

The analytical formula\ncaptures the influence of the magnetic field magnitude and tilt, electron\nemission energy, electron reflection on the surface, and electric field\nintensity on the secondary emission process. The last two parameters increase\nthe effective emission while the others act the opposite. The electric field\neffect is equivalent to a reduction of the magnetic field tilt. A very good\nagreement is shown between the analytical and numerical results for a wide\nrange of parameters. The analytical solution is a convenient tool for the\ntheoretical study and design of magnetically assisted applications, providing\nrealistic input for subsequent simulations.",

What, precisely, is the purpose for building such a structure? For\nexample, what if the space elevator could provide propellant-free (free\nrelease) orbital transfer to every planet in the solar system and beyond on a\ndaily basis? In our view, this benefit might outweigh the costs and risks. But\ncan a space elevator provide such a service? In this manuscript, we examine 3\ntiers of space elevator launch system design and provide a detailed\nmathematical analysis of the orbital mechanics of spacecraft utilizing such\ndesigns. We find the limiting factor in all designs is the problem of\ntransition to the ecliptic plane. For Tiers 1 and 2, we find that free release\ntransfers to all the outer planets is possible, achieving velocities far beyond\nthe ability of current Earth-based rocket technology, but with significant gaps\nin coverage due to planetary alignment. For Tier 3 elevators, however, we find\nthat fast free release transfers to all planets in the solar system is possible\non a daily basis. Finally, we show that Tier 2 and 3 space elevators can\npotentially use counterweights to perform staged slingshot maneuvers, providing\na velocity multiplier which could dramatically reduce transit times to outer\nplanets and interstellar destinations.",

POEMMA\nconsists of two spacecraft flying in a loose formation at 525 km altitude,\n28.5$^\\circ$ inclination orbits. Each spacecraft hosts a Schmidt telescope with\na large collecting area and wide Field-of-View (FoV). A novel focal plane is\nemployed that is optimized to observe both the UV fluorescence signal from\nextensive air showers (EASs) and the optical Cherenkov signals from EASs. In\nUHECR stereo fluorescence mode, POEMMA will measure the spectrum, composition,\nand full-sky distribution of the UHECRs above 20 EeV with high statistics along\nwith remarkable sensitivity to UHE neutrinos. The POEMMA spacecraft are\ndesigned to quickly re-orient to a Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) neutrino mode to\nobserve transient astrophysical sources with unique sensitivity. In this mode,\nPOEMMA will be able to detect cosmic tau neutrino events above 20 PeV by\nmeasuring the upward-moving EASs for $\\tau$-lepton decays induced from tau\nneutrino interactions in the Earth. In this paper, POEMMA's science goals and\ninstrument design are summarized with a focus on the SiPM implementation in\nPOEMMA, along with a detailed discussion of the properties of the Cherenkov EAS\nsignal in the context of wide wavelength sensitivity offered by SiPMs. A\ncomparison of the fluorescence response between SiPMs and the MAPMTs currently\nplanned for use in POEMMA will also be discussed, assessing the potential for\nSiPMs to perform EAS fluorescence measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work adds on to the on-going efforts to provide more autonomy to space\nrobots. Here the concept of programming by demonstration or imitation learning\nis used for trajectory planning of manipulators mounted on small spacecraft.\nFor greater autonomy in future space missions and minimal human intervention\nthrough ground control, a robot arm having 7-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) is\nenvisaged for carrying out multiple tasks like debris removal, on-orbit\nservicing and assembly. Since actual hardware implementation of microgravity\nenvironment is extremely expensive, the demonstration data for trajectory\nlearning is generated using a model predictive controller (MPC) in a physics\nbased simulator. The data is then encoded compactly by Probabilistic Movement\nPrimitives (ProMPs). This offline trajectory learning allows faster\nreproductions and also avoids any computationally expensive optimizations after\ndeployment in a space environment. It is shown that the probabilistic\ndistribution can be used to generate trajectories to previously unseen\nsituations by conditioning the distribution. The motion of the robot (or\nmanipulator) arm induces reaction forces on the spacecraft hub and hence its\nattitude changes prompting the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)\nto take large corrective action that drains energy out of the system. By having\na robot arm with redundant DoF helps in finding several possible trajectories\nfrom the same start to the same target. This allows the ProMP trajectory\ngenerator to sample out the trajectory which is obstacle free as well as having\nminimal attitudinal disturbances thereby reducing the load on ADCS.",

Thanks to the\nEuropean Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft, which orbited comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko for two years, we can investigate, for the first\ntime, CN around a comet at high spatial and temporal resolution. On board\nRosetta's orbiter module, the high-resolution double-focusing mass spectrometer\nDFMS, part of the ROSINA instrument suite, analyzed the neutral volatiles\n(including HCN and the CN radical) in the inner coma of the comet throughout\nthat whole two-year phase and at variable cometocentric distances. From a\nthorough analysis of the full-mission data, the abundance of CN radicals in the\ncometary coma has been derived.

We take advantage of multi-viewpoint observations\nover five month-long intervals, corresponding to special orbital configurations\nof the coronagraphs aboard the STEREO and SOHO missions. This allows us to sort\nout CMEs from other outward-propagating features (e.g. waves or outflows), and\nthus to identify the total number of unique CMEs ejected during those periods.\nWe determine the CME visibility functions of the STEREO COR2-A/B and LASCO\nC2/C3 coronagraphs directly as the ratio of observed to unique CMEs. The\nvisibility functions range from 0.71 to 0.92 for a 95% confidence interval. By\ncomparing detections between coronagraphs on the same spacecraft and from\nmultiple spacecraft, we assess the influence of field of view, instrument\nperformance, and projection effects on the CME detection ability without\nresorting to proxies, such as flares or radio bursts. We find that no major\nCMEs are missed by any of the coronagraphs, that a few slow halo-like events\nmay be missed in synoptic cadence movies and, that narrow field of view\ncoronagraphs have difficulties discriminating between CMEs and other ejections\nleading to false detection rates. We conclude that CME detection can only be\nvalidated with multi-viewpoint imaging-- two coronagraphs in quadrature offer\nadequate detection capability. Finally, we apply the visibility functions to\nobserved CME rates resulting in upward corrections of 40%.",

Coronal unipolar\nstreamers (i.e. pseudostreamers) undergo limited field line expansion,\nresulting in $f_s$-dependent relationships to predict fast wind associated with\nthese structures. However, case studies have shown that in situ observed\npseudostreamer solar wind was much slower than that derived with $f_s$. To\ninvestigate this further, we conduct a statistical analysis to determine if\n$f_s$ and $v_{obs}$ are inversely correlated for a large sample of periods when\npseudostreamer wind was observed at multiple 1 AU spacecraft (i.e. ACE,\nSTEREO-A/B). We use the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model driven by Air Force Data\nAssimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) photospheric field maps to\nidentify 38 periods when spacecraft observe pseudostreamer wind. We compare the\nexpansion factor of the last open field lines on either side of a\npseudostreamer cusp with the corresponding in situ measured solar wind speed.\nWe find only slow wind ($v_{obs}$ $<$ 500 km/s) is associated with\npseudostreamers, and that there is not a significant correlation between $f_s$\nand $v_{obs}$ for these field lines. This suggests that field lines near the\nopen-closed boundary of pseudostreamers are not subject to the steady-state\nacceleration along continuously open flux tubes assumed in the $f_s$-$v_{obs}$\nrelationship. In general, dynamics at the boundary between open and closed\nfield lines such as interchange reconnection will invalidate the steady-state\nassumptions of this relationship.",

Although these objects are\nall fluid, hydrogen worlds with stratified atmospheres overlying convective\ninteriors, they exhibit an impressive diversity of atmospheric behavior. Hot\nJupiters are strongly irradiated, and a wealth of observations constrain the\nday-night temperature differences, circulation, and cloudiness. The intense\nstellar irradiation, presumed tidal locking and modest rotation leads to a\nnovel regime of strong day-night radiative forcing. Circulation models predict\nlarge day-night temperature differences, global-scale eddies, patchy clouds,\nand, in most cases, a fast eastward jet at the equator-equatorial\nsuperrotation. The warm Jupiters may exhibit a wide range of rotation rates,\nobliquities, and orbital eccentricities, which, along with the weaker\nirradiation, leads to circulation patterns and observable signatures predicted\nto differ substantially from hot Jupiters. Brown dwarfs are typically isolated,\nrapidly rotating worlds; they radiate enormous energy fluxes into space and\nconvect vigorously in their interiors. Their atmospheres exhibit patchiness in\nclouds and temperature on regional to global scales-the result of modulation by\nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation. Despite the lack of irradiation, such\ncirculations can be driven by interaction of the interior convection with the\noverlying atmosphere, as well as self-organization of patchiness due to\ncloud-dynamical-radiative feedbacks. Finally, irradiated brown dwarfs help to\nbridge the gap between these classes of objects, experiencing intense external\nirradiation as well as vigorous interior convection. A hierarchy of modeling\napproaches have yielded major new insights into the dynamics governing these\nphenomena.",
