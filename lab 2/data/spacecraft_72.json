To obtain deeper insight into the issues of\nplasma physics, the so-called ``intrinsic'' difference in gamma_1 is extracted,\nthat is, the difference due to the change in the equation of state alone. Our\nmethod uses reference models based on two equations of state currently used in\nsolar modeling, the Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen (MHD) equation of state, and the OPAL\nequation of state (developed at Livermore). Solar oscillation frequencies from\nthe SOI/MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft during its first 144 days\nin operation are used. Our results confirm the existence of a subtle effect of\nthe excited states in hydrogen that was previously studied only theoretically\n(Nayfonov & Dappen 1998). The effect stems from internal partition function of\nhydrogen, as used in the MHD equation of state. Although it is a pure-hydrogen\neffect, it takes place in somewhat deeper layers of the Sun, where more than\n90% of hydrogen is ionized, and where the second ionization zone of helium is\nlocated. Therefore, the effect will have to be taken into account in reliable\nhelioseismic determinations of the astrophysically relevant helium-abundance of\nthe solar convection zone.",

The\nmost prominent features observed are highly time variable dust streams recorded\nthroughout the Jovian system. The impact rate varied by more than an order of\nmagnitude with a 5 and 10 hour periodicity, which shows a correlation with\nGalileo's position relative to the Jovian magnetic field. This behavior can be\nqualitatively explained by strong coupling of nanometer-sized dust to the\nJovian magnetic field. In addition to the 5 and 10 h periodicities, a longer\nperiod which is compatible with Io's orbital period is evident in the dust\nimpact rate. This feature indicates that Io most likely is the source of the\ndust streams. During a close (3,095 km altitude) flyby at Ganymede on 5 April\n1997 an enhanced rate of dust impacts has been observed, which suggests that\nGanymede is a source of ejecta particles. Within a distance of about 25 $\\rm\nR_J$ (Jupiter radius, $\\rm R_J = 71,492$ km) from Jupiter impacts of\nmicrometer-sized particles have been recorded which could be particles on bound\norbits about Jupiter.",

A relatively constant\nimpact rate of interplanetary and interstellar (big) particles of 0.4 impacts\nper day was detected over the whole three-year time span. In the outer solar\nsystem (outside about 2.6 AU) they are mostly of interstellar origin, whereas\nin the inner solar system they are mostly interplanetary particles. Within\nabout 1.7 AU from Jupiter intense streams of small dust particles were detected\nwith impact rates of up to 20,000 per day whose impact directions are\ncompatible with a Jovian origin. Two different populations of dust particles\nwere detected in the Jovian magnetosphere: small stream particles during\nGalileo's approach to the planet and big particles concentrated closer to\nJupiter between the Galilean satellites. There is strong evidence that the dust\nstream particles are orders of magnitude smaller in mass and faster than the\ninstrument's calibration, whereas the calibration is valid for the big\nparticles. Because the data transmission rate was very low, the complete data\nset for only a small fraction (2525) of all detected particles could be\ntransmitted to Earth; the other particles were only counted.

These \"non-triggered\" bursts\ncan be combined with the \"triggered\" bursts detected onboard to produce a GRB\nintensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of 2 lower than could\nbe studied previously. The value of the V/Vmax statistic (in Euclidean space)\nfor the bursts we detect is 0.177 +/- 0.006. This surprisingly low value is\nobtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time\nscales (where most bursts have their highest signal-to-noise ratio) that were\nnot already detected on the 1.024 s time scale. If allowance is made for a\npower-law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities, the extended peak flux\ndistribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of\nthe gamma-ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the\nUniverse. We argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which\nthe burst rate is independent of redshift. We use the peak flux distribution to\nderive a limit of 10% (99% confidence) on the fraction of the total burst rate\nthat could be contributed by a spatially homogeneous (in Euclidean space)\nsubpopulation of burst sources, such as type Ib/c supernovae. These results\nlend support to the conclusions of previous studies predicting that relatively\nfew faint \"classical\" GRBs will be found below the BATSE onboard detection\nthreshold.",

A non-linear Monte Carlo technique\nwas employed, which in effect solves the Boltzmann equation and is not\nrestricted to near-isotropic particle distribution functions. This technique\nmodels the injection of thermal and pickup ions, the acceleration of these\nions, and the determination of the shock structure under the influence of the\naccelerated ions. The essential effects of injection are treated in a mostly\nself-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-field\ndiffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. Using recent determinations of pickup\nion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs\nby assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination\nshock, are much less than an AU and that modestly strong cross-field diffusion\noccurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ or\nO$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ to within a factor $\\sim 5$. If the conditions of strong\nscattering apply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and the\ninjection and acceleration of pickup ions at the termination shock is totally\nanalogous to the injection and acceleration of ions at highly oblique\ninterplanetary shocks recently observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. The fact\nthat ACR fluxes can be modeled with standard shock assumptions suggests that\nthe much-discussed \"injection problem\" for highly oblique shocks stems from\nincomplete (either mathematical or computer) modeling of these shocks rather\nthan from any actual difficulty shocks may have in injecting and accelerating\nthermal or quasi-thermal particles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The DIRBE on the COBE spacecraft was designed primarily to conduct systematic\nsearch for an isotropic CIB in ten photometric bands from 1.25 to 240 microns.\nThe results of that search are presented here. Conservative limits on the CIB\nare obtained from the minimum observed brightness in all-sky maps at each\nwavelength, with the faintest limits in the DIRBE spectral range being at 3.5\nmicrons (\\nu I_\\nu < 64 nW/m^2/sr, 95% CL) and at 240 microns (\\nu I_\\nu < 28\nnW/m^2/sr, 95% CL). The bright foregrounds from interplanetary dust scattering\nand emission, stars, and interstellar dust emission are the principal\nimpediments to the DIRBE measurements of the CIB. These foregrounds have been\nmodeled and removed from the sky maps. Assessment of the random and systematic\nuncertainties in the residuals and tests for isotropy show that only the 140\nand 240 microns data provide candidate detections of the CIB. The residuals and\ntheir uncertainties provide CIB upper limits more restrictive than the dark sky\nlimits at wavelengths from 1.25 to 100 microns. No plausible solar system or\nGalactic source of the observed 140 and 240 microns residuals can be\nidentified, leading to the conclusion that the CIB has been detected at levels\nof \\nu I_\\nu = 25+-7 and 14+-3 nW/m^2/sr at 140 and 240 microns respectively.\nThe integrated energy from 140 to 240 microns, 10.3 nW/m^2/sr, is about twice\nthe integrated optical light from the galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field,\nsuggesting that star formation might have been heavily enshrouded by dust at\nhigh redshift. The detections and upper limits reported here provide new\nconstraints on models of the history of energy-releasing processes and dust\nproduction since the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background from matter.",

The GAIA\nmission concept follows the dramatic success of the ESA HIPPARCOS mission,\nutilising a continuously scanning spacecraft, accurately measuring 1-D\ncoordinates along great circles, in (at least) two simultaneous fields of view,\nseparated by a known angle. These 1-D relative coordinates are later converted\nto the five astrometric parameters of position and motions in a global\nanalysis. GAIA will provide precise astrometry and multi-colour photometry for\nall the one billion stars, quasars, and compact galaxies to I=20 on the sky.\nGAIA will additionally provide the sixth phase-space parameter, radial\nvelocity, from a slitless spectroscopic survey of most stars brighter than\nabout magnitude 17. The technical challenges are considerable, but achievable.\nThe scientific returns are spectacular, with greatest impact in the study of\nstellar populations and dynamical structure of the galaxies of our Local Group,\nand in providing the first complete census of the stars and massive planets in\nthe Solar neighbourhood.

In order to answer this question, we determined the blue\nand red intensities of the radiation from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM)\nand examined the red intensity for the presence of an excess above that\nexpected for scattered light. The diffuse ISM blue and red intensities were\nobtained by subtracting the integrated star and galaxy intensities from the\nblue and red measurements made by the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) aboard the\nPioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The color of the diffuse ISM was found to be\nredder than the Pioneer intensities, contrary to that expected for scattered\nlight (Diffuse Galactic Light [DGL]). The red DGL was calculated using the blue\ndiffuse ISM intensities and the approximately invariant color of the DGL\ncalculated with the DGL model. Subtracting the calculated red DGL from the red\ndiffuse ISM intensities resulted in the detection of an excess red intensity.\nThis represents the likely detection of ERE in the diffuse ISM since H-alpha\nemission cannot account for the strength of this excess and the only other\nknown emission process applicable to the diffuse ISM is ERE. Thus, ERE appears\nto be a general characteristic of dust. From the correlation between N_HI and\nERE intensity the ERE photon conversion efficiency was estimated at 10 +/- 3%.",

That technique,\nincorporated into a fully dynamical diffusion-convection formalism, was\nrecently introduced for parallel shocks by Kang \\& Jones (1995). Here, we have\ncompared results of time dependent numerical simulations using our technique\nwith Monte Carlo simulations by Ellison, Baring \\& Jones 1995 and with {\\it in\nsitu} observations from the Ulysses spacecraft of oblique interplanetary shocks\ndiscussed by Baring \\etal (1995). Through the success of these comparisons we\nhave demonstrated that our {diffusion-convection} method and injection\ntechniques provide a practical tool to capture essential physics of the\ninjection process and particle acceleration at oblique MHD shocks. In addition\nto the diffusion-convection simulations, we have included time dependent\ntwo-fluid simulations for a couple of the shocks to demonstrate the basic\nvalidity of that formalism in the oblique shock context. Using simple models\nfor the two-fluid closure parameters based on test-particle considerations, we\nfind good agreement with the dynamical properties of the more detailed\ndiffusion-convection results. We emphasize, however, that such two-fluid\nresults can be sensitive to the properties of these closure parameters when the\nflows are not truly steady. Furthermore, we emphasize through example how the\nvalidity of the two-fluid formalism does not necessarily mean that {\\it\nsteady-state} two-fluid models provide a reliable tool for predicting the\nefficiency of particle acceleration in real shocks.",

To make full use of this\ninformation, an experiment must image the entire sky with the angular\nresolution, sensitivity, and spectral coverage necessary to reach the limits\nset by cosmic variance on angular scales >~10'. Recent progress in detector\ntechnology allows this to be achieved by a properly designed space mission that\nfits well within the scope of NASA's Medium-class Explorer program. An\nessential component of the mission design is an observing strategy that\nminimizes systematic effects due to instrumental offset drifts. The detector\nadvances make possible a `spin chopping' approach that has significant\ntechnical and scientific advantages over the strategy used by COBE, which\nreconstructed an image of the sky via inversion of a large matrix of\ndifferential measurements. The advantages include increased angular resolution,\nincreased sensitivity, and simplicity of instrumentation and spacecraft\noperations. For the parameters typical of experiments like the Primordial\nStructures Investigation (PSI) and the Far InfraRed Explorer (FIRE), we show\nthat the spin-chopping strategy produces images of the sky and power spectra of\nCMB anisotropies that contain no significant systematic artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The high state of black hole candidates is characterized by a quasi- thermal\nemission component at $kT \\sim 1$ keV. In addition, this state tends to have\nvery low variability which indicates that it is relatively stable, at least on\n{\\it short} time scales. Most models of the high state imply that the bulk of\nthe emission comes from an optically thick accretion disc; therefore, this\nstate may be an excellent laboratory for testing our ideas about the physics of\naccretion discs. In this work we consider the implications of assuming that\naccretion disc viscosity arises from some form of turbulence. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple case of three dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. It is\nfound that the coupling of such turbulence to acoustic modes in the disc can\nalter the disc emission. We calculate the amplitude and frequencies of this\nmodulation, and we express our results in terms of the X-ray power spectral\ndensity. We compare our calculations with observations of the black hole\ncandidate GS 1124-683, and show that for certain parameters we can reproduce\nsome of the high frequency power. We then briefly explore mechanisms for\nproducing the low frequency power, and note the difficulty that a single\nvariability mechanism has in reproducing the full range of observed\nvariability. In addition, we outline ways in which future spacecraft missions\n-- such as USA and XTE -- can further constrain our model, especially at\nfrequencies above $\\sim 10^2$ Hz.",
