    "abstract": "Abstract:  3D visual tracking is significant to deep space exploration programs, which\ncan guarantee spacecraft to flexibly approach the target. In this paper, we\nfocus on the studied accurate and real-time method for 3D tracking. Considering\nthe fact that there are almost no public dataset for this topic, A new\nlarge-scale 3D asteroid tracking dataset is presented, including binocular\nvideo sequences, depth maps, and point clouds of diverse asteroids with various\nshapes and textures. Benefitting from the power and convenience of simulation\nplatform, all the 2D and 3D annotations are automatically generated. Meanwhile,\nwe propose a deep-learning based 3D tracking framework, named as Track3D, which\ninvolves 2D monocular tracker and a novel light-weight amodal axis-aligned\nbounding-box network, A3BoxNet. The evaluation results demonstrate that Track3D\nachieves state-of-the-art 3D tracking performance in both accuracy and\nprecision, comparing to a baseline algorithm. Moreover, our framework has great\ngeneralization ability to 2D monocular tracking performance.",

The spacecraft\nhosts two UV-optimized delta-doped charge-coupled devices fed by a 9-cm\ntelescope and a dichroic beam splitter. A dedicated science payload processor\nperforms near real-time onboard science image processing to dynamically change\ndetector integration times and gains to reduce the occurrence of pixel\nsaturation during strong M dwarf flaring events and provide adequate flare\nlight curve structure resolution while enabling the detection of low-amplitude\nrotational modulation. The processor independently controls the NUV and FUV\ndetectors. For each detector, it derives control updates from the most recent\ncompleted exposure and applies them to the next exposure. The detection of a\nflare event in the NUV channel resets the exposure in the FUV channel with new\nexposure parameters. Implementation testing of the control algorithm using\nsimulated light curves and full-frame images demonstrates a robust response to\nthe quiescent and flaring levels expected for the stars to be monitored by the\nmission. The SPARCS onboard autonomous exposure control algorithm is adaptable\nfor operation in future point source-targeting space-based and ground-based\nobservatories geared towards the monitoring of extreme transient astrophysics\nphenomena.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  When analyzing plasma waves, a key parameter to determine is the phase\nvelocity. It enables us to, for example, compute wavelengths, wave potentials,\nand determine the energy of resonant particles. The phase velocity of a wave,\nobserved by a single spacecraft equipped with electric field probes, can be\ndetermined using interferometry techniques. While several methods have been\ndeveloped to do this, they have not been documented in detail. In this study,\nwe use an analytical model to analyze and compare three interferometry methods\napplied on the probe geometry of the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. One\nmethod relies on measured probe potentials, whereas the other two use different\nE-field measurements: one by reconstructing the E-field between two probes and\nthe spacecraft, the other by constructing four pairwise parallel E-field\ncomponents in the spacecraft spin-plane. We find that the potential method is\nsensitive both to how planar the wave is, and to spacecraft potential changes\ndue to the wave. The E-field methods are less affected by the spacecraft\npotential, and while the reconstructed E-field method is applicable in some\ncases, the second E-field method is almost always preferable. We conclude that\nthe potential based interferometry method is useful when spacecraft potential\neffects are negligible and the signals of the different probes are very well\ncorrelated. The method using two pairs of parallel E-fields is practically\nalways preferable to the reconstructed E-field method and produces the correct\nvelocity in the spin-plane, but it requires knowledge of the propagation\ndirection to provide the full velocity.",

A better understanding of the role of\nsuprathermal particles as seed populations for SEP events can be made by using\nobservations close to the Sun. We study a series of SEP events observed by the\nIntegrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS$\\odot$IS) suite on board the\nParker Solar Probe (PSP) from 2020 May 27 to June 2, during which PSP was at\nheliocentric distances between $\\sim$0.4 and $\\sim$0.2 au. These events were\nalso observed by the Ahead Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO-A)\nnear 1 au, but the particle intensity magnitude was much lower than that at\nPSP. We find that the SEPs should have spread in space as their source regions\nwere distant from the nominal magnetic footpoints of both spacecraft, and the\nparent CMEs were slow and narrow. We study the decay phase of the SEP events in\nthe $\\sim$1-2 MeV proton energy range at PSP and STEREO-A, and discuss their\nproperties in terms of both continuous injections by successive solar eruptions\nand the distances where the measurements were made. This study indicates that\nseed particles can be continuously generated by eruptions associated with slow\nand narrow CMEs, spread over a large part of the inner heliosphere, and remain\nthere for tens of hours, even if minimal particle intensity enhancements were\nmeasured near 1 au.",

For a long-term human presence\non Mars to be established, serious thought would need to be given to\nterraforming the planet. One major requirement for such terraforming is having\nthe protection of a planetary magnetic field which Mars currently does not\nhave. In this article we explore comprehensively for the first time, the\npractical and engineering challenges that affect the feasibility of creating an\nartificial magnetic field capable of encompassing Mars. This includes the\nconcerns that define the design, where to locate the magnetic field generator\nand possible construction strategies. The rationale here is not to justify the\nneed for a planetary magnetosphere but to put figures on the practicalities so\nas to be able to weigh the pros and cons of the different engineering\napproaches.\nThe optimum solution proposed is completely novel, although inspired by\nnatural situations and fusion plasma techniques. The solution with the lowest\npower, assembly and mass is to create an artificial charged particle ring\n(similar in form to a \"radiation belt\"), around the planet possibly formed by\nejecting matter from one of the moons of Mars (in fashion similar to that that\nforms the Io-Jupiter plasma torus), but using electromagnetic and plasma waves\nto drive a net current in the ring(s) that results in an overall magnetic\nfield.\nWith a new era of space exploration underway, this is the time to start\nthinking about these new and bold future concepts and to begin filling\nstrategic knowledge gaps. Furthermore, the principles explored here are also\napplicable to smaller scale objects like manned spacecraft, space stations or\nmoon bases, which would benefit from the creation of protective\nmini-magnetospheres.",

The 3- D shape models for the\ntwo asteroids are based on the Galileo spacecraft fly-by mission. Based on our\nnovel thermal evolutionary code for the precise shape of the asteroids we found\nthat the small planetary bodies that accreted within the initial 2-3 million\nyears (Myr) experienced sintering, whereas, the bodies formed afterwards were\nleft unconsolidated, e.g., as a rubble pile. The former set of bodies could\nhave formed by direct aggregation of nebula dust. Whereas, the majority of the\nrubble pile type small planetary bodies accreted latter by the assemblage of\nthe fragmented debris of the initially existing planetesimals. These bodies\ncooled over tens of million years. Generations of small planetesimals formed\nover time in the early solar system evolved from an ensemble of compact\nconsolidated bodies to rubble pile bodies due to collision induced\nfragmentation and re-accretion.",

Fringes between the ground array and the Space Radio\nTelescope were detected up to baseline lengths of 8.1 Earth diameters,\nproviding unprecedented resolution for 3C 84 at these wavelengths -- the\ncorresponding fringe spacing is 125 $\\mu$as at 5 GHz and 27 $\\mu$as at 22 GHz.\nOur space-VLBI images reveal previously unseen sub-structure inside the compact\n$\\sim 1$ pc long jet that was ejected about 10 years earlier. In the 5 GHz\nimage we detect for the first time low-intensity emission from a cocoon-like\nstructure around the restarted jet. This is to our knowledge the first time\nsuch a structure has been seen on the (sub-)parsec scale. Our results suggest\nthat the increased power of the young jet is inflating a bubble of hot plasma\nas it carves its way through the ambient medium of the central region of the\ngalaxy. We estimate the minimum energy stored in the mini-cocoon, its pressure,\nvolume, expansion speed, and the ratio of heavy particles to relativistic\nelectrons, as well as the density of the ambient medium. About half of the\nenergy delivered by the jet is dumped in the mini-cocoon and the\nquasi-spherical shape of the bubble suggests that this energy may be\ntransferred to a significantly larger volume of the ISM than that which the\nwell-collimated jet could do on its own. The pressure of the hot mini-cocoon\nalso provides a natural explanation for the almost cylindrical jet profile seen\nin the 22 GHz RadioAstron image.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  To design critical systems engineers must be able to prove that their system\ncan continue with its mission even after losing control authority over some of\nits actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly\nundesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no\ncontrol. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target\nafter a partial loss of control authority. However, after such a malfunction, a\nresilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to\nits initial capabilities. To quantify this loss of performance we introduce the\nnotion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio of the minimal times\nrequired to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive\ncomputation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a\ncomplex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear,\noptimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to\nprovide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience of control\nsystems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets. Relying on\ncontrol theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of\nquantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. We illustrate our\nmethod on two numerical examples: a trajectory controller for low-thrust\nspacecrafts and a UAV with eight propellers.",

A track is a block of multi-dimensional\ntime series from the beginning to end of DSN communication with the target\nspacecraft, containing thousands of monitor data items lasting several hours at\na frequency of 0.2-1Hz. Monitor data on each track reports on the performance\nof specific spacecraft operations and the DSN itself. DSN is receiving signals\nfrom 32 spacecraft across the solar system. DSN has pressure to reduce costs\nwhile maintaining the quality of support for DSN mission users. DSN Link\nControl Operators need to simultaneously monitor multiple tracks and identify\nanomalies in real time. DSN has seen that as the number of missions increases,\nthe data that needs to be processed increases over time. In this project, we\nlook at the last 8 years of data for analysis. Any anomaly in the track\nindicates a problem with either the spacecraft, DSN equipment, or weather\nconditions. DSN operators typically write Discrepancy Reports for further\nanalysis. It is recognized that it would be quite helpful to identify 10\nsimilar historical tracks out of the huge database to quickly find and match\nanomalies. This tool has three functions: (1) identification of the top 10\nsimilar historical tracks, (2) detection of anomalies compared to the reference\nnormal track, and (3) comparison of statistical differences between two given\ntracks. The requirements for these features were confirmed by survey responses\nfrom 21 DSN operators and engineers. The preliminary machine learning model has\nshown promising performance (AUC=0.92). We plan to increase the number of data\nsets and perform additional testing to improve performance further before its\nplanned integration into the track visualizer interface to assist DSN field\noperators and engineers.",

The literature shows that the concept of planet\ndeveloped by scientists during the Copernican Revolution was theory-laden and\npragmatic for science. It included both primaries and satellites as planets due\nto their common intrinsic, geological characteristics. About two centuries\nlater the non-scientific public had just adopted heliocentrism and was\nmotivated to preserve elements of geocentrism including teleology and the\nassumptions of astrology. This motivated development of a folk concept of\nplanet that contradicted the scientific view. The folk taxonomy was based on\nwhat an object orbits, making satellites out to be non-planets and ignoring\nmost asteroids. Astronomers continued to keep primaries and moons classed\ntogether as planets and continued teaching that taxonomy until the 1920s. The\nastronomical community lost interest in planets ca. 1910 to 1955 and during\nthat period complacently accepted the folk concept. Enough time has now elapsed\nso that modern astronomers forgot this history and rewrote it to claim that the\nfolk taxonomy is the one that was created by the Copernican scientists.\nStarting ca. 1960 when spacecraft missions were developed to send back detailed\nnew data, there was an explosion of publishing about planets including the\nsatellites, leading to revival of the Copernican planet concept. We present\nevidence that taxonomical alignment with geological complexity is the most\nuseful scientific taxonomy for planets. It is this complexity of both primary\nand secondary planets that is a key part of the chain of origins for life in\nthe cosmos.",

The loops can be interpreted as bundles of field\nlines, with the brightness of the bright loop indicative of lots of mass being\nloaded into those field lines, and with the dark loop being devoid of such mass\nloading. It is possible that these loops are actually representative of two\nindependent flux rope structures within the overall CME outline.",

The Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrometer (UVS) on board the\nLunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) spacecraft conducted a\nseries of Almost Limb activities to look for dust near the dawn terminator\nregion. During these activities the instrument stared at a fixed point in the\nzodiacal background off the Moon's limb while the spacecraft moved in\nretrograde orbit from the sunlit to the unlit side of the Moon. The spectra\nobtained from these activities probe altitudes within a few kilometers of the\nMoon's surface, a region whose dust populations were not well constrained by\nprevious remote-sensing observations from orbiting spacecraft. Filtering these\nspectra to remove a varying instrumental signal enables constraints to be\nplaced on potential signals from a dust atmosphere. These filtered spectra are\ncompared with those predicted for dust atmospheres with various exponential\nscale heights and particle size distributions to yield upper limits on the dust\nnumber density for these potential populations. For a differential size\ndistribution proportional to $s^{-3}$ (where $s$ is the particle size) and a\nscale height of 1 km, we obtain an upper limit on the number density of dust\nparticles at the Moon's surface of 142 $m^{-3}$.",

These radio emissions,\nin the range of a few kHz to 1 MHz, are emitted by electrons travelling around\nauroral magnetic field lines. Their study is useful to understand the\nvariability of a magnetosphere and its coupling with the solar wind. Previous\nstudies have shown a strong correlation between the solar wind pressure and the\nSKR intensity. However, up to now, the effect of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass\nEjection (ICME) has never been examined in detail, due to the lack of SKR\nobservations at the time when an ICME can be tracked and its different parts be\nclearly identified. In this study, we take advantage of a large ICME that\nreached Saturn mid-November 2014 (Witasse et al., 2017). At that time, the\nCassini spacecraft was fortunately travelling within the solar wind for a few\ndays, and provided a very accurate timing of the ICME structure. A survey of\nthe Cassini data for the same period indicated a significant increase in the\nSKR emissions, showing a good correlation after the passage of the ICME shock\nwith a delay of 13 hours and after the magnetic cloud passage with a delay of\n25-42 hours.

Recovery of this faint signal was technically challenging. The bright\nring of sunlight forward-scattered by haze in the Plutonian atmosphere\nencircling the nightside hemisphere was severely overexposed, defeating the\nstandard smeared-charge removal required for LORRI images. Reconstruction of\nthe overexposed portions of the raw images, however, allowed adequate\ncorrections to be accomplished. The small solar elongation of Pluto during the\ndeparture phase also generated a complex scattered-sunlight background in the\nimages that was three orders of magnitude stronger than the estimated\nCharon-light flux (the Charon-light flux is similar to the flux of moonlight on\nEarth a few days before first quarter). A model background image was\nconstructed for each Pluto image based on principal component analysis (PCA)\napplied to an ensemble of scattered-sunlight images taken at identical\nSun-spacecraft geometry to the Pluto images. The recovered Charon-light image\nrevealed a high-albedo region in the southern hemisphere. We argue that this\nmay be a regional deposit of N_2 or CH_4 ice. The Charon-light image also shows\nthat the south polar region currently has markedly lower albedo than the north\npolar region of Pluto, which may reflect the sublimation of N_2 ice or the\ndeposition of haze particulates during the recent southern summer.",

EOS is based on HELIOS and HELIOS-K, which are novel and publicly\navailable atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) codes optimized for fast\ncalculations with GPU processors. These codes were originally developed for the\nstudy of giant planets. In this paper we present an adaptation for applications\nto terrestrial-type, habitable planets, adding specific physical recipes for\nthe gas opacity and vertical structure of the atmosphere. To test the\nreliability of the procedure we assessed the impact of changing line opacity\nprofile, continuum opacity model, atmospheric lapse rate and tropopause\nposition prescriptions on the OLR and the TOA albedo. The results obtained with\nEOS are in line with those of other RT codes running on traditional CPU\nprocessors, while being at least one order of magnitude faster. The adoption of\nOLR and TOA albedo data generated with EOS in a zonal and seasonal climate\nmodel correctly reproduce the fluxes of the present-day Earth measured by the\nCERES spacecraft. The results of this study disclose the possibility to\nincorporate fast RT calculations in climate models aimed at characterizing the\natmospheres of habitable exoplanets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present first science observations taken during the commissioning\nactivities of the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE)\ninstrument on the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter mission. SPICE is a high-resolution\nimaging spectrometer operating at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. In\nthis paper we illustrate the possible types of observations to give prospective\nusers a better understanding of the science capabilities of SPICE. The paper\ndiscusses the first observations of the Sun on different targets and presents\nan example of the full spectra from the quiet Sun, identifying over 40 spectral\nlines from neutral hydrogen and ions of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon,\nsulphur, magnesium, and iron. These lines cover the temperature range between\n20,000 K and 1 million K (10MK in flares), providing slices of the Sun's\natmosphere in narrow temperature intervals. We provide a list of count rates\nfor the 23 brightest spectral lines. We show examples of raster images of the\nquiet Sun in several strong transition region lines, where we have found\nunusually bright, compact structures in the quiet Sun network, with extreme\nintensities up to 25 times greater than the average intensity across the image.\nThe lifetimes of these structures can exceed 2.5 hours. We identify them as a\ntransition region signature of coronal bright points and compare their areas\nand intensity enhancements. We also show the first above-limb measurements with\nSPICE above the polar limb in C III, O VI, and Ne VIII lines, and far off limb\nmeasurements in the equatorial plane in Mg IX, Ne VIII, and O VI lines. We\ndiscuss the potential to use abundance diagnostics methods to study the\nvariability of the elemental composition that can be compared with in situ\nmeasurements to help confirm the magnetic connection between the spacecraft\nlocation and the Sun's surface, and locate the sources of the solar wind.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method for laser frequency stabilisation in the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission by locking a laser to two\nstable length references - the arms of the interferometer and an on-board\noptical cavity. The two references are digitally fused using carefully designed\ncontrol systems, ensuring no changes to the baseline LISA mission hardware are\nrequired. The interferometer arm(s) provides the most stable reference\navailable in the LISA science band (0.1 mHz - 1 Hz), while the cavity sensor's\nwide-band and linear readout enables additional control system gain below and\nabove the LISA band. The main technical issue with this dual sensor approach is\nthe undesirable slow laser frequency pulling which couples into the control\nsystem with the imperfect knowledge of the Doppler shift of the light due to\nrelative spacecraft motion along the LISA arm. This paper outlines requirements\non the Doppler shift knowledge to maintain the cavity well within the resonance\nwhen activating the fused control system. Two Doppler shift estimation methods\nare presented that use the already on-board measurements, the inter-spacecraft\ninterferometer link (the main science measurement), and the absolute\ninter-spacecraft laser ranging system. Both methods reach the required\nprecision after a few thousand seconds of measurement integration. The paper\ndemonstrates an approach to initialise and engage the proposed laser\nstabilization system, starting from free-running laser and ending with the dual\nsensor frequency control system. The results show that the technique lowers the\nresidual laser frequency noise in the LISA science band by over 3 orders of\nmagnitude, potentially allowing the requirements on Time-Delay-Interferometry\n(TDI) to be relaxed - possibly to the point where first-generation TDI may be\nsufficient.",

Titan is also one of the few places in\nthe Solar System with habitability potential. Titan remarkable nature was only\npartly revealed by the Cassini-Huygens mission and still holds mysteries\nrequiring a complete exploration using a variety of vehicles and instruments.\nThe proposed mission concept POSEIDON (Titan POlar Scout/orbitEr and In situ\nlake lander DrONe explorer) would perform joint orbital and in situ\ninvestigations of Titan. It is designed to build on and exceed the scope and\nscientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens, exploring Titan in\nways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up and\nin situ coverage over long periods of time. In the proposed mission\narchitecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a\nlarge set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a\nlow-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components,\ni.e. a lake lander, a \"heavy\" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of\nmini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the polar regions. The ideal\narrival time at Titan would be slightly before the next northern Spring equinox\n(2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to monitor still largely\nunknown atmospheric and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan\nnorthern latitudes with an orbiter and in situ element(s) would be highly\ncomplementary with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission that will\nprovide in situ exploration of Titan equatorial regions in the mid-2030s.",

In this paper we present such\nobservations for which the active active region 12765, begetter of type III, J,\nand U solar bursts, was within sight of ground-based instruments and behind the\nsolar limb of the PSP spacecraft. We used a subarray of the Giant Ukrainian\nRadio Telescope (GURT) to get the spectral properties of radio bursts at the\nfrequency range of 8-80 MHz, as well as the PSP radio instruments with a\nbandwidth of 10.5 kHz - 19.2 MHz, during solar observations on June 5, 2020. We\ndirectly detected the radio events initiated by the active region behind the\nsolar limb of the PSP spacecraft, using special conditions in the solar corona,\ndue to the absence of active regions from the PSP side. Following the\ngeneration mechanism of solar radio emission, we refined the density model for\nthe solar corona above the active region 12765 responsible for the radio\nbursts. Based on the PSP spacecraft position near the Sun and delays of radio\nwaves between space- and ground-based records, we found the corresponding radio\nresponses on the PSP spectrogram. The absence of sunspots from the PSP side\ncontributes to the propagation of radio waves from a dense loop of the Sun to\nquiet regions with low densities, through which PSP instruments can detect the\nradiation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft is performing the first in situ\nexploration of the solar wind within 0.2 au of the Sun. Initial observations\nconfirmed the Alfv\u00e9nic nature of aligned fluctuations of the magnetic field B\nand velocity V in solar wind plasma close to the Sun, in domains of nearly\nconstant magnetic field magnitude $|{\\bf B}|$, i.e., approximate magnetic\npressure balance. Such domains are interrupted by particularly strong\nfluctuations, including but not limited to radial field (polarity) reversals,\nknown as switchbacks. It has been proposed that nonlinear Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities form near magnetic boundaries in the nascent solar wind leading\nto extensive shear-driven dynamics, strong turbulent fluctuations including\nswitchbacks, and mixing layers that involve domains of approximate magnetic\npressure balance. In this work we identify and analyze various aspects of such\ndomains using data from the first five PSP solar encounters. The filling\nfraction of domains, a measure of Alfv\u00e9nicity, varies from median values of\n90% within 0.2 au to 38% outside 0.9 au, with strong fluctuations. We find an\ninverse association between the mean domain duration and plasma $\\beta$. We\nexamine whether the mean domain duration is also related to the crossing time\nof spatial structures frozen into the solar wind flow for extreme cases of the\naspect ratio. Our results are inconsistent with long, thin domains aligned\nalong the radial or Parker spiral direction, and compatible with isotropic\ndomains, which is consistent with prior observations of isotropic density\nfluctuations or ``flocculae'' in the solar wind.",

Since the\nsimplest 2D current sheet configuration with monotonic $B_z$ was proven to be\nstable to the tearing mode, the focus of the instability investigation moved to\nmore specific configurations, e.g. kinetic current sheets with strong transient\nion currents and current sheets with non-monotonic $B_z$ (local $B_z$ minima\nor/and peaks). Stability of the latter current sheet configuration has been\nstudied both within kinetic and fluid approaches, whereas the investigation of\nthe transient ion effects were limited to kinetic models only. This paper aims\nto provide detailed analysis of stability of a multi-fluid current sheet\nconfiguration that mimics current sheets with transient ions. Using the system\nwith two field-aligned ion flows that mimic the effect of pressure\nnon-gyrotropy, we construct 1D current sheet with a finite $B_z$. This model\ndescribes well recent findings of very thin intense magnetotail current sheets.\nThe stability analysis of this two-ion model confirms the stabilizing effect of\nfinite $B_z$ and shows that the most stable current sheet is the one with\nexactly counter-streaming ion flows and zero net flow. Such field-aligned flows\nmay substitute the contribution of the pressure tensor nongyrotropy to the\nstress balance, but cannot overtake the stabilizing effect of $B_z$. Obtained\nresults are discussed in the context of magnetotail dynamical models and\nspacecraft observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space mission planning and spacecraft design are tightly coupled and need to\nbe considered together for optimal performance; however, this integrated\noptimization problem results in a large-scale Mixed-Integer Nonlinear\nProgramming (MINLP) problem, which is challenging to solve. In response to this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a new solution approach to this MINLP problem by\niterative solving a set of coupled subproblems via the augmented Lagrangian\ncoordination approach following the philosophy of Multi-disciplinary Design\nOptimization (MDO). The proposed approach leverages the unique structure of the\nproblem that enables its decomposition into a set of coupled subproblems of\ndifferent types: a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) subproblem for\nmission planning and one or more Nonlinear Programming (NLP) subproblem(s) for\nspacecraft design. Since specialized MIQP or NLP solvers can be applied to each\nsubproblem, the proposed approach can efficiently solve the otherwise\nintractable integrated MINLP problem. An automatic and effective method to find\nan initial solution for this iterative approach is also proposed so that the\noptimization can be performed without the need for a user-defined initial\nguess. In the demonstration case study, a human lunar exploration mission\nsequence is optimized with a subsystem-level parametric spacecraft design\nmodel. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the proposed formulation can\nobtain a better solution with a shorter computational time even without\nparallelization. For larger problems, the proposed solution approach can also\nbe easily parallelizable and thus is expected to be further advantageous and\nscalable.",

In this work we aim at testing a diagnostics\nmethod for this connectivity. This paper makes use of a coronal jet observed on\n2010 August 2nd in active region 11092 as a test for our connectivity method.\nThis combines solar EUV and in-situ data together with magnetic field\nextrapolation, large scale MHD modeling and FIP (First Ionization Potential)\nbias modeling to provide a global picture from the source region of the jet to\nits possible signatures at 1AU. Our data analysis reveals the presence of\noutflow areas near the jet which are within open magnetic flux regions and\nwhich present FIP bias consistent with the FIP model results. In our picture,\none of these open areas is the candidate jet source. Using a back-mapping\ntechnique we identified the arrival time of this solar plasma at the ACE\nspacecraft. The in-situ data show signatures of changes in the plasma and\nmagnetic field parameters, with FIP bias consistent with the possible passage\nof the jet material.

In an attempt to explain the existence\nof this swath of particles beyond Thebe's orbit, Hamilton and Kr\u00fcger (2008)\nproposed that the dust particle motion is driven by a shadow resonance caused\nby variable dust charging on the day and night side of Jupiter. However, the\nmodel by Divine (1983) together with recent observations by the Juno spacecraft\nindicates a warm and rather dense inner magnetosphere of Jupiter which implies\nthat the mechanism of the shadow resonance does not work.

We show that large (grain radii of a few\nmicrometers up to multi-micrometers) charged dust grains having significant\ninitial velocities oscillate in the Thebe extension. Smaller charged grains\n(with sub-micrometer radii) ejected from Thebe do not spend much time in the\nThebe extension and migrate into the Thebe ring. At the same time, if such\ngrains are ejected from larger dust grains in the Thebe extension due to\nfragmentation, they continue to oscillate within the Thebe extension for years.\nWe argue that fragmentation of large dust grains in the Thebe extension could\nbe the main source of sub-micrometer grains detected in the Thebe extension.",

An\noverwhelming majority of the observed waves are right hand circularly polarized\nin the solar wind frame and identified as outward propagating and quasi\nparallel whistler waves. Their occurrence rate increases by a least a factor\ntwo from 1 AU to 0.5 AU. These results are consistent with the regulation of\nthe heat flux by the whistler heat flux instability.

Given the\nplanned increase of government and private satellite presence in LEO, the need\nfor accurate density predictions for collision avoidance and lifetime\noptimization, particularly during extreme events, has become an urgent matter\nand requires comprehensive international collaboration. Additionally, long-term\nsolar activity models and historical data suggest that solar activity will\nsignificantly increase in the following years and decades.

We find that the performance of an\nempirical model with data assimilation is higher than its performance without\ndata assimilation during all extreme storm phases. We discuss how forecasting\nmodels can be improved by looking into two directions: first, to the past, by\nadapting historical extreme storm datasets for density predictions, and second,\nto the future, by facilitating the assimilation of large-scale thermosphere\ndata sets that will be collected in future events. Therefore, this topic is\nrelevant to the scientific community, government agencies that operate\nsatellites, and the private sector with assets operating in LEO.",

In the\nmany-to-many on-orbit repairing scenario, several servicing spacecrafts and\ntarget satellites are located in GEO orbits which have different inclination,\nRAAN and true anomaly. Each servicing spacecraft need to rendezvous with target\nsatellites to perform repairing missions under limited fuel. The mission\nobjective is to find the optimal servicing sequence and orbit rendezvous time\nof every servicing spacecraft to minimize total cost of all servicing\nspacecrafts with all target satellites repaired. Firstly, a time-dependent\norbital rendezvous strategy is proposed, which can handle the mission deadline\nconstraint. Besides, it is also cost-effective compared with the existing\nstrategy. Based on this strategy, the many-to-many on-orbit repairing mission\nplanning model can be simplified to an integer programming problem, which is\nestablished based on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW)\nmodel. In order to efficiently find a feasible optimal solution under\ncomplicated constraints, a hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm combining the\nlarge neighborhood search procedure is designed. The operations of \"destroy\"\nand \"repair\" are used on the elite individuals in each generation of the\ngenetic algorithm to enhance local search capabilities. Finally, the\nsimulations under different scenarios are carried out to verify the\neffectiveness of the presented algorithm and orbital rendezvous strategy, which\nperforms better than the traditional genetic algorithm.",
