    "abstract": "Abstract:  Due to the high-precision nature of the ASTROD (Astrodynamical Space Test of\nRelativity using Optical Devices) mission concept, the asteroid perturbations\non the ASTROD spacecraft is crucial. These perturbations need to be modelled\nand determined together with relativistic effects and other solar-system\nparameters. In a previous investigation (Su et al., Planetary and Space\nScience, 47, 339-43[1999]), we used the mass estimation of Ceres, Pallas and\nVesta in the literature to calculate their perturbations on the ASTROD\nspacecraft. Recently, we established an ephemeris framework (CGC 1) including\nthe 3 big asteroids and used this ephemeris framework to simulate the\ndetermination of their masses together with other solar-system parameters and\nrelativistic-gravity parameters. In this paper, we extend the CGC 1 to CGC 2\nephemeris framework to include 492 asteroids (with diameter > 65 km) . We then\nuse CGC 2 to simulate the determination of ten parameters -- the masses of\nCeres, Pallas and Vesta, the six average densities for the other 489 asteroids,\nclassified into C, S,M,E,G and U types, and the rate of change of the\ngravitational constant G. The fractional mass uncertainties for Ceres, Pallas\nand Vesta are about 10**(-3)-10**(-4); the fractional density uncertainties for\nsix types of asteroids are about 10**(-2)-10**(-3); that for G-dot/G is about\n10**(-14)-10**(-15)/yr. This mass and density determination will be useful for\nthe determination and understanding of the structure and origin of asteroids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  All powered spacecraft experience residual systematic acceleration due to\nanisotropy of the thermal radiation pressure and fuel leakage. The residual\nacceleration limits the accuracy of any test of gravity that relies on the\nprecise determination of the spacecraft trajectory. We describe a novel\ntwo-step laser ranging technique, which largely eliminates the effects of\nnon-gravity acceleration sources and enables celestial mechanics checks with\nunprecedented precision. A passive proof mass is released from the mother\nspacecraft on a solar system exploration mission. Retro-reflectors attached to\nthe proof mass allow its relative position to the spacecraft to be determined\nusing optical ranging techniques. Meanwhile, the position of the spacecraft\nrelative to the Earth is determined by ranging with a laser transponder. The\nvector sum of the two is the position, relative to the Earth, of the proof\nmass, the measurement of which is not affected by the residual accelerations of\nthe mother spacecraft. We also describe the mission concept of the Dark Matter\nExplorers (DMX), which will demonstrate this technology and will use it to test\nthe hypothesis that dark matter congregates around the sun. This hypothesis\nimplies a small apparent deviation from the inverse square law of gravity,\nwhich can be detected by a sensitive experiment. We expect to achieve an\nacceleration resolution of $\\sim 10^{-14} m/s^2$. DMX will also be sensitive to\nacceleration towards the galactic center, which has a value of $\\sim 10^{-10}\nm/s^2$. Since dark matter dominates the galactic acceleration, DMX can also\ntest whether dark matter obeys the equivalence principle to a level of 100 ppm\nby ranging to several proof masses of different composition from the mother\nspacecraft.",

Charging from sporadic solar events\ninvolving energetic protons was also investigated. Using an event-size\ndistribution model, we conclude that their impact on the LISA science data is\nmanageable. Several physical processes hitherto unexplored as potential\ncharging mechanisms have also been assessed.

A flexible data and operations system\nwill allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients,\nwith rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system.\nThe mission is currently funded for 2 years of operations and the spacecraft\nwill have a lifetime to orbital decay of ~8 years.

The material released from these comets could be (after\nionization) an important portion of the inner source of pickup ions (PUIs), as\nthe local mass flux of the inner source and cometary PUIs seem comparable. We\nindicate time intervals during the year when the cometary PUIs could be\nobserved from a spacecraft on the Earth's orbit (from the end of July until the\nend of the year) and show three time intervals when they should be observable\nby Ulysses (from its launch time until the end of 1990, from the end of\nNovember 1994 until mid-May 1995 and from February 2001 until the end of July,\n2001).

This spectrum is\nconsistent with that expected from charge exchange emission between the highly\nionized solar wind and either interstellar neutrals in the heliosphere or\nmaterial from Earth's exosphere. The emission is clearly seen as a low-energy\n(E<1.5 keV) spectral enhancement in one of a series of four observations of the\nHubble Deep Field North. The X-ray enhancement is concurrent with an\nenhancement in the solar wind measured by ACE, Wind, and SoHO spacecraft. The\nsolar wind enhancement reaches a flux level an order of magnitude more intense\nthan typical fluxes at 1 AU, and has a significantly enhanced O^{+7}/O^{+6}\nratio. Besides being of interest in its own right for studies of the solar\nsystem, this emission can have significant consequences for observations of\ncosmological objects. It can provide emission lines at zero redshift which are\nof particular interest in studies of diffuse thermal emission (e.g., O VII and\nO VIII), and which can therefore act as contamination in the spectra of objects\nwhich cover the entire detector field of view. We propose the use of solar wind\nmonitoring data as a diagnostic to screen for such possibilities.",

These structures are observed in the Wideband plasma\nwave instrument's waveform data as bipolar and tripolar pulses. These\nstructures are observed at all of the boundary layers, in the solar wind and\nmagnetosheath, and along auroral field lines at 4.5-6.5 Re. Using the Wideband\nwaveform data from the various Cluster spacecraft we have carried out a survey\nof the amplitudes and time durations of these structures and how these\nquantities vary with the local magnetic field strength. Such a survey has not\nbeen carried out before, and it reveals certain characteristics of solitary\nstructures in a finite magnetic field, a topic still inadequately addressed by\ntheories. We find that there is a broad range of electric field amplitudes at\nany specific magnetic field strength, and there is a general trend for the\nelectric field amplitudes to increase as the strength of the magnetic field\nincreases over a range of 5 to 500 nT. We provide a possible explanation for\nthis trend that releates to the structures being Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode\nsolitary waves. There is no corresponding dependence of the duration of the\nstructures on the magnetic field strength, although a plot of these two\nquantities reveals the unexpected result that with the exception of the\nmagnetosheath, all of the time durations for all of the other regions are\ncomparable, wheras the magnetosheath time durations clearly are in a different\ncategory of much smaller time duration. We speculate that this implies the\nstructures are much smaller in size.",

We show that the relativistic Hamiltonian 3+1\npoint of view, based on a 3+1 splitting of Minkowski space-time with a\nfoliation whose space-like leaves are both simultaneity and Cauchy surfaces,\nallows to find a solution to such problems, if we take into account M$\u00f8$ller's\ndefinition of allowed 4-coordinate transformations extended to radar\n4-coordinates. Rigidly rotating relativistic reference frames are shown not to\nexist. We give explicit foliations, with simultaneity surfaces (also space-like\nhyper-planes) non orthogonal to the non-inertial observer world-line, which\ncorrespond to a good notion of simultaneity for suitable (mutually balancing)\ntranslational and rotational accelerations. This allows to evaluate the\nsimultaneity-dependent one-way speed of light and to give the 3+1 description\nof both the rotating disk and the Sagnac effect. It is also shown how a GPS\nsystem of spacecrafts may establish a grid of admissible radar 4-coordinates\nand how the ACES mission can employ a variant of this method adapted to Earth's\nrotation in the evaluation of the one-way time transfer to detect the deviation\nfrom Einstein convention on the synchronization of inertial clocks implied by\nsuch a notion of simultaneity. We show that in parametrized Minkowski theories\nall the admissible notions of simultaneity are gauge equivalent ({\\it\nconventionality of simultaneity}) and, as an example, we describe Maxwell\ntheory in non-inertial systems with any admissible notion of simultaneity.",

In these\ndetectors the spacecraft-to-spacecraft light-travel-times will necessarily be\nunequal, time-varying, and (due to aberration) have different time delays on\nup- and down-links. Reduction of data from moving interferometric laser arrays\nin solar orbit will in fact encounter non-symmetric up- and downlink light time\ndifferences that are about 100 times larger than has previously been\nrecognized. The time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique uses knowledge of\nthese delays to cancel the otherwise dominant laser phase noise and yields a\nvariety of data combinations sensitive to gravitational waves. Under the\nassumption that the (different) up- and downlink time delays are constant, we\nderive the TDI expressions for those combinations that rely only on four\ninter-spacecraft phase measurements. We then turn to the general problem that\nencompasses time-dependence of the light-travel times along the laser links. By\nintroducing a set of non-commuting time-delay operators, we show that there\nexists a quite general procedure for deriving generalized TDI combinations that\naccount for the effects of time-dependence of the arms.

The 20th\ncentury had 15 transits of Mercury and the 21st century will have 14, the two\nmost recent occuring on 15 November 1999 and 7 May 2003. We report on our\nobservations and analyses of a black-drop effect at the 1999 and 2003 transits\nof Mercury seen in high spatial resolution optical imaging with NASA's\nTransition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft. We have separated\nthe primary contributors to this effect, solar limb darkening and broadening\ndue to the instrumental point spread function, for the 1999 event. The\nobservations are important for understanding historical observations of\ntransits of Venus, which in the 18th and 19th centuries were basic for the\ndetermination of the scale of the solar system. Our observations are in\npreparation for the 8 June 2004 transit of Venus, the first to occur since\n1882. Only five transits of Venus have ever been seen -- in 1639, 1761, 1769,\n1874, and 1882. These events occur in pairs, whose members are separated by 8\nyears, with an interval between pairs of 105 or 122 years. Nobody alive has\never seen a transit of Venus.",

We solve for the\nthree-dimensional geometries and mass distributions that enable the Uranian\nAlpha and Beta rings, and the Saturnian Maxwell and Colombo (Titan) rings, to\nmaintain simultaneous apsidal and nodal lock. Ring self-gravity, interparticle\ncollisions, and the quadrupole field of the host planet balance each other to\nachieve this equilibrium. We prove that such an equilibrium is linearly stable.\nPredictions for the Saturnian ringlets to be tested by the Cassini spacecraft\ninclude: (1) ringlet masses are of order 1e19 g, (2) surface mass densities\nshould increase from ring midline to ring edges, and (3) rings are vertically\nwarped such that the fractional variation of inclination across the ring is of\norder 10%. Analogous predictions are made for the Uranian rings. Simultaneous\napsidal and nodal locking forces the narrowest portion of the ring--its\n``pinch,'' where self-gravitational and collisional forces are strongest--to\ncirculate relative to the node, and introduces previously unrecognized\ntime-varying forces perpendicular to the planet's equator plane. We speculate\nthat such periodic stressing might drive kilometer-scale bending waves at a\nfrequency twice that of apsidal precession. Such flexing might be observed over\na few weeks by Cassini.",

These variations appear uncorrelated with asteroids physical\ncharacteristics such as diameter (in the probed 1-10 km range), taxonomic\nclass, and family membership. Despite such a lack of correlation, which implies\na random nature for the cause of color variability, a suite of tests suggest\nthat the detected variations are not instrumental effects. In particular, the\nobserved color variations are incompatible with photometric errors, and, for\nobjects observed at least four times, the color change in the first pair of\nobservations is correlated with the color change in the second pair. These\nfacts strongly suggest that the observed effect is real, and also indicate that\nfor some asteroids color variations are larger than for others. The detected\ncolor variations can be explained as due to inhomogeneous albedo distribution\nover an asteroid surface. Although relatively small, these variations suggest\nthat fairly large patches with different color than their surroundings exist on\na significant fraction of asteroids. This conclusion is in agreement with\nspatially resolved color images of several large asteroids obtained by NEAR\nspacecraft and HST.",

Mirror matter can interact with ordinary matter via gravity and\nvia the photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing interaction -- causing mirror\ncharged particles to couple to ordinary photons with effective electric charge\n$\\epsilon e$. This means that the nuclei of mirror atoms can elastically\nscatter off the nuclei of ordinary atoms, leading to nuclear recoils, which can\nbe detected in existing dark matter experiments. We show that the dark matter\nexperiments most sensitive to this type of dark matter candidate (via the\nnuclear recoil signature) are the DAMA/NaI and CRESST/Sapphire experiments.\nFurthermore, we show that the impressive annual modulation signal obtained by\nthe DAMA/NaI experiment can be explained by mirror matter-type dark matter for\n$|\\epsilon | \\sim 4 \\times 10^{-9}$ and is supported by DAMA's absolute rate\nmeasurement as well as the CRESST/Sapphire data.

Then we\ndemonstrate, in the framework of an exact cosmological solution of Einstein's\nfield equations which is valid both locally and globally, that the definition\nof inertial systems ultimately depends on this length-scale. As a consequence,\nusual local coordinates are not inertial, so that the motion of a free body of\nspeed v is expected to contain an additional constant acceleration\na_P=v^2(\\surd3 L_U), which is, using the WMAP five years results, (6.02 \\pm\n0.34) x 10^-8 cm/s^2 when v \\approx c. Such an effect is too small to\ncontribute significantly to the Pioneer acceleration (since v_Pioneer \\approx\n12 km/s << c), but could be possibly observed in a dedicated space mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Experiments aboard the Ulysses spacecraft discovered quasi-periodic bursts of\nrelativistic electrons and of radio emissions with ~40-minute period(QP-40)\nfrom the south pole of Jupiter in February 1992. Such polar QP-40 burst\nactivities were found to correlate well with arrivals of high-speed solar winds\nat Jupiter. We advance the physical scenario that the inner radiation belt(IRB)\nwithin ~2-3 Jupiter's radius, where ralativistic electrons are known to be\ntrapped via synchrotron emissions, can execute global QP-40 magnetoinertial\noscillations excited by arrivals of high-speed solar winds. Modulated by such\nQP-40 IRB oscillations, relativistic electrons trapped in the IRB may escape\nfrom the magnetic circumpolar regions during a certain phase of each 40-min\nperiod to form circumpolar QP-40 electron bursts. Highly beamed synchrotron\nemissions from such QP-40 burst electrons with small pitch angles relative to\nJovian magnetic field at ~30-40 Jupiter radius give rise to QP-40 radio bursts\nwith typical frequencies <0.2MHz. We predict that the synchrotron brightness of\nthe IRB should vary on QP-40 timescales upon arrivals of high-speed solar winds\nwith estimated magnitudes larger than 0.1Jy, detectable by ground-based radio\ntelescopes. Using the real-time solar wind data from the spacecraft ACE, we\nshow here that shch QP-40 pulsations of Jupiter's polar X-ray hot spot did in\nfact coincide with the arrival of high-speed solar wind at Jupiter.",
