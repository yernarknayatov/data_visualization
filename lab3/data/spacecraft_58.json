In\nprevious work we had developed a pipeline for map-making independently of the\nWMAP team. The new maps produced from the WMAP raw data by our pipeline are\nnotably different to the official ones, and the power spectrum as well as the\nbest-fit cosmological parameters are significantly different too. What's more,\nby revealing the inconsistency between the WMAP raw data and their official\nmap, we had pointed out that there must exist an unexpected problem in the WMAP\nteam's pipeline. In this work, we find that the trouble comes from the\ninaccuracy of antenna pointing direction caused by a systematical time drift\nbetween the attitude data and the science data in the WMAP raw time-order data\n(TOD). The CMB quadrupole in the WMAP release can be exactly generated from a\ndifferential dipole field which is completely determined by the spacecraft\nvelocity and the antenna directions without using any CMB signal. After\ncorrecting the WMAP team's error, the CMB quadrupole component disappears.\nTherefore, the released WMAP CMB quadrupole is almost completely artificial and\nthe real quadrupole of the CMB anisotropy should be near zero. Our finding is\nimportant for understanding the early universe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have measured the sub-milli-arcsecond structure of 274 extragalactic\nsources at 24 and 43 GHz in order to assess their astrometric suitability for\nuse in a high frequency celestial reference frame (CRF). Ten sessions of\nobservations with the Very Long Baseline Array have been conducted over the\ncourse of $\\sim$5 years, with a total of 1339 images produced for the 274\nsources. There are several quantities that can be used to characterize the\nimpact of intrinsic source structure on astrometric observations including the\nsource flux density, the flux density variability, the source structure index,\nthe source compactness, and the compactness variability. A detailed analysis of\nthese imaging quantities shows that (1) our selection of compact sources from\n8.4 GHz catalogs yielded sources with flux densities, averaged over the\nsessions in which each source was observed, of about 1 Jy at both 24 and 43\nGHz, (2) on average the source flux densities at 24 GHz varied by 20%-25%\nrelative to their mean values, with variations in the session-to-session flux\ndensity scale being less than 10%, (3) sources were found to be more compact\nwith less intrinsic structure at higher frequencies, and (4) variations of the\ncore radio emission relative to the total flux density of the source are less\nthan 8% on average at 24 GHz. We conclude that the reduction in the effects due\nto source structure gained by observing at higher frequencies will result in an\nimproved CRF and a pool of high-quality fiducial reference points for use in\nspacecraft navigation over the next decade.",

In our\nprevious theoretical study of the formation and initial motion of these density\nenhancements it is found that beyond the helmet cusp of a coronal streamer the\nmagnetized wake configuration is resistively unstable, that a traveling\nmagnetic island develops at the center of the streamer, and that density\nenhancements occur within the magnetic islands. As the massive magnetic island\ntravels outward, both its speed and width increase. The island passively traces\nthe acceleration of the inner part of the wake.\nIn the present paper a few spherical geometry effects are included, taking\ninto account either the radial divergence of the magnetic field lines and the\naverage expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward, using the\nExpanding Box Model (EBM), and the diamagnetic force due to the overall\nmagnetic field radial gradients, the so-called melon-seed force. It is found\nthat the values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good\nagreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the\nmagnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun and the initial\nstage of the formation and acceleration of the plasmoid is due to the cartesian\nevolution of MHD instabilities. This result provides a constraint on the\ntopology of the magnetic field in the coronal streamer.",

The implementation in Maude has the additional benefit of\nmaking available to PLEXIL designers and developers all the formal analysis and\nverification tools provided by Maude. The formalization of the PLEXIL semantics\nin rewriting logic poses an interesting challenge due to the synchronous nature\nof the language and the prioritized rules defining its semantics. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we propose a general procedure for simulating synchronous set\nrelations in rewriting logic that is sound and, for deterministic relations,\ncomplete.

In this paper we present some\nobservations of \"equatorial coronal hole jets\" made up with data provided by\nthe STEREO/SECCHI instruments during a period comprising March 2007 and\nDecember 2007.

For one event, the uplift velocity has been\ndetermined as about 200 km/s, while the deceleration rate appears to be about\n0.11 km/s2, less than solar gravity. The average jet visibility time is about\n30 minutes, consistent with jet observed in polar regions.

They have used disk-integrated\nintensity observations of the Sun obtained from the VIRGO (Variability of solar\nIRradiance and Gravity Oscillations) instrument on board SOHO (Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory) spacecraft. Similar signature of flares in velocity\nobservations has not been confirmed till now. The study of low-degree\nhigh-frequency waves in the Sun is important for our understanding of the\ndynamics of the deeper solar layers. In this paper, we present the analysis of\nthe velocity observations of the Sun obtained from the MDI (Michelson and\nDoppler Imager) and the GOLF (Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies)\ninstruments on board SOHO for some major flare events of the solar cycle 23.\nApplication of wavelet techniques to the time series of disk-integrated\nvelocity signals from the solar surface using the full-disk Dopplergrams\nobtained from the MDI clearly indicates that there is enhancement of\nhigh-frequency global waves in the Sun during the flares. This signature of\nflares is also visible in the Fourier Power Spectrum of these velocity\noscillations. On the other hand, the analysis of disk-integrated velocity\nobservations obtained from the GOLF shows only marginal evidence of effects of\nflares on high-frequency oscillations.",

We compute the\nfractions of light that diffract past the UVCS external occulter and\nnon-specularly pass into the spectrometer slit. The diffracted component of the\nstray light depends on the finite aperture of the primary mirror and on its\nfigure. The amount of non-specular scattering depends mainly on the\nmicro-roughness of the mirror. For reasonable choices of these quantities, the\nmodeled stray-light fraction agrees well with measurements of stray light made\nboth in the laboratory and during the UVCS mission.

Ultimately, the drift was\ninterpreted as a constant sunward deceleration of each particular spacecraft at\nthe level of a_P = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^{-10} m/s^2. This apparent violation of\nthe Newton's gravitational inverse-square law has become known as the Pioneer\nanomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained. In this review, we\nsummarize the current knowledge of the physical properties of the anomaly and\nthe conditions that led to its detection and characterization. We review\nvarious mechanisms proposed to explain the anomaly and discuss the current\nstate of efforts to determine its nature. A comprehensive new investigation of\nthe anomalous behavior of the two Pioneers has begun recently. The new efforts\nrely on the much-extended set of radio-metric Doppler data for both spacecraft\nin conjunction with the newly available complete record of their telemetry\nfiles and a large archive of original project documentation. As the new study\nis yet to report its findings, this review provides the necessary background\nfor the new results to appear in the near future. In particular, we provide a\nsignificant amount of information on the design, operations and behavior of the\ntwo Pioneers during their entire missions, including descriptions of various\ndata formats and techniques used for their navigation and radio-science data\nanalysis. As most of this information was recovered relatively recently, it was\nnot used in the previous studies of the Pioneer anomaly, but it is critical for\nthe new investigation.",

Several instruments aboard Rosetta are\ndedicated to studying various aspects of dust in the cometary coma, all of\nwhich require a certain level of exposure to dust to achieve their goals. At\nthe same time, impacts of dust particles can constitute a hazard to the\nspacecraft. To conciliate the demands of dust collection instruments and\nspacecraft safety, it is desirable to assess the dust environment in the coma\neven before the arrival of Rosetta. We describe the present status of modelling\nthe dust coma of 67P/C-G and predict the speed and flux of dust in the coma,\nthe dust fluence on a spacecraft along sample trajectories, and the radiation\nenvironment in the coma. The model will need to be refined when more details of\nthe coma are revealed by observations. An overview of astronomical observations\nof 67P/C-G is given and model parameters are derived from these data where\npossible. For quantities not yet measured for 67P/C-G, we use values obtained\nfor other comets. One of the most important and most controversial parameters\nis the dust mass distribution. We summarise the mass distribution functions\nderived from the in-situ measurements at comet 1P/Halley in 1986. For 67P/C-G,\nconstraining the mass distribution is currently only possible by the analysis\nof astronomical images. We find that the results from such analyses are at\npresent rather heterogeneous, and we identify a need to find a model that is\nreconcilable with all available observations.",

Most of the bright points are smaller than about\n150 km. The larger points are mostly associated with the penumbral features.\nThe bright points are not uniformly distributed over the umbra but\npreferentially located around the penumbral boundary and in the fast decaying\nparts of umbra. The color temperature of the bright points, derived using the\ncontinuum irradiance, are in the range of 4600 K to 6600 K with cooler ones\nlocated in the umbra. The temperature increases as a function of distance from\nthe center to outside. The G-band, CN-band and CaII H flux of the bright points\nas a function of their blue band brightness increase continuously in a\nnonlinear fashion unlike their red and green counterpart. This is consistent\nwith a model in which the localized heating of the flux tube deplete the\nmolecular concentration resulting the reduced opacity which leads to the\nexposition of deeper and hotter layers. The scatter in CaII H irradiance is\nhigher compared to the G-band and CN-band irradiance. The light curve of the\nbright points show that the enhanced brightness at these locations last for\nabout 15 to 60 minutes with the least contrast for the points out side the\nspot.

They model the heating of\ncoronal loops in the solar atmosphere via the tangling of coronal field lines\nby photospheric footpoints motions within the framework of the \"Parker\nscenario\". We have derived scalings of physical quantities with loop length,\nand the ratio of photospheric to coronal Alfven velocities. The development of\na turbulent dynamics makes the dissipation rate independent of the Reynolds\nnumber. The dynamics in physical space are desribed by weak turbulence, which\ndevelops when an MHD system is embedded in a strong axial magnetic field.\nThe slow wind originates in and around the coronal streamer belt. The LASCO\ninstrument onboard the SOHO spacecraft has observed plasma density enhancements\nforming beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer. Previous theoretical models for\nthe formation and initial motion of these density enhancements are improved.\nThe average expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward, and\nthe diamagnetic force due to the overall magnetic field radial gradients are\nnow included. It is found that the magnetized wake configuration is resistively\nunstable, that an outward accelerating magnetic island develops at the center\nof the streamer, and that density enhancements occur within the magnetic\nislands. The values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good\nagreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the\nmagnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets\norbiting Solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.\nThe high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge\nof how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.\nThis information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF),\ndefined as the composite of Kepler's optical point spread function, integrated\nspacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic\neffects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a\npiecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous\nrepresentation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given\nthe star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial\nrepresentation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation\nin the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial\npatches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler\nfield of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection\nof pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratio\nfor that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate\nstellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale\ntracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the\nsuccessful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.",

Such\nprecision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days and\nsystematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. To this end, the spacecraft and\nphotometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data sets\ntaken to characterize the photometer performance. Because Kepler has no\nshutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, from\nwhich we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. These basic\ndetector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests,\nindicating that the photometer is working as expected. Several image artifacts\nhave proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a result\nof their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability in\nflight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on the\ntimescales of transits. Because of Kepler's unprecedented sensitivity and\nstability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affect\nphotometric precision. We are using the first 43 days of science data to\ncharacterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods that\nwill be implemented in the calibration pipeline. Based on early testing, we\nexpect to attain Kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of the\nfield of view.",

In this paper, we summarize\nthe design and performance of AMICA. In addition, we describe the calibration\nmethods, assumptions, and models, based on measurements. Major calibration\nsteps include corrections for linearity and modeling and subtraction of bias,\ndark current, read-out smear, and pixel-to-pixel responsivity variations. AMICA\nv-band data were calibrated to radiance using in-flight stellar observations.\nThe other band data were calibrated to reflectance by comparing them to\nground-based observations to avoid the uncertainty of the solar irradiation in\nthose bands. We found that the AMICA signal was linear with respect to the\ninput signal to an accuracy of << 1% when the signal level was < 3800 DN. We\nverified that the absolute radiance calibration of the AMICA v-band (0.55\nmicron) was accurate to 4% or less, the accuracy of the disk-integrated spectra\nwith respect to the AMICA v-band was about 1%, and the pixel-to-pixel\nresponsivity (flatfield) variation was 3% or less. The uncertainty in\nbackground zero-level was 5 DN. From wide-band observations of star clusters,\nwe found that the AMICA optics have an effective focal length of 120.80 \\pm\n0.03 mm, yielding a field-of-view (FOV) of 5.83 deg x 5.69 deg. The resulting\ngeometric distortion model was accurate to within a third of a pixel. We\ndemonstrated an image-restoration technique using the point-spread functions of\nstars, and confirmed that the technique functions well in all loss-less images.\nAn artifact not corrected by this calibration is scattered light associated\nwith bright disks in the FOV.",

To prepare for that flyby, Lutetia has been\nextensively observed by a variety of astronomical facilities. We used the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) to determine the albedo of Lutetia over a wide\nwavelength range, extending from ~150 nm to ~700 nm. Using data from a variety\nof HST filters and a ground-based visible light spectrum, we employed synthetic\nphotometry techniques to derive absolute fluxes for Lutetia. New results from\nground-based measurements of Lutetia's size and shape were used to convert the\nabsolute fluxes into albedos. We present our best model for the spectral energy\ndistribution of Lutetia over the wavelength range 120-800 nm. There appears to\nbe a steep drop in the albedo (by a factor of ~2) for wavelengths shorter than\n~300 nm. Nevertheless, the far ultraviolet albedo of Lutetia (~10%) is\nconsiderably larger than that of typical C-chondrite material (~4%). The\ngeometric albedo at 550 nm is 16.5 +/- 1%. Lutetia's reflectivity is not\nconsistent with a metal-dominated surface at infrared or radar wavelengths, and\nits albedo at all wavelengths (UV-visibile-IR-radar) is larger than observed\nfor typical primitive, chondritic material. We derive a relatively high FUV\nalbedo of ~10%, a result that will be tested by observations with the Alice\nspectrograph during the Rosetta flyby of Lutetia in July 2010.",

We observe six near-consecutive secondary eclipses of\nHAT-P-7b at optical wavelengths with the EPOXI spacecraft. We place an upper\nlimit on the relative eclipse depth of 0.055% (95% confidence). We also analyze\nSpitzer observations of the same target in the infrared, obtaining secondary\neclipse depths of 0.098+/-0.017%, 0.159+/-0.022%, 0.245+/-0.031% and\n0.225+/-0.052% in the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron IRAC bands respectively. We\ncombine these measurements with the recently published Kepler secondary eclipse\nmeasurement, and generate atmospheric models for the day-side of the planet\nthat are consistent with both the optical and infrared measurements. The data\nare best fit by models with a temperature inversion, as expected from the high\nincident flux. The models predict a low optical albedo of ~< 0.13, with\nsubsolar abundances of Na, K, TiO and VO. We also find that the best fitting\nmodels predict that 10% of the absorbed stellar flux is redistributed to the\nnight side of the planet, which is qualitatively consistent with the\ninefficient day-night redistribution apparent in the Kepler phase curve. Models\nwithout thermal inversions fit the data only at the 1.25 sigma level, and also\nrequire an overabundance of methane, which is not expected in the very hot\natmosphere of HAT-P-7b. We also analyze the eight transits of HAT-P-7b present\nin the EPOXI dataset and improve the constraints on the system parameters,\nfinding a period of P = 2.2047308+/-0.0000025 days, a stellar radius of R* =\n1.824+/-0.089Rsun, a planetary radius of Rp = 1.342+/-0.068RJup and an\ninclination of i = 85.7+3.5-2.2 deg.",

In this case, CoRoT-7 b is a\n\"super-Io\" that, like Jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and\nrapid resurfacing.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Explorers have made breakthroughs in many fields of astrophysics. The science\nfrom both these missions contributed to three Nobel Prizes - Giacconi (2002),\nMather, and Smoot (2006). Explorers have: marked the definitive beginning of\nprecision cosmology, discovered that short gamma-ray bursts are caused by\ncompact star mergers and have measured metalicity to redshifts z>6. NASA\nExplorers do cutting-edge science that cannot be done by facility-class\ninstruments. The Explorer program provides a rapid response to changing science\nand technology, to enable cutting-edge science at moderate cost. Explorers also\nenable innovation, and engage & train scientists, managers and engineers,\nadding human capital to NASA and the nation. The astrophysics Explorer launch\nrate now being achieved is 1 per 3 years, and budget projections are in the\n$150M/year range for the next five years. A newly Vigorous Explorer Program\nshould be created to: 1. Reach the long-stated goal of annual astrophysics\nlaunches; 2. Find additional launch options for Explorers and actively\nencourage cost savings in launchers and spacecraft, such as new commercial\nvehicles and innovative partnerships. 3. Mitigate risk via stronger technical\ndevelopment and sub-orbital programs, and through longer, more thorough, Phase\nA programs, potentially reducing the need for a 30% contingency; 4. Strive to\nprotect the funding for missions that have reached Phase B, to prevent\nsignificant launch slips and cancellations, with a goal of 4 to 5 years from\nPhase B to launch; 5. Review the project management procedures and requirements\nto seek cost reductions, including the risk management strategy and the review\nand reporting process; 6. Review and possibly modify the cost caps for all\nExplorer classes to optimize scientific returns per dollar. [ABRIDGED]",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Cassini Division in Saturn's rings contains a series of eight named gaps,\nthree of which contain dense ringlets. Observations of stellar occultations by\nthe Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft\nhave yielded ~40 accurate and precise measurements of the radial position of\nthe edges of all of these gaps and ringlets. These data reveal suggestive\npatterns in the shapes of many of the gap edges: the outer edges of the 5 gaps\nwithout ringlets are circular to within 1 km, while the inner edges of 6 of the\ngaps are eccentric, with apsidal precession rates consistent with those\nexpected for eccentric orbits near each edge. Intriguingly, the pattern speeds\nof these eccentric inner gap edges, together with that of the eccentric Huygens\nringlet,form a series with a characteristic spacing of 0.06 degrees/day. The\ntwo gaps with non-eccentric inner edges lie near first-order Inner Lindblad\nResonances (ILRs) with moons. One such edge is close to the 5:4 ILR with\nPrometheus. The other resonantly confined edge is the outer edge of the B ring,\nwhich lies near the 2:1 Mimas ILR. Detailed investigation of the B-ring-edge\ndata confirm the presence of an m=2 perturbation on the B-ring edge, but also\nsuggest that this pattern moves or librates relative to Mimas. The B-ring edge\nalso has an m=1 component that rotates around the planet at a rate close to the\nexpected apsidal precession rate. The pattern speeds of the eccentric edges in\nthe Cassini Division can potentially be generated from various combinations of\nthe pattern speeds of structures observed on the edge of the B ring. We\ntherefore suggest that the locations of most of the gaps in the Cassini\nDivision may be determined by resonances involving a combination of\nperturbations from Mimas and the massive edge of the B ring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Most simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to date either focus on the\ninterplanetary propagation of a giant plasma \"blob\" without paying too much\nattention to its origin and to the formation process or they focus on the\ncomplex evolution of the coronal magnetic field due to (sub-)photospheric\nmotions which result in an eruption. Here, we present global simulations of\nCMEs where coronal motions are used to produce a realistic evolution of the\ncoronal magnetic field and cause an eruption. We focus on active region 10069,\nwhich produced a number of eruptions in late August 2002, including the August\n24, 2002 CME - a fast (~2000 km/s) eruption originating from W81-, as well as a\nslower eruption on August 22, 2002 (originating from W62). Using a\nthree-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of these ejections with\nthe Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), we show how a realistic initiation\nmechanism enables us to study the deflection of the CME in the corona and in\nthe heliosphere. Reconnection of the erupting magnetic field with that of\nneighboring streamers and active regions modify the solar connectivity of the\nfield lines connecting to Earth and change the expected solar energetic\nparticle fluxes. Comparing the results at 1 AU of our simulations with in situ\nobservations by the ACE spacecraft, we propose an alternate solar origin for\nthe shock wave observed at L1 on August 26.",

We have estimated the composition\nof these lakes by using the direct abundance measurements from the Gas\nChromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) aboard the Huygens probe and recent\nphotochemical models based on the vertical temperature profile derived by the\nHuygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument (HASI). Thermodynamic equilibrium is\nassumed between the atmosphere and the lakes, which are also considered as\nnonideal solutions. We find that the main constituents of the lakes are ethane\n(C2H6) (~76-79%), propane (C3H8) (~7-8%), methane (CH4) (~5-10%), hydrogen\ncyanide (HCN) (~2-3%), butene (C4H8) (~1%), butane (C4H10) (~1%) and acetylene\n(C2H2) (~1%). The calculated composition of lakes is then substantially\ndifferent from what has been expected from models elaborated prior to the\nexploration of Titan by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Formation-flying studies to date have required continuous and minute\ncorrections of the orbital elements and attitudes of the spacecraft.This\nincreases the complexity, and associated risk, of controlling the formation,\nwhich often makes formation-flying studies infeasible for technological and\neconomic reasons. Passive formation-flying is a novel space-flight concept,\nwhich offers a remedy to those problems. Spacecraft in a passive formation are\nallowed to drift and rotate slowly, but by using advanced metrology and\nstatistical modelling methods, their relative positions, velocities, and\norientations are determined with very high accuracy. The metrology data is used\ndirectly by the payloads to compensate for spacecraft motions in software. The\nnormally very stringent spacecraft control requirements are thereby relaxed,\nwhich significantly reduces mission complexity and cost. Space-borne\nlow-frequency radio astronomy has been identified as a key science application\nfor a conceptual pathfinder mission using this novel approach. The mission,\ncalled FIRST (Formation-flying sub-Ionospheric Radio astronomy Science and\nTechnology) Explorer, is currently under study by the European Space Agency\n(ESA). Its objective is to demonstrate passive formation-flying and at the same\ntime perform unique world class science with a very high serendipity factor, by\nopening a new frequency window to astronomy.",
