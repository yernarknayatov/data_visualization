    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present an analysis of the first Kepler K2 mission observations of a\nrapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star, HD 24355 ($V=9.65$). The star was\ndiscovered in SuperWASP broadband photometry with a frequency of 224.31\nd$^{-1}$, (2596.18 $\\mu$Hz; $P = 6.4$ min) and an amplitude of 1.51 mmag, with\nlater spectroscopic analysis of low-resolution spectra showing HD 24355 to be\nan A5 Vp SrEu star. The high precision K2 data allow us to identify 13\nrotationally split sidelobes to the main pulsation frequency of HD 24355. This\nnumber of sidelobes combined with an unusual rotational phase variation show\nthis star to be the most distorted quadrupole roAp pulsator yet observed. In\nmodelling this star, we are able to reproduce well the amplitude modulation of\nthe pulsation, and find a close match to the unusual phase variations. We show\nthis star to have a pulsation frequency higher than the critical cut-off\nfrequency. This is currently the only roAp star observed with the Kepler\nspacecraft in Short Cadence mode that has a photometric amplitude detectable\nfrom the ground, thus allowing comparison between the mmag amplitude\nground-based targets and the $\\mu$mag spaced-based discoveries. No further\npulsation modes are identified in the K2 data, showing this star to be a\nsingle-mode pulsator.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We analyze an event in front of the bow shock observed by Cluster spacecraft\non 22.02.2006. This event has many attributes of Hot Flow Anomaly at early\nstage of development including strong upstream beam and disturbed magnetic\nprofile with increased magnetic field at one or two sides as observed by 4\nCluster spacecraft. The angle between the magnetic field vectors at two sides\nof the current sheet was ~ 10\u00b0. The minimum magnetic field magnitude\nwithin HFA was ~ 1 nT. The shock at two sides of the HFA was\nquasi-perpendicular. Upstream beam was observed on the leading side of the HFA.\nParameters and velocity distributions of solar wind ions and of upstream ions\nobserved on C1 and C3 spacecraft are analyzed separately in order to trace\ntheir changes across the event. The goal of this analysis was to get more\ninformation about the source of upstream beam. The beam evolved from the start\nof its observation till the HFA encounter being initially energetic and nearly\nmono-energetic. Its mean energy continuously decreased and energy spectrum\nwidened as HFA approached spacecraft. First observation of particular energy\nthat diminished with approaching the HFA varied linearly with gyro-radius of\nions. The energy spectra of integrated beam (for all observation) and the\nenergy spectrum of the beam observed just in front of HFA are very similar to\nthe magnetosheath ion energy spectrum observed after bow shock crossing at ~ 1\nhour after observation of the HFA. Lowest energies in the beam were observed\nwithin HFA only. Highest density and pressure of upstream beam are found in the\ncurrent sheet itself. We suggest that the upstream beam is the result of the\nmagnetosheath ions leakage through the region of HFA crossing with the bow\nshock front.",

These characterizations are pivotal\nfor endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar twins,\nunderstanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and tracing the\ndynamics of our Galaxy. The volume of data that is becoming available, however,\nbrings with it the need to process this information accurately and rapidly.\nWhile existing methods can constrain fundamental stellar parameters such as\nages, masses, and radii from these observations, they require substantial\ncomputational efforts to do so.\nWe develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating\nfundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical and\nasteroseismic observations.

We\nfind that our estimates and their associated uncertainties are comparable to\nthe results of other methods, but with the additional benefit of being able to\nexplore many more stellar parameters while using much less computation time.

In addition to providing\na direct estimate of the local rate of energy transfer between fields and\nparticles, it provides vital new information about the distribution of that\nenergy transfer in velocity space. This velocity-space signature can\npotentially be used to identify the dominant collisionless mechanism\nresponsible for the damping of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind. The\napplication of this novel field-particle correlation technique is illustrated\nusing the simplified case of the Landau damping of Langmuir waves in an\nelectrostatic 1D-1V Vlasov-Poisson plasma, showing that the procedure both\nestimates the local rate of energy transfer from the electrostatic field to the\nelectrons and indicates the resonant nature of this interaction. Modifications\nof the technique to enable single-point spacecraft measurements of fields and\nparticles to diagnose the collisionless damping of turbulent fluctuations in\nthe solar wind are discussed, yielding a method with the potential to transform\nour ability to maximize the scientific return from current and upcoming\nspacecraft missions, such as the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and Solar\nProbe Plus missions.",

The extreme solar storm,\nwith a superfast shock and extremely enhanced ejecta magnetic fields observed\nnear 1 AU at STEREO A, was caused by the combination of successive coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). Meanwhile, energetic particles were observed by STEREO and\nnear-Earth spacecraft such as ACE and SOHO, suggestive of a wide longitudinal\nspread of the particles at 1 AU. Combining the SEP observations with in situ\nplasma and magnetic field measurements we investigate the longitudinal\ndistribution of the SEP event in connection with the associated shock and CMEs.\nOur results underscore the complex magnetic configuration of the inner\nheliosphere formed by solar eruptions.

Short-cadence (58.8 s) photometric data using a\ncustom aperture were obtained during Quarter 6 (June-September 2010) and\nsubsequently in Quarters 8 and 12-17. We present analyses of the solar-like\noscillations based on Q6 and Q8 data, identifying angular degree $l$ = 0, 1,\nand 2 oscillations in the range 1000-2700 microHz, with a large frequency\nseparation of 83.9 plus/minus 0.4 microHz, and frequency with maximum amplitude\n1829 plus/minus 54 microHz. We also present analyses of new ground-based\nspectroscopic observations, which, when combined with angular diameter\nmeasurements from interferometry and Hipparcos parallax, give T_eff = 6697\nplus/minus 78 K, radius 1.49 plus/minus 0.03 solar radii, [Fe/H] = -0.02\nplus/minus 0.06 dex, and log g = 4.23 plus/minus 0.03. We calculate stellar\nmodels matching the constraints using several methods, including using the Yale\nRotating Evolution Code and the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal. The best-fit\nmodels have masses 1.35-1.39 solar masses and ages 1.0-1.6 Gyr. theta Cyg's\nT_eff and log g place it cooler than the red edge of the gamma Doradus\ninstability region established from pre-Kepler ground-based observations, but\njust at the red edge derived from pulsation modeling. The pulsation models show\ngamma Dor gravity-mode pulsations driven by the convective-blocking mechanism,\nwith frequencies of 1 to 3 cycles/day (11 to 33 microHz). However, gravity\nmodes were not detected in the Kepler data, one signal at 1.776 cycles/day\n(20.56 microHz) may be attributable to a faint, possibly background, binary.\nAsteroseismic studies of theta Cyg and other A-F stars observed by Kepler and\nCoRoT, will help to improve stellar model physics and to test pulsation driving\nmechanisms.",

Previously, the Kepler Spacecraft only observed two\ntransits of Kepler-421b leaving the planet's transit ephemeris unconstrained.\nOur visible light, time-series observations from the 4.3-meter Discovery\nChannel Telescope were designed to capture pre-transit baseline and the partial\ntransit of Kepler-421b barring significant TTVs. We use the light curves to\nassess the probabilities of various transit models using both the posterior\nodds ratio and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and find that a transit\nmodel with no TTVs is favored to 3.6-sigma confidence. These observations\nsuggest that Kepler-421b is either alone in its system or is only experiencing\nminor dynamic interactions with an unseen companion. With the Kepler-421b\nephemeris constrained, we calculate future transit times and discuss the\nopportunity to characterize the atmosphere of this cold, long-period exoplanet\nvia transmission spectroscopy.

The Medium\nEnergy Proton and Electron Detectors (MEPED) instrument on board the NOAA/Polar\nOrbiting Environmental Satellites(POES) and MetOp spacecraft has two sets of\nelectron and proton telescopes pointing close to zenith ($0 ^{\\circ}$) and in\nthe horizontal plane ($90 ^{\\circ}$). Using measurements from either the $0\n^{\\circ}$ or $90 ^{\\circ}$ telescope will underestimate or overestimate the\nbounce loss cone flux, respectively, as the energetic electron fluxes are often\nstrongly anisotropic with decreasing fluxes toward the center of the loss cone.\nBy combining the measurements from both telescopes with electron pitch angle\ndistributions from theory of wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, a\ncomplete bounce loss cone flux is constructed for each of the electron energy\nchannels >50 keV, >100 keV, and >300 keV. We apply a correction method to\nremove proton contamination in the electron counts. We also account for the\nrelativistic (>1000 keV) electrons contaminating the proton detector at\nsubauroral latitudes. This gives us full range coverage of electron energies\nthat will be deposited in the middle atmosphere. Finally, we demonstrate the\nmethod's applicability on strongly anisotropic pitch angle distributions during\na weak geomagnetic storm in February 2008. We compare the electron fluxes and\nsubsequent energy deposition estimates to OH observations from the Microwave\nLimb Sounder on the Aura satellite substantiating that the estimated fluxes are\nrepresentative for the true precipitating fluxes impacting the atmosphere.",

The triangulation of the SWAVES source directions\nposited the ecliptic projections of the radio sources near the line connecting\nthe Sun and the STEREO-A spacecraft.

The WAVES source directions close to 1 MHz frequencies\nmatched the location of the leading edge of the primary CME seen in the images\nof the LASCO/C3 coronagraph. This correspondence of spatial locations at both\nwavelengths confirms that the CME-CME interaction region is the source of the\ntype II enhancement.

Motivated by these observations, we have developed an evolutionary\nglacial flow model of solid nitrogen ice taking into account its published\nthermophysical and rheologies properties. This model assumes that glacial ice\nlayers flow laminarly and have low aspect ratios which permits a vertically\nintegrated mathematical formulation. We assess the conditions for the validity\nof laminar nitrogen ice motion by revisiting the problem of the onset of\nsolid-state buoyant convection of nitrogen ice for a variety of bottom thermal\nboundary conditions. Subject to uncertainties in nitrogen ice rheology,\nnitrogen ice layers are estimated to flow laminarly for thicknesses less than\n400-1000 meters. The resulting mass-flux formulation for when the nitrogen ice\nflows as a laminar dry glacier is characterized by an Arrhenius-Glen functional\nform. The flow model developed is used here to qualitatively answer some\nquestions motivated by observed glacial flow features found on Sputnik Planum.\nWe find that the wavy transverse dark features found along the northern\nshoreline of Sputnik Planum may be a transitory imprint of shallow topography\njust beneath the ice surface suggesting the possibility that a major shoreward\nflow event happened relatively recently within the last few hundred years.\nModel results also support the interpretation that the prominent darkened\nfeatures resembling flow lobes observed along the eastern shoreline of the\nSputnik Planum basin may be a result of wet nitrogen glacial ice flowing into\nthe basin from the pitted highlands of eastern Tombaugh Regio.",

We validate this technique with the help of artificial\nhelioseismic data. The analysed data set was obtained by numerically simulating\nthe effect of the meridional flow on the seismic wave field in the full volume\nof the Sun. In this way, a 51.2-hour long time series was generated. The\nresulting surface velocity field is then analyzed in various settings: Two\n$360^\\circ \\times 90^\\circ$ halfspheres, two $120^\\circ \\times 60^\\circ$\npatches on the front and farside of the Sun (North and South, respectively) and\ntwo $120^\\circ \\times 60^\\circ$ patches on the northern and southern frontside\nonly. We compare two possible measurement setups: observations from Earth and\nfrom an additional spacecraft on the solar farside, and observations from Earth\nonly, in which case the full information of the global solar oscillation wave\nfield was available. We find that, with decreasing observing area, the\naccessible depth range decreases: the $360^\\circ \\times 90^\\circ$ view allows\nus to probe the meridional flow almost to the bottom of the convection zone,\nwhile the $120^\\circ \\times 60^\\circ$ view means only the outer layers can be\nprobed. These results confirm the validity of the Fourier-Legendre analysis\ntechnique for helioseismology of the meridional flow. Furthermore these flows\nare of special interest for missions like Solar Orbiter that promises to\ncomplement standard helioseismic measurements from the solar nearside with\nfarside observations.",

The mission consisted of three spacecraft flying\nin elliptical orbits, from 27 March to 27 June 2006. Reprocessing includes (1)\ntransforming the data into the Modified Apex Coordinate System for projection\nto a common reference altitude of 110km, (2) correcting gain jumps, and (3)\nvalidating the results. We display the averaged magnetic perturbations as a\nkeogram, which allows direct comparison of the full-mission data with the solar\nwind values and geomagnetic indices.With the data referenced to a common\naltitude, we find the following: (1) Magnetic perturbations that track the\npassage of corotating interaction regions and high-speed solar wind; (2)\nunexpectedly strong dayside perturbations during a solstice magnetospheric\nsawtooth oscillation interval characterized by a radial interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) component that may have enhanced the accompanying modest southward\nIMF; and (3) intervals of reduced magnetic perturbations or \"calms,\" associated\nwith periods of slow solar wind, interspersed among variable-length episodic\nenhancements. These calms aremost evidentwhen the IMF is northward or\nprojectswith a northward component onto the geomagnetic dipole. The reprocessed\nST5 data are in very good agreement with magnetic perturbations from the\nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft, which we also map\nto 110km. We briefly discuss the methods used to remap the ST5 data and the\nmeans of validating the results against DMSP. Our methods form the basis for\nfuture intermission comparisons of space-based magnetometer data.",

HMI collects sequences of polarized\nfiltergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 x 4096 cameras from which\nare computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables: the\nline-of-sight (LoS) velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line\nwidth, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters, I Q U V, at 6\nwavelengths. Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science\nOperations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from\ncalibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the\nother, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s\ncadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD\ncharacteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization\nirregularities, filter-element uncertainty and non-uniformity, as well as\nSun-spacecraft velocity. This report explains issues affecting the resulting\nphysical quantities, describes the impact of regular updates to the instrument\ncalibration, and shows how the computations are optimized for actual HMI\nobservations. During the 5 years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration\nsequences have been used to regularly improve and update the instrument\ncalibration and to monitor instrument changes. The instrument more than\nsatisfies the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The\nprocedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most\nsignificant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft\norbital velocity.",

The spacecraft will also come close to a\nnumber of Mercury-crossing asteroids with perihelia less than 0.3 AU. At small\nheliocentric distances, these objects may begin to lose mass, thus becoming\n\"active asteroids\" with comet-like comae or tails. This paper assembles a\ndatabase of 97 known Mercury-crossing asteroids that may be encountered by SPP,\nand it presents estimates of their time-dependent visible-light fluxes and mass\nloss rates. Assuming a similar efficiency of sky background subtraction as was\nachieved by STEREO, we find that approximately 80% of these asteroids are\nbright enough to be observed by the Wide-field Imager for SPP (WISPR). A model\nof gas/dust mass loss from these asteroids is developed and calibrated against\nexisting observations. This model is used to estimate the visible-light fluxes\nand spatial extents of spherical comae. Observable dust clouds occur only when\nthe asteroids approach the Sun closer than 0.2 AU. The model predicts that\nduring the primary SPP mission between 2018 and 2025, there should be 113\ndiscrete events (for 24 unique asteroids) during which the modeled comae have\nangular sizes resolvable by WISPR. The largest of these correspond to asteroids\n3200 Phaethon, 137924, 155140, and 289227, all with angular sizes of roughly 15\nto 30 arcminutes.

Using a\ncombination of single-spacecraft and multispacecraft techniques, we calculated\nmacroscopic features such as thickness, location, and motion of the\nmagnetopause.

Solar wind conditions and the\ninterplanetary magnetic field cannot fully explain the observed dawn-dusk\nasymmetry. For a number of crossings we were also able to derive detailed\ncurrent density profiles. The profiles show that the magnetopause often\nconsists of two or more adjacent current sheets, each current sheet typically\nseveral ion gyroradii thick and often with different current direction.

The similar\ncollisionless plasma shocks frequently encountered by spacecraft in the solar\nwind are generally far weaker (lower Mach number) than these SNR shocks.\nHowever, the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the shock standing in the solar\nwind sunward of Saturn (Saturn's bow shock) can occasionally reach this\nhigh-Mach number astrophysical regime. In this regime Cassini has provided the\nfirst in situ evidence for electron acceleration under quasi-parallel upstream\nmagnetic conditions. Here we present the full picture of suprathermal electrons\nat Saturn's bow shock revealed by Cassini. The downstream thermal electron\ndistribution is resolved in all data taken by the low-energy electron detector\n(CAPS-ELS, <28 keV) during shock crossings, but the higher energy channels were\nat (or close to) background. The high-energy electron detector (MIMI-LEMMS, >18\nkeV) measured a suprathermal electron signature at 31 of 508 crossings, where\ntypically only the lowest energy channels (<100 keV) were above background. We\nshow that these results are consistent with theory in which the \"injection\" of\nthermal electrons into an acceleration process involves interaction with\nwhistler waves at the shock front, and becomes possible for all upstream\nmagnetic field orientations at high Mach numbers like those of the strong\nshocks around young SNRs. A future dedicated study will analyze the rare\ncrossings with evidence for relativistic electrons (up to ~1 MeV).",

Observations show sustained (though\ntidally modulated) fissure eruptions throughout each orbit, and since the 2005\ndiscovery of the plumes. Peak plume flux lags peak tidal extension by $\\sim$1\nradian, suggestive of resonance. Here we show that a model of the tiger stripes\nas tidally-flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain\nthe persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and\nthe total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that the\neruptions are maintained over geological timescales. The delay associated with\nflushing and refilling of \\emph{O}(1) m-wide slots with ocean water causes\nerupted flux to lag tidal forcing and helps to buttress slots against closure,\nwhile tidally pumped in-slot flow leads to heating and mechanical disruption\nthat staves off slot freeze-out. Much narrower and much wider slots cannot be\nsustained. In the presence of long-lived slots, the 10$^6$-yr average power\noutput of the tiger stripes is buffered by a feedback between ice melt-back and\nsubsidence to \\emph{O}(10$^{10}$) W, which is similar to the observed power\noutput, suggesting long-term stability. Turbulent dissipation makes testable\npredictions for the final flybys of Enceladus by the \\emph{Cassini} spacecraft.\nOur model shows how open connections to an ocean can be reconciled with, and\nsustain, long-lived eruptions. Turbulent dissipation in long-lived slots helps\nmaintain the ocean against freezing, maintains access by future Enceladus\nmissions to ocean materials, and is plausibly the major energy source for tiger\nstripe activity.",

Measuring cold ions is difficult though.\nObservations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in\nregions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar\nillumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle\ndetectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow\nduring segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise if continuous\nlongtime observations, such as during a geomagnetic storm, are needed. In this\npaper we suggest a new approach, based on a combination of synoptic\nobservations and a novel technique to estimate the flux and total outflow\nduring the various phases of geomagnetic storms. Our results indicate large\nvariations in both outflow rates and transport throughout the storm. Prior to\nthe storm main phase, outflow rates are moderate, and the cold ions are mainly\nemanating from moderately sized polar cap regions. Throughout the main phase of\nthe storm, outflow rates increase and the polar cap source regions expand.\nFurthermore, faster transport, resulting from enhanced convection, leads to a\nmuch larger supply of cold ions to the near-Earth region during geomagnetic\nstorms.",

The overtaken solar wind forms a sheath of\ncompressed plasma at the front of ICMEs. Magnetic clouds (MCs) are a subset of\nICMEs with specific properties (e.g. the presence of a flux rope). When ICMEs\npass near Earth, ground observations indicate that the flux of galactic cosmic\nrays (GCRs) decreases. The main aims of this paper are to find: common plasma\nand magnetic properties of different ICME sub-structures, and which ICME\nproperties affect the flux of GCRs near Earth. We use a superposed epoch method\napplied to a large set of ICMEs observed \\insitu\\ by the spacecraft ACE,\nbetween 1998 and 2006. We also apply a superposed epoch analysis on GCRs time\nseries observed with the McMurdo neutron monitors. We find that slow MCs at 1\nAU have on average more massive sheaths. We conclude that it is because they\nare more effectively slowed down by drag during their travel from the Sun. Slow\nMCs also have a more symmetric magnetic field and sheaths expanding similarly\nas their following MC, while in contrast, fast MCs have an asymmetric magnetic\nprofile and a compressing sheath in compression. In all types of MCs, we find\nthat the proton density and the temperature, as well as the magnetic\nfluctuations can diffuse within the front of the MC due to 3D reconnection.\nFinally, we derive a quantitative model which describes the decrease of cosmic\nrays as a function of the amount of magnetic fluctuations and field strength.\nThe obtained typical profiles of sheath/MC/GCR properties corresponding to\nslow, mid, and fast ICMEs, can be used for forecasting/modelling these events,\nand to better understand the transport of energetic particles in ICMEs.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  BepiColombo is a joint ESA/JAXA mission to Mercury with challenging\nobjectives regarding geophysics, geodesy and fundamental physics. The Mercury\nOrbiter Radioscience Experiment (MORE) is one of the on-board experiments,\nincluding three different but linked experiments: gravimetry, rotation and\nrelativity. The aim of the relativity experiment is the measurement of the\npost-Newtonian parameters. Thanks to accurate tracking between Earth and\nspacecraft, the results are expected to be very precise. However, the outcomes\nof the experiment strictly depends on our \"knowledge\" about solar system:\nephemerides, number of bodies (planets, satellites and asteroids) and their\nmasses. In this paper we describe a semi-analytic model used to perform a\ncovariance analysis to quantify the effects, on the relativity experiment, due\nto the uncertainties of solar system bodies parameters. In particular, our\nattention is focused on the Nordtvedt parameter $\\eta$ used to parametrize the\nstrong equivalence principle violation. After our analysis we estimated\n$\\sigma[\\eta]\\lessapprox 4.5\\times 10^{-5}$ which is about 1~order of magnitude\nlarger than the \"ideal\" case where masses of planets and asteroids have no\nerrors. The current value, obtained from ground based experiments and lunar\nlaser ranging measurements, is $\\sigma[\\eta]\\approx 4.4\\times 10^{-4}$.\nTherefore, we conclude that, even in presence of uncertainties on solar system\nparameters, the measurement of $\\eta$ by MORE can improve the current precision\nof about 1~order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and Nitrogen containing\nPAH (PANH) as intermediates of aerosol production in the atmosphere of Titan\nhas been a subject of controversy for a long time. An analysis of the\natmospheric emission band observed by the Visible and Infrared Mapping\nSpectrometer (VIMS) at 3.28 micrometer suggests the presence of neutral\npolycyclic aromatic species in the upper atmosphere of Titan. These molecules\nare seen as the counter part of negative and positive aromatics ions suspected\nby the Plasma Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft, but the low\nresolution of the instrument hinders any molecular speciation.\nIn this work we investigate the specific aromatic content of Titan's\natmospheric aerosols through laboratory simulations. We report here the\nselective detection of aromatic compounds in tholins, Titan's aerosol\nanalogues, produced with a capacitively coupled plasma in a N2:CH4 95:5 gas\nmixture. For this purpose, Two-Step Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight\nMass Spectrometry (L2DI-TOF-MS) technique is used to analyze the so produced\nanalogues. This analytical technique is based on the ionization of molecules by\nResonance Enhanced Multi-Photon Ionization (REMPI) using a {\\lambda}=248 nm\nwavelength laser which is selective for aromatic species. This allows for the\nselective identification of compounds having at least one aromatic ring. Our\nexperiments show that tholins contain a trace amount of small PAHs with one to\nthree aromatic rings. Nitrogen containing PAHs (PANHs) are also detected as\nconstituents of tholins. Molecules relevant to astrobiology are detected as is\nthe case of the substituted DNA base adenine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A Drag-Free CubeSat mission has been proposed to demonstrate the feasibility\nof a Gravitational Reference Sensor (GRS) with an optical readout for a 3 units\n(3U) spacecraft. A purely drag-free object is defined by the absence of all\nexternal forces other than gravity, which are shielded by the spacecraft. In a\nreal case, the TM will still be affected by disturbances. Several of them are\npassively reduced by the design of the TM housing. This system is a\nthick-walled aluminium box that holds the shadow sensors and shields the TM.\nThe housing has an effect on the mechanical, thermal and magnetic environment\naround the TM. All of them have been analysed. The mechanical vibrations have\nto fit the launch environment and the modes have to be outside of the\nmeasurement range (0.0001 - 1 Hz). The magnetic field has to be reduced by a\n0.01 factor. The temperature difference between internal opposing surfaces,\ndetermining pressure on the TM, has to be below 10^-3(1 mHz/f)1/3 K Hz^-1/2.\nThe housing, together with the TM, the sensors and the UV LEDs for charging\ncontrol, constitutes the GRS, which would then fit into a 1U. The other 2Us are\noccupied by the caging mechanism that constraints the TM during launch, the\nthrusters, the Attitude Determination And Control System (ADACS) and the\nelectronics. The Drag-Free CubeSat will be the result of the combined efforts\nof Stanford, University of Florida, KACST and NASA and will be the first\ndrag-free mission with an optical readout and the first GRS designed within the\nlimits of a 3U small satellite. In the first section, this paper briefly\nupdates on the main characteristics and systems of the project. Particular\nemphasis is then given to the recently designed housing, its expected\nperformance and the open issues.",

During the outburst, the Fermi\nspacecraft, which has an orbital period of 95.4 min, was operated in a special\npointing mode to optimize the exposure for 3C 279. For the first time,\nsignificant flux variability at sub-orbital timescales was found in blazar\nobservations by Fermi-LAT. The source flux variability was resolved down to\n2-min binned timescales, with flux doubling times less than 5 min. The observed\nminute-scale variability suggests a very compact emission region at hundreds of\nSchwarzschild radii from the central engine in conical jet models. A minimum\nbulk jet Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma$) of 35 is necessary to avoid both internal\n$\\gamma$-ray absorption and super-Eddington jet power. In the standard\nexternal-radiation-Comptonization scenario, $\\Gamma$ should be at least 50 to\navoid overproducing the synchrotron-self-Compton component. However, this\npredicts extremely low magnetization ($\\sim5\\times10^{-4}$). Equipartition\nrequires $\\Gamma$ as high as 120, unless the emitting region is a small\nfraction of the dissipation region. Alternatively, we consider $\\gamma$ rays\noriginating as synchrotron radiation of $\\gamma_{\\rm e}\\sim1.6\\times10^6$\nelectrons, in magnetic field $B\\sim1.3$ kG, accelerated by strong electric\nfields $E\\sim B$ in the process of magnetoluminescence.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Collisionless shocks vary drastically from terrestrial to astrophysical\nregimes resulting in radically different characteristics. This poses two\ncomplexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on\nphysical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating\nobservations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span\nacross different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since\nthe majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova\nremnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by\nmeans of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow\nshock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft. We find\nthat Saturn's bow shock exhibits characteristics akin to both terrestrial and\nastrophysical regimes (MA of order 100), which is principally controlled by the\nupstream magnetic field strength. Moreover, we determined the {\\theta}Bn of\neach crossing to show that Saturn's (dayside) bow shock is predominantly\nquasi-perpendicular by virtue of the Parker spiral at 10 AU. Our results\nsuggest a strong dependence on MA in controlling the onset of physical\nmechanisms in collisionless shocks, particularly non-time stationarity and\nvariability. We anticipate our comprehensive assessment will yield deeper\ninsight into high MA collisionless shocks and provide a broader scope for\nunderstanding the structures and mechanisms of collisionless shocks.",
