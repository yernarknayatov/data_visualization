The connection\nbetween parameters of the microwave emission at three different solar\natmosphere levels and the solar wind velocity near the Earth's orbit was\ndetermined. This connection suggests existence of common mechanisms of solar\nwind acceleration from chromospheric altitudes to the upper corona.

We show that solar\nflares of small scale, those with prompt X-ray emission classified by GOES as\nC-Class (power $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ W m$^2$ at 1 AU) may give rise to muon\nexcess probably associated with solar protons and ions emitted by the flare and\narriving at the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The Tupi telescopes are\nwithin the central region of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), which allows\nparticle detectors to achieve a low rigidity of response to primary and\nsecondary charged particles ($\\geq 0.1$ GV). Here we argue for the possibility\nof a \"scale-free\" energy distribution of particles accelerated by solar flares.\nLarge and small scale flares have the same energy spectrum up to energies\nexceeding the pion production, the difference between them is only the\nintensity. If this hypothesis is correct, the Tupi telescope is registering\nmuons produced by protons (ions) whose energy corresponds to the tail of the\nspectrum. Consequently the energy distribution of the emitted protons has to be\na power law spectrum, since power law distributions are characterized as scale\nfree distributions. The Tupi events give support to this conjecture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The increasing number of extra-solar planets opens a new opportunity for\nstudies of the formation of planetary systems. Resonant systems are of\nparticular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints\non the unobservable formation and migration phase. In this thesis, formation\nscenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented. N-body\nsimulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of\nproto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture\ninto resonance. The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger\nsurface density than previously thought. Proto-planets are exposed to\nstochastic forces, generated by density fluctuations in the disc. A generic\nmodel of both a single planet, and two planets in resonance, being\nstochastically forced is presented. The system GJ876, for example, is stable\nfor reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces, but systems with lighter\nplanets can get disrupted. Even if they are not disrupted completely,\nstochastic forces create characteristic, observable libration patterns.\nTurbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet\nformation process. Due to the large separation of scales, the gravitational\ncollapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically. A\nscaled method is presented, that allows for the correct treatment of\nself-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the\nrelevant small scale processes. Interestingly, this system is dynamically very\nsimilar to Saturn's rings. The stochastic migration of small bodies in Saturn's\nrings is also studied. Analytic predictions of the interactions of a\nmoonlet/propeller with ring particles are compared to collisional N-body\nsimulations with up to a million particles. The random walk is fast enough to\nbe directly observable by the Cassini spacecraft.",

This paper reports\nresults from eight observing epochs between 2006 October and 2009 April. These\ndata are combined with two VLBA observations by other investigators in 2004 and\na Cassini-based gravitational deflection measurement by Fomalont et al. in 2009\nto constrain a new ephemeris (DE 422). The DE 422 post-fit residuals for Saturn\nwith respect to the VLBA data are generally 0.2 mas, but additional\nobservations are needed to improve the positions of all of our phase reference\nsources to this level. Over time we expect to be able to improve the accuracy\nof all three coordinates in the Saturn ephemeris (latitude, longitude, and\nrange) by a factor of at least three.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Radio tracking of interplanetary probes is an important tool for navigation\npurposes as well as for testing the laws of physics or exploring planetary\nenvironments. The addition of an accelerometer on board a spacecraft provides\norbit determination specialists and physicists with an additional observable of\ngreat interest: it measures the value of the non-gravitational acceleration\nacting on the spacecraft, i.e. the departure of the probe from geodesic motion.\nThis technology is now routinely used for geodesy missions in Earth orbits with\nelectrostatic accelerometers. This article proposes a technological evolution\nwhich consists in adding a subsystem to remove the bias of an electrostatic\naccelerometer. It aims at enhancing the scientific return of interplanetary\nmissions in the Solar System, from the point of view of fundamental physics as\nwell as Solar System physics. The main part of the instrument is an\nelectrostatic accelerometer called MicroSTAR, which inherits mature\ntechnologies based on Onera's experience in the field of accelerometry. This\naccelerometer is mounted on a rotating stage, called Bias Rejection System,\nwhich modulates the non-gravitational acceleration and thus permits to remove\nthe bias of the instrument from the signal of interest. This article presents\nthe motivations of this study, describes the instrument, called GAP, and the\nmeasurement principle, and discusses the performance of the instrument as well\nas integration constraints. Within a mass of 3.1 kg and an average consumption\nof 3 W, it is possible to reach a precision of 1 pm s$^{-2}$ for the\nacceleration measured with an integration time of five hours. Combining this\nobservable with the radio tracking data, it is therefore possible to compare\nthe motion of the spacecraft to theoretical predictions with a precision\nimproved by at least three orders of magnitude with respect to existing\ntechniques.",

The 'edge' of the interstellar cloud\npresently surrounding the heliosphere extends less than 0.1 pc in the upwind\ndirection, terminating at an unknown distance, indicating that the outer\nboundary conditions of the heliosphere could change during the lifetime of the\nIBEX satellite. Using reasonable values for future outer heliosphere boundary\nconditions, ENA fluxes are predicted for one possible source of ENAs coming\nfrom outside of the heliopause. The ENA production simulations use\nthree-dimensional MHD plasma models of the heliosphere that include a kinetic\ndescription of neutrals and a Lorentzian distribution for ions. Based on this\nENA production model, it is then shown that the sensitivities of the IBEX 1.1\nkeV skymaps are sufficient to detect the variations in ENA fluxes that are\nexpected to accompany the solar transition into the next upwind cloud.\nApproximately 20% of the IBEX 1.1 keV pixels appear capable of detecting the\npredicted model differences at the $ 3 \\sigma$ level, with these pixels\nconcentrated in the Ribbon region. Regardless of the detailed ENA production\nmodel, the success of the modeled \\BdotR\\ directions in reproducing the Ribbon\nlocus, together with our results, indicate that the Ribbon phenomenon traces\nthe variations in the heliosphere distortion caused by the relative pressures\nof the interstellar magnetic and gaseous components.",

A flat spectrum is observed at the peak of the particle\nevent and the spectrum becomes steeper as the CME moves farther out into the\ninner heliosphere. However, the magnitude of change in spectral slopes differs\nfrom one CME to the other, suggesting the difference in energy available within\nthe CME to drive the shock. The spectral index evolution as a function of\ninitial speed of the CME at different parts of the particle profile has also\nbeen compared. The result shows that the change in particle flux with time is\nrather quick for the high-energy portion of the spectrum than that of the\nlow-energy part, which makes the steepening of the energy spectrum with\ntime/distance from the Sun.

A pair of nonlinear equations that describe the interaction of UH\nwave envelopes (including the relativistic electron mass increase) and the\ndensity as well as the compressional magnetic field perturbations associated\nwith the AWs is solved numerically to show that many coherent solitary patterns\ncan be excited and saturated due to modulational instability of unstable UH\nwaves. The evolution of these solitary patterns is also shown to appear in the\nstates of spatiotemporal coherence, temporal as well as spatiotemporal chaos\ndue to collision and fusion among the patterns in stochastic motion.\nFurthermore, these spatiotemporal features are demonstrated by the analysis of\nwavelet power spectra. It is found that a redistribution of wave energy takes\nplace to higher harmonic modes with small wavelengths which, in turn, results\ninto the onset of Alfvenic turbulence in dusty magnetoplasmas. Such a scenario\ncan occur in the vicinity of Saturn's magnetosphere as many electrostatic\nsolitary structures have been observed there by the Cassini spacecraft.",

IKAROS has a huge sail with 20 m in diameter which is\nmade of thin polyimide membrane. This sail converts the solar\nradiation-pressure into the propulsion force of IKAROS and accelerates the\nspacecraft. The Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) aboard IKAROS is the first\npolarimeter to observe the gamma-ray polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nduring the IKAROS cruising phase. GAP is a tinny detector of 3.8 kg in weight\nand 17 cm in size with an energy range between 50-300 keV. The GAP detector\nalso plays a role of the interplanetary network (IPN) to determine the GRB\ndirection. The detection principle of gamma-ray polarization is the anisotropy\nof the Compton scattering. GAP works as the GRB polarimeter with the full\ncoincidence mode between the central plastic and the surrounding CsI detectors.\nGAP is the first instrument, devoted for the observation of gamma-ray\npolarization in the astronomical history. In this paper, we present the GAP\ndetector and its ground and onboard calibrations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Using data from the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO, it is possible\nto derive the direction of propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in\naddition to their speed with a variety of methods. For CMEs observed by both\nSTEREO spacecraft, it is possible to derive their direction using simultaneous\nobservations from the twin spacecraft and also, using observations from only\none spacecraft with fitting methods. This makes it possible to test and compare\ndifferent analyses techniques. In this article, we propose a new fitting method\nbased on observations from one spacecraft, which we compare to the commonly\nused fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999). We also compare the results from\nthese two fitting methods with those from two stereoscopic methods, focusing on\n12 CMEs observed simultaneously by the two STEREO spacecraft in 2008 and 2009.\nWe find evidence that the fitting method of Sheeley et al. (1999) can result in\nsignificant errors in the determination of the CME direction when the CME\npropagates outside of 60deg \\pm 20 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line. We expect\nour new fitting method to be better adapted to the analysis of halo or limb\nCMEs with respect to the observing spacecraft. We also find some evidence that\ndirect triangulation in the HI fields-of-view should only be applied to CMEs\npropagating approximatively towards Earth (\\pm 20deg from the Sun-Earth line).\nLast, we address one of the possible sources of errors of fitting methods: the\nassumption of radial propagation. Using stereoscopic methods, we find that at\nleast seven of the 12 studied CMEs had an heliospheric deflection of less than\n20deg as they propagated in the HI fields-of-view, which, we believe, validates\nthis approximation.",

Our measurements indicate that the axisymmetric flows vary\nsystematically over the solar cycle. The differential rotation is weaker at\nmaximum than at minimum. The meridional flow is faster at minimum and slower at\nmaximum. The meridional flow speed on the approach to the Cycle 23/24 minimum\nwas substantially faster than it was at the Cycle 22/23 minimum. The average\nlatitudinal profile is largely a simple sinusoid that extends to the poles and\npeaks at about $35\\degr$ latitude. As the cycle progresses a pattern of\nin-flows toward the sunspot zones develops and moves equatorward in step with\nthe sunspot zones. These in-flows are accompanied by the torsional\noscillations. This association is consistent with the effects of the Coriolis\nforce acting on the in-flows. The equatorward motions associated with these\nin-flows are identified as the source of the decrease in net poleward flow at\ncycle maxima.

Accurate quantitative estimates of the effects of\nnuclear reactions are necessary, for example, for dose estimation and\nprediction of single-event-upset rates. To this end, it is necessary to\nconstruct predictive models for nuclear reactions, which usually consist of an\nintranuclear-cascade or quantum-molecular-dynamics stage, followed by a\nnuclear-de-excitation stage.\nWhile it is generally acknowledged that it is necessary to accurately\nsimulate the first reaction stage, transport-code users often neglect or\nunderestimate the importance of the choice of the de-excitation code. The\npurpose of this work is to prove that the de-excitation model is in fact a\nnon-negligible source of uncertainty for the prediction of several observables\nof crucial importance for space applications. For some particular observables,\nthe systematic uncertainty due to the de-excitation model actually dominates\nthe total uncertainty. Our point will be illustrated by making use of\nnucleon-nucleus calculations performed with several\nintranuclear-cascade/de-excitation models, such as the Li\u00e8ge Intranuclear\nCascade model (INCL) and Isabel (for the cascade part) and ABLA07, Dresner,\nGEM, GEMINI++ and SMM (on the de-excitation side).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Ray-like features observed by coronagraphs in the wake of Coronal Mass\nEjections (CMEs) are sometimes interpreted as the white light counterparts of\ncurrent sheets (CSs) produced by the eruption. The 3D geometry of these\nray-like features is largely unknown and its knowledge should clarify their\nassociation to the CS and place constraints on CME physics and coronal\nconditions. With this study we test these important implications for the first\ntime. An example of such a post-CME ray was observed by various coronagraphs,\nincluding these of the SECCHI instrument suite of the STEREO twin spacecraft\nand the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph LASCO onboard the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME\nwhich occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by\nabout degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third\n\"eye\" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of\nthe ray and of the CME. We applied 3D forward geometrical modeling to the CME\nand to the ray as simultaneously viewed by SECCHI-A and B and by SECCHI-A and\nLASCO, respectively. We found that the ray can be approximated by a rectangular\nslab, nearly aligned with the CME axis, and much smaller than the CME in both\nterms of thickness and depth (~ 0.05 and 0.15 Rsun respectively). We found that\nthe ray and CME are significantly displaced from the associated post-CME\nflaring loops. The properties and location of the ray are fully consistent with\nthe expectations of the standard CME theories for post-CME current sheets.\nTherefore, our multi-viewpoint observations supply strong evidence that the\nobserved post-CME ray is indeed related to a post-CME current sheet.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The asteroid (3200) Phaethon is widely recognized as the parent of the\nGeminid meteoroid stream. However, it has never shown evidence for on-going\nmass loss or for any form of comet-like activity that would indicate the\ncontinued replenishment of the stream. Following an alert by Battams and Watson\n(2009), we used NASA's STEREO-A spacecraft to image Phaethon near perihelion,\nin the period UT 2009 June 17 - 22, when the heliocentric distance was near\n0.14 AU. The resulting photometry shows an unexpected brightening, by a factor\nof two, starting UT 2009 June 20.2+/-0.2, which we interpret as an impulsive\nrelease of dust particles from Phaethon. If the density is near 2500 kg/m^3,\nthen the emitted dust particles must have a combined mass of ~2.5x10^8 a1 kg,\nwhere a1 is the particle radius in millimeters. Assuming a1 = 1, this is\napproximately 10^-4 of the Geminid stream mass and to replenish the stream in\nsteady-state within its estimated ~1000 yr lifetime would require ~10 events\nlike the one observed, per orbit. Alternatively, on-going mass loss may be\nunrelated to the event which produced the Phaethon-Geminid complex. An impact\norigin of the dust is highly unlikely. Phaethon is too hot for water ice to\nsurvive, rendering unlikely the possibility that dust is ejected through\ngas-drag from sublimated ice. Instead, we suggest that Phaethon is essentially\na rock comet, in which the small perihelion distance leads both to the\nproduction of dust (through thermal fracture and decomposition-cracking of\nhydrated minerals) and to its ejection into interplanetary space (through\nradiation pressure sweeping and other effects).",

Recently, Roukema (2010b) proves that there does exist a\ntiming-offset-induced error corresponding to about -25.6ms in the WMAP\ncalibrated TOD by studying the fluctuation variance per pixel in the\ntemperature map recovered from the TOD as a function of assumed timing-offset.\nHere, we find evidence directly in the WMAP TOD for such an uncorrected timing\nerror, possibly occurred in calculating the Doppler dipole signal during the\nWMAP team's TOD data processing. The amplitude is highly significant and is\nconsistent with previous work. We also show that the uncorrected timing-offset\ncan lead the WMAP CMB quadrupole to be substantially overestimated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Small-scale transient phenomena in the quiet Sun are believed to play an\nimportant role in coronal heating and solar wind generation. One of them named\nas \"X-ray jet\" is the subject of our study. We indent to investigate the\ndynamics, evolution and physical properties of this phenomenon. We combine\nspatially and temporally multi-instrument observations obtained simultaneously\nwith the SUMER spectrometer onboard SoHO, EIS and XRT onboard Hinode, and\nEUVI/SECCHI onboard the Ahead and Behind STEREO spacecrafts. We derive plasma\nparameters such as temperatures and densities as well as dynamics by using\nspectral lines formed in the temperature range from 10 000 K to 12 MK. We also\nuse image difference technique to investigate the evolution of the complex\nstructure of the studied phenomenon. With the available unique combination of\ndata we were able to establish that the formation of a jet-like event is\ntriggered by not one but several energy depositions which are most probably\noriginating from magnetic reconnection. Each energy deposition is followed by\nthe expulsion of pre-existing or new reconnected loops and/or collimated flow\nalong open magnetic field lines. We derived in great detail the dynamic process\nof X-ray jet formation and evolution. We also found for the first time\nspectroscopically in the quiet Sun a temperature of 12~MK and density of 4\n10^10~cm^-3 in a reconnection site. We raise an issue concerning an uncertainty\nin using the SUMER Mg X 624.9 A line for coronal diagnostics. We clearly\nidentified two types of up-flow: one collimated up-flow along open magnetic\nfield lines and a plasma cloud formed from the expelled BP loops. We also\nreport a cooler down-flow along closed magnetic field lines. A comparison is\nmade with a model developed by Moreno-Insertis \\etal\\ (2008).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  High-precision pulsar timing relies on a solar-system ephemeris in order to\nconvert times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses measured at an observatory to the\nsolar system barycenter. Any error in the conversion to the barycentric TOAs\nleads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically,\nan incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variation\nhaving a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about the\nSun. By using an array of pulsars (PSRs J0437-4715, J1744-1134, J1857+0943,\nJ1909-3744), the masses of the planetary systems from Mercury to Saturn have\nbeen determined. These masses are consistent with the best-known masses\ndetermined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the Jovian system,\n9.547921(2)E-4 Msun, being significantly more accurate than the mass determined\nfrom the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft, and consistent with but less accurate\nthan the value from the Galileo spacecraft. While spacecraft are likely to\nproduce the most accurate measurements for individual solar system bodies, the\npulsar technique is sensitive to planetary system masses and has the potential\nto provide the most accurate values of these masses for some planets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in a hot subdwarf B star\nbased on 30.5 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using the\n\\emph{Kepler} spacecraft. KIC 010139564 is found to be a short-period pulsator\nof the V361 Hya (EC 14026) class with more than 10 independent pulsation modes\nwhose periods range from 130 to 190 seconds. It also shows one periodicity at a\nperiod of 3165 seconds. If this periodicity is a high order g-mode, then this\nstar may be the hottest member of the hybrid DW Lyn stars. In addition to the\nresolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the light\ncurve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies may\nbe present. The long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle, and\nthe well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of the\nperiodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them are\nindependent stellar oscillation modes. We find that most of the identified\nperiodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotation\nperiod of 2-3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed to\nconfirm this suspicion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The mass density of dust particles that form from asteroids and comets in the\ninterplanetary medium of the solar system is, near 1 AU, comparable to the mass\ndensity of the solar wind. It is mainly contained in particles of micrometer\nsize and larger. Dust and larger objects are destroyed by collisions and\nsublimation and hence feed heavy ions into the solar wind and the solar corona.\nSmall dust particles are present in large number and as a result of their large\ncharge to mass ratio deflected by electromagnetic forces in the solar wind. For\nnano dust particles of sizes 1 - 10 nm, recent calculations show trapping near\nthe Sun and outside from about 0.15 AU ejection with velocities close to solar\nwind velocity. The fluxes of ejected nano dust are detected near 1AU with the\nplasma wave instrument onboard the STEREO spacecraft. Though such electric\nsignals have been observed during dust impacts before, the interpretation\ndepends on several different parameters and data analysis is still in progress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The largest uncollapsed inhomogeneity in the observable Universe is\nstatistically represented in the quadrupole signal of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) sky maps as observed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP). The constant temporal offset of -25.6 ms between the timestamps\nof the spacecraft attitude and observational data records in the time-ordered\ndata (TOD) of the WMAP observations was suspected to imply that previously\nderived all-sky CMB maps are erroneous, and that the quadrupole is in large\npart an artefact. The optimal focussing of bright objects in the Galactic Plane\nplays a key role in showing that no error occurred at the step of mapmaking\nfrom the calibrated TOD. Instead, the error had an effect when the uncalibrated\nTOD were calibrated. Estimates of the high-latitude quadrupole based on the\nwrongly calibrated WMAP maps are overestimated by about 15-60%.",
