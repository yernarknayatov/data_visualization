However the line profiles of\nsolar oscillations have been observed to be asymmetrical for the Sun. The\nphysical origin of this line asymmetry is not fully understood, although it\nshould depend on the depth dependence of the source of wave excitation\n(convective turbulence) and details of the observable (velocity or intensity).\nFor oscillations of the Sun, it has been shown that neglecting the asymmetry\nleads to systematic errors in the frequency determination. This could\nsubsequently affects the results of seismic inferences of the solar internal\nstructure. Using light curves from the {\\it Kepler} spacecraft we have measured\nmode asymmetries in 43 stars. We confirm that neglecting the asymmetry leads to\nsystematic errors that can exceed the $1\\sigma$ confidence intervals for\nseismic observations longer than one year. Therefore, the application of an\nasymmetric Lorentzian profile is to be favoured to improve the accuracy of the\ninternal stellar structure and stellar fundamental parameters. We also show\nthat the asymmetry changes sign between cool Sun-like stars and hotter stars.\nThis provides the best constraints to date on the location of the excitation\nsources across the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram.",

SEPs, even those accelerated during\nimpulsive events, show a much wider than expected longitudinal extent, bringing\ninto question the processes responsible for their transport perpendicular to\nthe local magnetic field. In this paper we examine some aspects of\nperpendicular transport by including perpendicular diffusion into a numerical\nSEP transport model that simulates the propagation of impulsively accelerated\nSEP electrons in the ecliptic plane. We find that: (i) The pitch-angle\ndependence of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is an important, and\ncurrently mainly overlooked, transport parameter. (ii) SEP intensities are\ngenerally asymmetric in longitude, being enhanced towards the west of optimal\nmagnetic connection to the acceleration region. (iii) The maximum SEP intensity\nmay also be shifted (parameter dependently) away from the longitude of best\nmagnetic connectivity at 1 AU. We also calculate the maximum intensity, the\ntime of maximum intensity, the onset time and the maximum anisotropy as a\nfunction of longitude at Earth's orbit and compare the results, in a\nqualitative fashion, to recent spacecraft observations.",

To account for the\npresence of this species in comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, it has been shown\nthat the radiolysis of ice grains precursors of comets is a viable mechanism in\nlow-density environments, such as molecular clouds. Here, we investigate the\nalternative possibility that the icy grains present in the midplane of the\nprotosolar nebula were irradiated during their vertical transport between the\nmidplane and the upper layers over a large number of cycles, as a result of\nturbulent mixing. Consequently, these grains spent a non-negligible fraction of\ntheir lifetime in the disk's upper regions, where the irradiation by cosmic\nrays was strong. To do so, we used a coupled disk-transport-irradiation model\nto calculate the time evolution of the molecular oxygen abundance\nradiolytically produced in ice grains. Our computations show that, even if a\nsignificant fraction of the icy particles have followed a back and forth cycle\ntowards the upper layers of the disk over 10 million of years, a timespan far\nexceeding the formation timescale of comet 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, the\namount of produced molecular oxygen is at least two orders of magnitude lower\nthan the Rosetta observations.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of geomagnetic\ndisturbances, but the effects of their interaction with Earth's magnetic field\ndepend on their magnetic configuration and orientation. Fitting and\nreconstruction techniques have been developed to determine the important\ngeometrical and physical CME properties. In many instances, there is\ndisagreement between such different methods but also between fitting from in\nsitu measurements and reconstruction based on remote imaging. Here, we compare\nthree methods based on different assumptions for measurements of thirteen CMEs\nby the Wind spacecraft from 1997 to 2015. These CMEs are selected from the\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections catalog on\nthis https URL due to their simplicity in terms of 1)\nsmall expansion speed throughout the CME and 2) little asymmetry in the\nmagnetic field profile. This makes these thirteen events ideal candidates to\ncompare codes that do not include expansion nor distortion. We find that, for\nthese simple events, the codes are in relatively good agreement in terms of the\nCME axis orientation for six out of the 13 events. Using the Grad-Shafranov\ntechnique, we can determine the shape of the cross-section, which is assumed to\nbe circular for the other two models, a force-free fitting and a\ncircular-cylindrical non-force-free fitting. Five of the events are found to\nhave a clear circular cross-section, even when this is not a pre-condition of\nthe reconstruction. We make an initial attempt at evaluating the adequacy of\nthe different assumptions for these simple CMEs. The conclusion of this work\nstrongly suggests that attempts at reconciling in situ and remote-sensing views\nof CMEs must take in consideration the compatibility of the different models\nwith specific CME structures to better reproduce flux ropes.",

The analysis exploits a catalogue that was\ngenerated within the FP7 HELCATS project. Here, we focus on the observational\ncharacteristics of CMEs imaged in the heliosphere by the inner (HI-1) cameras.\nMore specifically, in this paper we present distributions of the basic\nobservational parameters - namely occurrence frequency, central position angle\n(PA) and PA span - derived from nearly 2000 detections of CMEs in the\nheliosphere by HI-1 on STEREO-A or STEREO-B from the minimum between Solar\nCycles 23 and 24 to the maximum of Cycle 24; STEREO-A analysis includes a\nfurther 158 CME detections from the descending phase of Cycle 24, by which time\ncommunication with STEREO-B had been lost. We compare heliospheric CME\ncharacteristics with properties of CMEs observed at coronal altitudes, and with\nsunspot number. As expected, heliospheric CME rates correlate with sunspot\nnumber, and are not inconsistent with coronal rates once instrumental\nfactors/differences in cataloguing philosophy are considered. As well as being\nmore abundant, heliospheric CMEs, like their coronal counterparts, tend to be\nwider during solar maximum. Our results confirm previous coronagraph analyses\nsuggesting that CME launch sites don't simply migrate to higher latitudes with\nincreasing solar activity. At solar minimum, CMEs tend to be launched from\nequatorial latitudes while, at maximum, CMEs appear to be launched over a much\nwider latitude range; this has implications for understanding the CME/solar\nsource association. Our analysis provides some supporting evidence for the\nsystematic dragging of CMEs to lower latitude as they propagate outwards.",

Previous estimations of the non-thermal electron\nenergy based on the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) data were incomplete since RHESSI missed the peak of the flare\nimpulsive phase. In contrast, HEND observed the whole flare. We used two models\nto estimate the energy of the non-thermal electrons: the cold thick target\nmodel and the warm thick target model. We found that, depending on the model\nused and the low-energy cutoff ($E_\\mathrm{c}$) of the non-thermal electrons,\nthe estimate of their total energy in the entire flare can vary from $2.3\n\\times 10^{32}$ to $6.2 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs. The lowest estimate, $2.3 \\times\n10^{32}$ ergs, obtained within the cold thick target model and fixed\n$E_\\mathrm{c}=43$ keV, is consistent with the previous estimate. In this case,\nnon-thermal electrons accelerated in the peak of the flare impulsive phase\nmissed by RHESSI contained approximately $40\\%$ of the total energy of\nnon-thermal electrons of the entire flare. The highest value, $6.2 \\times\n10^{33}$ ergs, obtained with the cold thick target model and fixed\n$E_\\mathrm{c}=10$ keV, looks abnormally high, since it exceeds the total\nnon-potential magnetic energy of the parent active region and the total\nbolometric energy radiated in the flare. Our estimates also show that the total\nnumber and energetics of the HXR-producing electrons in the flare region is a\nfew orders of magnitude higher than of the population of energetic electrons\ninjected into interplanetary space.",

That is why microgravity experiments of the\nphenomena involved are important to reveal the underlying physics. Because\nprevious experiments had some limitations, in particular short durations and\nconstrained dimensions, a new mission to study the very first stages of planet\nformation is proposed here. This mission, called Magrathea, is focused on\ncreating the best conditions for developing these experiments, using a\nsatellite with a 6 $m^3$ test chamber. During the mission 28 experiments are\nperformed using different dust compositions, sizes and shapes, to better\nunderstand under which conditions dust grains stick and aggregate. Each\nexperiment should last up to one month, with relative collision velocities of\nup to 5 mm/s, and initial dust sizes between 1 $\\mu$m and 1 mm. At least $10^6$\ncollisions per experiment should be recorded, to provide statistically\nsignificant results. Based on the scientific objectives and requirements, a\npreliminary analysis of the payload instrumentation is performed. From that a\nconceptual mission and spacecraft design is developed, together with a first\napproach to mission programmatic and risk analysis.

One possibility is that these planets formed in a circumbinary disc\nwhose midplane was inclined relative to the binary orbital plane.

We\nemployed 3D hydrodynamical simulations that examine the disc response to the\npresence of a modestly inclined binary with parameters that match the\nKepler-413 system, as a function of disc parameters and binary inclinations.\nThe discs all develop slowly varying warps, and generally display very small\namounts of twist.

The EU Framework Package 7 HELCATS project\nprovides catalogues of CME observations and properties from the Helio- spheric\nImagers onboard the two NASA/STEREO spacecraft in order to track the evolution\nof CMEs in the inner heliosphere. From the main HICAT catalogue of over 2,000\nCME detections, an automated algorithm has been developed to connect the CMEs\nobserved by STEREO to any corresponding solar flares and active region (AR)\nsources on the solar surface. CME kinematic properties, such as speed and\nangular width, are compared with AR magnetic field properties, such as magnetic\nflux, area, and neutral line characteristics. The resulting LOWCAT catalogue is\nalso compared to the extensive AR property database created by the EU Horizon\n2020 FLARECAST project, which provides more complex magnetic field parameters\nderived from vector magnetograms. Initial statistical analysis has been\nundertaken on the new data to provide insight into the link between flare and\nCME events, and characteristics of eruptive ARs. Warning thresholds determined\nfrom analysis of the evolution of these parameters is shown to be a useful\noutput for operational space weather purposes. Parameters of particular\ninterest for further analysis include total unsigned flux, vertical current,\nand current helicity. The automated method developed to create the LOWCAT\ncatalogue may also be useful for future efforts to develop operational CME\nforecasting.",

For the\nfirst time such a test is successfully carried out in space by the MICROSCOPE\nsatellite. Early results show no violation sourced by the Earth for Pt and Ti\ntest masses with random errors (after 8.26d of integration time) of about 1\npart in 1e14, and similar systematic this http URL improves by 10 times over the\nbest ground tests with rotating torsion balances despite 70 times less\nsensitivity to differential accelerations, thanks to the much stronger driving\nsignal in orbit. The test is limited by thermal noise from internal damping in\nthe gold wires used for electrical grounding. This noise was shown to decrease\nwhen the s/c was set to rotate faster than planned. The result will improve by\nthe end of the mission, as thermal noise decreases with more data. Not so\nsystematic errors. We investigate major non-gravitational effects and find that\nthe Pt-Pt sensor does not allow their separation from the signal. The early\ntest reports an upper limit of systematic errors in the Pt-Ti sensor which are\nnot detected in the Pt-Pt one, hence would not be distinguished from a\nviolation. Once all the integration time is used to reduce random noise there\nwill be no time left to check systematics. MICROSCOPE demonstrates the huge\npotential of space for WEP tests of very high precision and indicates how to\nreach it. To realize the potential, a new experiment needs the spacecraft to be\nin rapid, stable rotation around the symmetry axis, needs high quality\nstate-of-the-art mechanical suspensions, and must allow systematic checks. The\ndesign of the \"Galileo Galilei\" (GG) experiment, aiming to test the WEP to 1\npart in 1e17 unites all the needed features, indicating that a quantum leap in\nspace is possible provided the new experiment heeds the lessons of MICROSCOPE.",

We have analyzed MMS\nlocations during these these events and found that most of these electron\nleaking events were observed close to the southern high-altitude cusp and\nassociated boundaries, so these events may have a high-latitude source. Here we\npresent a new case study of observations of a MMS encounter of southern\nmagnetospheric cusp boundaries. In the magnetosheath side of the southern cusp,\nMMS observes both parallel streaming energetic ions, as well as a population\nwith 90 degree pitch angles. Subsequently, MMS detects plasma flows and\nmagnetic field rotation consistent with magnetic reconnection (operating above\nand dawn-ward of the MMS spacecraft), finally entering a depressed magnetic\nfield region with nearly stagnant flow. The depressed field region is occupied\nby high-fluxes of trapped high-energy electrons and protons, which resemble the\nCluster observations of cusp diamagnetic cavities at the northern hemisphere\n[Nykyri et al., 2011a]. However, the local magnetic field geometry during the\nprevailing IMF orientation is not favorable for magnetic reconnection to\ndirectly create a cavity in this location. We show that the plasma flows that\nwere observed prior to cavity observation satisfy the onset condition for the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability for 50 percent of all available k-vector\ndirections.",

We numerically explore\nthese mechanisms in a more magnetized regime. We find that (1) the plasma\nreveals spectral anisotropy in velocity space, due to the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field (analogous to spatial anisotropy of fluid and plasma\nturbulence); (2) the distribution of energy follows the prediction $P(m)\\sim\nm^{-2}$, proposed in the above theoretical-observational work; and (3) the\nvelocity-space activity is intermittent in space, being enhanced close to\ncoherent structures such as the reconnecting current sheets produced by\nturbulence. These results may be relevant to the nonlinear dynamics\nweakly-collisional plasma in a wide variety of circumstances.",

The JUpiter\nIcy Moons Explorer (JUICE), led by European Space Agency (ESA), has started\ndevelopment to explore the emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants. The\nGanymede Laser Altimeter (GALA) will be the first laser altimeter for icy\nbodies, and will measure the shape and topography of the large icy moons of\nJupiter, (globally for Ganymede, and using flyby ground-tracks for Europa and\nCallisto). Such information is crucial for understanding the formation of\nsurface features and can tremendously improve our understanding of the icy\ntectonics. In addition, the GALA will infer the presence or absence of a\nsubsurface ocean by measuring the tidal and rotational responses. Furthermore,\nit also improves the accuracy of gravity field measurements reflecting the\ninterior structure, collaborating with the radio science experiment. In\naddition to range measurements, the signal strength and the waveform of the\nlaser pulses reflected from the moon's surface contain information about\nsurface reflectance at the laser wavelength and small scale roughness.\nTherefore we can infer the degrees of chemical and physical alterations, e.g.,\nerosion, space weathering, compaction and deposition of exogenous materials,\nthrough GALA measurements without being affected by illumination conditions.\nJUICE spacecraft carries ten science payloads including GALA. They work closely\ntogether in a synergistic way with GALA being one of the key instruments for\nunderstanding the evolution of the icy satellites Ganymede, Europa, and\nCallisto.",

There is a strong debate about\nwhether or not a MFR exists prior to a CME and how the MFR forms/grows through\nmagnetic reconnection during the eruption. Here we report a rare event, in\nwhich a magnetic cloud was observed sequentially by four spacecraft near\nMercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, respectively. With the aids of a uniform-twist\nflux rope model and a newly developed method that can recover a\nshock-compressed structure, we find that the axial magnetic flux and helicity\nof the magnetic cloud decreased when it propagated outward but the twist\nincreased. Our analysis suggests that the `pancaking' effect and `erosion'\neffect may jointly cause such variations. The significance of the `pancaking'\neffect is difficult to be estimated, but the signature of the erosion can be\nfound as the imbalance of the azimuthal flux of the cloud. The latter implies\nthat the magnetic cloud was eroded significantly leaving its inner core exposed\nto the solar wind at far distance. The increase of the twist together with the\npresence of the erosion effect suggests that the post-eruption MFR may have a\nhigh-twist core enveloped by a less-twisted outer shell. These results pose a\ngreat challenge to the current understanding on the solar eruptions as well as\nthe formation and instability of MFRs.",

We conclude that the radio emission can\nescape the center of the CME core at a frequency of 60 MHz and originates from\nthe periphery of the core at frequency 30 MHz due to occultation by the solar\ncorona at corresponding frequencies. We find plasma densities in these regions\nsupposing the plasma mechanism of radio emission. We show that the frequency\ndrift of the start of the type IV burst is governed by an expansion of the CME\ncore. Type III bursts, which were observed against this type IV burst, are\nshown to be generated by fast electrons propagating through the CME core\nplasma. A type II burst registered at frequencies 44 - 64 MHz and 3 - 16 MHz\nwas radiated by a shock with a velocity of about 1000 km s^{-1} and 800 km\ns^{-1}, respectively.",

The exact\ndependence of this break scale on solar wind parameters has been extensively\nstudied but is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that\nreconnection may induce a break in the spectrum at a \"disruption scale\"\n$\\lambda_D$, which may be larger than the fundamental ion kinetic scales,\nproducing an unusually steep spectrum just below the break. We present a\nstatistical investigation of the dependence of the break scale on the proton\ngyroradius $\\rho_i$, ion inertial length $d_i$, ion sound radius $\\rho_s$,\nproton-cyclotron resonance scale $\\rho_c$ and disruption scale $\\lambda_D$ as a\nfunction of $\\beta_{\\perp i}$. We find that the steepest spectral indices of\nthe dissipation range occur when $\\beta_e$ is in the range of 0.1-1 and the\nbreak scale is only slightly larger than the ion sound scale (a situation\noccurring 41% of the time at 1 AU), in qualitative agreement with the\nreconnection model. In this range the break scale shows remarkably good\ncorrelation with $\\lambda_D$. Our findings suggest that, at least at low\n$\\beta_e$, reconnection may play an important role in the development of the\ndissipation range turbulent cascade and causes unusually steep (steeper than\n-3) spectral indices.",

Previous\nmeasurements in the fast solar wind obtained axisymmetric anisotropy, despite\nthat the analysis method allows nonaxisymmetric structures. These results are\nprobably contaminated by the wind expansion that introduces another symmetry\naxis, namely, the radial direction, as indicated by recent numerical\nsimulations. These simulations also show that while the expansion is strong,\nthe principal fluctuations are in the plane perpendicular to the radial\ndirection. Using this property, we separate 11 yr of Wind spacecraft data into\ntwo subsets characterized by strong and weak expansion and determine the\ncorresponding turbulence anisotropy. Under strong expansion, the small-scale\nanisotropy is consistent with the Goldreich & Sridhar critical balance. As in\nprevious works, when the radial symmetry axis is not eliminated, the turbulent\nstructures are field-aligned tubes. Under weak expansion, we find 3D anisotropy\npredicted by the Boldyrev model, that is, turbulent structures are ribbons and\nnot tubes. However, the very basis of the Boldyrev phenomenology, namely, a\ncross-helicity increasing at small scales, is not observed in the solar wind:\nthe origin of the ribbon formation is unknown.",

We report here on the results of our initial study\nof a mission to the deep outer regions of our solar system, with the primary\nmission objective of conducting direct megapixel high-resolution imaging and\nspectroscopy of a potentially habitable exoplanet by exploiting the remarkable\noptical properties of the SGL. Our main goal was to investigate what it takes\nto operate spacecraft at such enormous distances with the needed precision.\nSpecifically, we studied i) how a space mission to the focal region of the SGL\nmay be used to obtain high-resolution direct imaging and spectroscopy of an\nexoplanet by detecting, tracking, and studying the Einstein ring around the\nSun, and ii) how such information could be used to detect signs of life on\nanother planet. Our results indicate that a mission to the SGL with an\nobjective of direct imaging and spectroscopy of a distant exoplanet is\nchallenging, but possible. We composed a list of recommendations on the mission\narchitectures with risk and return tradeoffs and discuss an enabling technology\ndevelopment program.",

The HLSP, called K2Superstamp, consists of a series of\nFITS images for four open star clusters observed by the K2 Mission using\nso-called \"superstamp\" pixel masks: M35, the $\\sim$150 Myr old open cluster\nobserved during K2 Campaign 0, M67, the solar-age, solar-metallicity benchmark\ncluster observed during Campaign 5, Ruprecht 147, the $\\sim$3 Gyr-old open\ncluster observed during Campaign 7, and the Lagoon Nebula (M8/NGC 6530), the\nhigh-mass star-forming region observed during Campaign 9. While the data for\nthese regions have long been served on MAST, until now they were only available\nas a disconnected set of smaller Target Pixel Files (TPFs) because the\nspacecraft stored these observations in small chunks. As a result, these\nregions have hitherto been ignored by many lightcurve and planet search\npipelines. With this new release, we have stitched these TPFs together into\nspatially contiguous FITS images (one per cadence) to make their scientific\nanalysis easier. In addition, each image has been fit with an accurate WCS\nsolution so that you may locate any object of interest via its right ascension\nand declination. We describe here the process of stitching and astrometric\ncalibration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space object identification is vital for operating spacecraft, space traffic\ncontrol, and space situational awareness, but initial determination,\nmaintenance, and recovery of identity are all difficult, expensive, and\nerror-prone, especially for small objects like CubeSats. Attaching a beacon or\nlicense plate with a unique identification number to a space object before\nlaunch would greatly simplify the task, but radio beacons are power-hungry and\ncan cause interference. This paper describes a new concept for a satellite\nlicense plate, the Extremely Low Resource Optical Identifier or ELROI. ELROI is\na milliwatt-scale self-powered autonomous optical beacon that can be attached\nto any space object to transmit a persistent identification signal to ground\nstations. A system appropriate for a LEO CubeSat or other small space object\ncan fit in a package with the area of a postage stamp and a few millimeters\nthick, and requires no power, data, or control from the host object. The\nconcept has been validated with ground tests, and the first flight test unit is\nscheduled for launch in 2018. The unique identification number of a LEO\nsatellite can be determined unambiguously in a single orbital pass over a\nlow-cost ground station.",

Here I highlight key open questions about the physics of space\nplasmas and identify the aspects of these problems that can potentially be\ntackled in laboratory experiments. Several past successes in laboratory space\nphysics provide concrete examples of how complementary experiments can\ncontribute to our understanding of physical processes at play in the solar\ncorona, solar wind, planetary magnetospheres, and outer boundary of the\nheliosphere. I present developments on the horizon of laboratory space physics,\nidentifying velocity space as a key new frontier, highlighting new and enhanced\nexperimental facilities, and showcasing anticipated developments to produce\nimproved diagnostics and innovative analysis methods.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The B-field structures of two ICMEs each observed by a pair of spacecraft\nclose to radial alignment have been analysed. The ICMEs were observed in situ\nby MESSENGER and STEREO-B in Nov. 2010 and Nov. 2011, while the spacecraft were\nseparated by more than 0.6 AU in heliocentric distance, less than 4\u00b0 in\nheliographic longitude, and less than 7\u00b0 in heliographic latitude. Both\nICMEs took around 2 days to travel between the spacecraft. The ICME B-field\nprofiles observed by MESSENGER have been mapped to the heliocentric distance of\nSTEREO-B and compared directly to the profiles observed by STEREO-B. Figures\nthat result from this mapping allow for easy qualitative assessment of\nsimilarity in the profiles. Macroscale features in the profiles that varied on\ntimescales of 1 hour, and which corresponded to the underlying flux rope\nstructure of the ICMEs, were well correlated in the solar east-west and\nnorth-south directions, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of around 0.85\nand 0.95, respectively; microscale features with timescales of 1 minute were\nuncorrelated. Overall correlation values in the profiles of one ICME were\nincreased when an apparent change in the flux rope axis direction between the\nobserving spacecraft was taken into account. The high degree of similarity seen\nin the B-field profiles may be interpreted in in two ways. If the spacecraft\nsampled the same region of each ICME (i.e. if the spacecraft angular\nseparations can be neglected), the similarity indicates that there was little\nevolution in the underlying structure of the sampled region during propagation.\nAlternatively, if the spacecraft observed different, nearby regions within the\nICMEs, it indicates that there was spatial homogeneity across those different\nregions. The field structure similarity observed in these ICMEs points to the\nvalue of placing in situ space weather monitors well upstream of the Earth.",

The\nfinal result of such an analysis is a list of asteroids, ranked with respect to\nthe necessary propellant to be used, that the spacecraft could potentially\nreach. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of the produced asteroids\nrank to the employed trajectory model in the specific case of a small\nlow-thrust propelled spacecraft beginning its journey from the Sun-Earth $L_2$\nLagrangian point and heading to a rendezvous with some near-Earth asteroid. We\nconsider five increasingly complex trajectory models: impulsive, Lambert,\nnuclear electric propulsion, nuclear electric propulsion including the Earth's\ngravity, solar electric propulsion including the Earth's gravity and we study\nthe final correlation between the obtained target rankings. We find that the\nuse of a low-thrust trajectory model is of great importance for target\nselection, since the use of chemical propulsion surrogates leads to favouring\nless attractive options 19\\% of times, a percentage that drops to 8\\% already\nusing a simple nuclear electric propulsion model that neglects the Earth's\ngravity effects and thrust dependence on the solar distance. We also find that\nfor the study case considered, a small interplanetary CubeSat named M-ARGO, the\ninclusion of the Earth's gravity in the considered dynamics does not affect the\ntarget selection significantly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Mars thermosphere holds clues to the evolution of the Martian climate,\nand has practical implications for spacecraft visiting Mars, which often use it\nfor aerobraking upon arrival, or for landers, which must pass through it.\nNevertheless, it has been sparsely characterized, even when past accelerometer\nmeasurements and remote observations are taken into account. The Mars\nAtmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter, which includes a number of\ninstruments designed to characterize the thermosphere, has greatly expanded the\navailable thermospheric observations. This paper presents new and unanticipated\nmeasurements of density and temperature profiles (120-200 km) derived from\nsolar occultations using the MAVEN Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Monitor. These new\nmeasurements complement and expand MAVEN's intended thermospheric measurement\ncapacity. In particular, because the local-time is inherently fixed to the\nterminator, solar occultations are ideally suited for characterizing long-term\nand latitudinal variability. Occultation measurements are made during\napproximately half of all orbits, resulting in thousands of new thermospheric\nprofiles. The density retrieval method is presented in detail, including an\nuncertainty analysis. Altitude-latitude maps of thermospheric density and\ntemperature at perihelion and aphelion are presented, revealing structures that\nhave not been previously observed. Tracers of atmospheric dynamics are also\nobserved, including a high altitude polar warming feature at intermediate\nlatitudes, and an apparent thermostatic response to solar EUV heating during a\nsolar rotation, which shows heating at high altitudes that is accompanied by\ncooling at lower altitudes.",

Since beginning normal\nscience operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has operated with remarkable continuity,\ne.g. during the more than five years of the SDO prime mission that ended 30\nSeptember 2015, HMI collected 98.4% of all possible 45-second velocity maps;\nminimizing gaps in these full-disk Dopplergrams is crucial for helioseismology.\nHMI velocity, intensity, and magnetic-field measurements are used in numerous\ninvestigations, so understanding the quality of the data is important. We\ndescribe the calibration measurements used to track HMI performance and detail\ntrends in important instrument parameters during the mission. Regular\ncalibration sequences provide information used to improve and update the HMI\ndata calibration. The set-point temperature of the instrument front window and\noptical bench is adjusted regularly to maintain instrument focus, and changes\nin the temperature-control scheme have been made to improve stability in the\nobservable quantities. The exposure time has been changed to compensate for a\n15% decrease in instrument throughput. Measurements of the performance of the\nshutter and tuning mechanisms show that they are aging as expected and continue\nto perform according to specification. Parameters of the tunable-optical-filter\nelements are regularly adjusted to account for drifts in the central\nwavelength. Frequent measurements of changing CCD-camera characteristics, such\nas gain and flat field, are used to calibrate the observations. Infrequent\nexpected events, such as eclipses, transits, and spacecraft off-points,\ninterrupt regular instrument operations and provide the opportunity to perform\nadditional calibration. Onboard instrument anomalies are rare and seem to occur\nquite uniformly in time. The instrument continues to perform very well.",
