Currently, wider adoption of PBFAM is held\nback by difficulty in part qualification, high production costs and low\nproduction rates, as extensive process tuning, post-processing, and inspection\nare required before a final part can be produced and deployed. Physics-based\nmodeling and predictive simulation of PBFAM offers the potential to advance\nfundamental understanding of physical mechanisms that initiate process\ninstabilities and cause defects. In turn, these insights can help link process\nand feedstock parameters with resulting part and material properties, thereby\npredicting optimal processing conditions and inspiring the development of\nimproved processing hardware, strategies and materials. This work presents\nrecent developments of our research team in the modeling of metal PBFAM\nprocesses spanning length scales, namely mesoscale powder modeling, mesoscale\nmelt pool modeling, macroscale thermo-solid-mechanical modeling and\nmicrostructure modeling. Ongoing work in experimental validation of these\nmodels is also summarized.

While their success\nis strongly dependent on our understanding of underlying governing physical\nlaws, they suffer inherent limitations including trade-off between\nfidelity/accuracy and speed. The recent rise of Machine Learning (ML) proposes\na theory-agnostic paradigm. In complex multi-physics problems, however,\ncreating large enough datasets for successful training of ML models has proven\nto be challenging. One promising strategy to bridge the divide between these\napproaches and take advantage of their respective strengths is Theory-Guided\nMachine Learning (TGML) which aims to integrate physical laws into ML\nalgorithms. In this paper, three case studies on thermal management during\nprocessing of advanced composites are presented and studied using FE, ML and\nTGML. A structured approach to incrementally adding increasingly complex\nphysics to training of TGML model is presented. The benefits of TGML over ML\nmodels are seen in more accurate predictions, particularly outside the training\nregion, and ability to train with small datasets. One benefit of TGML over FE\nis significant speed improvement to potentially develop real-time feedback\nsystems.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel digital twin framework for stochastic nonlinear multi-degree of freedom\n(MDOF) dynamical systems. The approach proposed in this paper strategically\ndecouples the problem into two time-scales -- (a) a fast time-scale governing\nthe system dynamics and (b) a slow time-scale governing the degradation in the\nsystem. The proposed digital twin has four components - (a) a physics-based\nnominal model (low-fidelity), (b) a Bayesian filtering algorithm a (c) a\nsupervised machine learning algorithm and (d) a high-fidelity model for\npredicting future responses. The physics-based nominal model combined with\nBayesian filtering is used combined parameter state estimation and the\nsupervised machine learning algorithm is used for learning the temporal\nevolution of the parameters. While the proposed framework can be used with any\nchoice of Bayesian filtering and machine learning algorithm, we propose to use\nunscented Kalman filter and Gaussian process. Performance of the proposed\napproach is illustrated using two examples. Results obtained indicate the\napplicability and excellent performance of the proposed digital twin framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Linear impulsively controlled systems are suitable to describe a venue of\nreal-life problems, going from disease treatment to aerospace guidance. The\nmain characteristic of such systems is that they remain uncontrolled for\ncertain periods of time. As a consequence, punctual equilibria\ncharacterizations outside the origin are no longer useful, and the whole\nconcept of equilibrium and its natural extension, the controlled invariant\nsets, needs to be redefined. Also, an exact characterization of the admissible\nstates, i.e., states such that their uncontrolled evolution between impulse\ntimes remain within a predefined set, is required. An approach to such tasks --\nbased on the Markov-Lukasz theorem -- is presented, providing a tractable and\nnon-conservative characterization, emerging from polynomial positivity that has\napplication to systems with rational eigenvalues. This is in turn the basis for\nobtaining a tractable approximation to the maximal admissible invariant sets.\nIn this work, it is also demonstrated that, in order for the problem to have a\nsolution, an invariant set (and moreover, an equilibrium set) must be contained\nwithin the target zone. To assess the proposal, the so-obtained impulsive\ninvariant set is explicitly used in the formulation of a set-based model\npredictive controller, with application to zone tracking. In this context,\nspecific MPC theory needs to be considered, as the target is not necessarily\nstable in the sense of Lyapunov. A zone MPC formulation is proposed, which is\nable to i) track an invariant set such that the uncontrolled propagation\nfulfills the zone constraint at all times and ii) converge asymptotically to\nthe set of periodic orbits completely contained within the target zone.",

MSLWEB is an internal data tracking tool used by operations\nstaff to perform first pass analysis on MSL image sequences, a series of\nproducts taken by the Mast camera, Mastcam. Mastcam's multiband multispectral\nimage sequences require more complex analysis compared to standard 3-band RGB\nimages. Typically, these are analyzed using traditional methods to identify\nunique features within the sequence. Given the short time frame of tactical\nplanning in which downlinked images might need to be analyzed (within 5-10\nhours before the next uplink), there exists a need to triage analysis time to\nfocus on the most important sequences and parts of a sequence. We address this\nneed by creating products for MSLWEB that use novelty detection to help\noperations staff identify unusual data that might be diagnostic of new or\natypical compositions or mineralogies detected within an imaging scene. This\nwas achieved in two ways: 1) by creating products for each sequence to identify\nnovel regions in the image, and 2) by assigning multispectral sequences a\nsortable novelty score. These new products provide colorized heat maps of\ninferred novelty that operations staff can use to rapidly review downlinked\ndata and focus their efforts on analyzing potentially new kinds of diagnostic\nmultispectral signatures. This approach has the potential to guide scientists\nto new discoveries by quickly drawing their attention to often subtle\nvariations not detectable with simple color composites.",

Additionally, a short memory principle is employed to\novercome the difficulty of implementing the fractional-order calculus on a\npractical system in real-time. Here, the short memory principle may increase\nthe tracking errors because some information is lost during its operation.\nThus, a compensator according to the framework of Bellman's optimal control\ntheory is proposed so that the residual errors caused by the short memory\nprinciple can be attenuated.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The quest for reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in transport\nhas been a powerful driving force for scientific research into methods that\nmight underpin drag-reducing technologies for a variety of vehicular transport\non roads, by rail, in the air, and on or in the water. In civil aviation,\nskin-friction drag accounts for around 50% of the total drag in cruise\nconditions, thus being a preferential target for research. With laminar\nconditions excluded, skin friction is intimately linked to the turbulence\nphysics in the fluid layer closest to the skin. Thus, research into drag\nreduction has focused on methods to depress the turbulence activity near the\nsurface. The most effective method of doing so is to subject the drag-producing\nflow in the near-wall layer to an unsteady and/or spatially varying cross-flow\ncomponent, either by the action of transverse wall oscillations, by embedding\nrotating discs into the surface or by plasma-producing electrodes that\naccelerate the near-wall fluid in the transverse direction. In ideal\nconditions, drag-reduction margins of order of 50% can be achieved. The present\narticle provides a review of research into the response of turbulent near-wall\nlayers to the imposition of unsteady and wavy transverse motion, encompassing\nexperiments, simulation, analysis and modelling. It covers issues such as the\ndrag-reduction margin in a variety of actuation scenarios, the underlying\nphysical phenomena that contribute to the interpretation of the origin of the\ndrag reduction, the dependence of the drag reduction on the Reynolds number,\npassive control methods that are inspired by active control, and a forward look\ntowards possible future research and practical realizations. The authors hope\nthat this review, by far the most extensive of its kind for this subject, will\nbe judged as a useful foundation for future research targeting friction-drag\nreduction",

We tested two configurations with the lattice material\ninstalled at the windward and leeward regions. On the one hand, the windward\nconfiguration showed a strong Re dependency, with a drag reduction of up to 45%\nat Re=11E4. On the other hand, the lattice material in the leeward region\nreduced the drag by 25% with weak Re dependency. Alterations of the lattice\nmaterial topology had a noticeable effect on the drag reduction in both cases.\nAdding aerodynamic features to the already proven beneficial structural\nproperties of 3D lattice materials might aid in the development of low-powered\nautomotive, naval, and aerospace vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A novel approach to reduced-order modeling of high-dimensional time varying\nsystems is proposed. It leverages the formalism of the Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition technique together with the concept of balanced realization. It\nis assumed that the only information available on the system comes from input,\nstate, and output trajectories generated by numerical simulations or recorded\nand estimated during experiments, thus the approach is fully data-driven. The\ngoal is to obtain an input-output low dimensional linear model which\napproximates the system across its operating range. Since the dynamics of\naeroservoelastic systems markedly changes in operation (e.g. due to change in\nflight speed or altitude), time-varying features are retained in the\nconstructed models. This is achieved by generating a Linear Parameter-Varying\nrepresentation made of a collection of state-consistent linear time-invariant\nreduced-order models. The algorithm formulation hinges on the idea of replacing\nthe orthogonal projection onto the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition modes, used\nin Dynamic Mode Decomposition-based approaches, with a balancing oblique\nprojection constructed entirely from data. As a consequence, the input-output\ninformation captured in the lower-dimensional representation is increased\ncompared to other projections onto subspaces of same or lower size. Moreover, a\nparameter-varying projection is possible while also achieving\nstate-consistency. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a\nmorphing wing for airborne wind energy applications by comparing the\nperformance against two algorithms recently proposed in the literature.\nComparisons cover both prediction accuracy and performance in model predictive\ncontrol applications.",

In this\npaper, the mechanism of engine unstart is discussed from the point of view of\nshock/shock interaction and deflagration-to-detonation transition. The\nshock/shock interaction leads to the nonlinear, transient and discontinuous\nprocess of the supersonic combustion flow field. This process is similar to the\ndeflagration-to-detonation transition process. If the velocity of\npre-combustion shock wave is faster than the velocity in the isolator, it will\npropagate upstream and cause the engine unstart. The C-J detonation velocity is\ndefined as the stable operation boundary of scramjets, which is the maximum\nshock wave produced by combustion theoretically. The scramjets will work stable\nif the velocity in the isolator is faster than the corresponding C-J detonation\nvelocity. The combustion characteristics and propulsive performance of\nscramjets is theoretically analyzed by using C-J detonation theory. For high\nMach number scramjets, the velocity in the isolator is much faster than the C-J\ndetonation velocity. Therefore, extra fuel and oxygen can be injected into the\ncombustor to increase the thrust as long as the shock wave velocity driven by\nthe combustion products is slower than the air velocity in the isolator. The\ntheoretical results agree well with the existing experimental results, which\ncan be used as a baseline for the development of scramjets.",

Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an\neffective system for model development that streamlines data curation,\ntraining, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images\nof a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This\npaper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically\nfor on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges.\nThe core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a\ncloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development\nprocess.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Industrial inspection automation in aerospace presents numerous challenges\ndue to the dynamic, information-rich and regulated aspects of the domain. To\ndiagnose the condition of an aircraft component, expert inspectors rely on a\nsignificant amount of procedural and tacit knowledge (know-how). As systems\ncapabilities do not match high level human cognitive functions, the role of\nhumans in future automated work systems will remain important. A\nCyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) is a suitable solution that envisions\nhumans and agents in a joint activity to enhance cognitive/computational\ncapabilities and produce better outcomes. This paper investigates how a\nwork-centred approach can support and guide the engineering process of a CPSS\nwith an industrial use case. We present a robust methodology that combines\nfieldwork inquiries and model-based engineering to elicit and formalize rich\nmental models into exploitable design patterns. Our results exhibit how\ninspectors process and apply knowledge to diagnose the component`s condition,\nhow they deal with the institution`s rules and operational constraints (norms,\nsafety policies, standard operating procedures). We suggest how these patterns\ncan be incorporated in software modules or can conceptualize Human-Agent\nTeaming requirements. We argue that this framework can corroborate the right\nfit between a system`s technical and ecological validity (system fit with\noperating context) that enhances data reliability, productivity-related factors\nand system acceptance by end-users.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We propose a design that uses the principle of chaos for UAV secure\ncommunication. A UAV identified as an aerial base station communicates with a\nground base station over an RF channel. The communication units have dynamics\nbased on the logistic map. The map is chaotic in the appropriate parameter\nspace. Its states are non-periodic, broadband, and noise-like in the frequency\ndomain. They are useful for spreading information during transmission, making\nit difficult for an eavesdropper to recover the modulated message since state\nprediction is ultimately impossible. To retrieve it, we propose a variable\nfeedback controller. It asymptotically stabilizes the error dynamics when the\ninformation source is off. During transmission, the controller synchronizes the\nunits such that the error contains signatures of the information signal.\nTherefore, the information signal is retrievable by a suitable detection\nmechanism. Security depends on the confidentiality of the map, the variable\nfeedback controller, including its scale factor and bounded feedback gain, and\nthe designer`s choice of invertible function for use in the scrambling and\ndescrambling process. Also, the method is less prone to jamming attacks and\nmultipath effects as the broadband spectrum can be used to randomly select RF\nchannels. It uses only a few simple algorithms, including a correlation\nsummation and a detection mechanism. The algorithms collect subsamples of the\nreceived signal sequences and averages over each subsample length. The method\nrequires minimal programming efforts and low hardware resource utilization. It\nis energy-efficient, which is a vital consideration for any UAV security model.\nMoreover, we realize a prototype of the communication system on\nfield-programmable gate arrays. We presented a digital design of the secure\ncommunication system involving the transmission of bitstreams between the ABS\nand GBS.",

A key example of such a physical\nsystem is thermoacoustic instability in combustion, where prediction or early\ndetection of an onset of instability is a hard technical challenge, which needs\nto be addressed to build safer and more energy-efficient gas turbine engines\npowering aerospace and energy industries. The instabilities arising in\ncombustion chambers of engines are mathematically too complex to model. To\naddress this issue in a data-driven manner instead, we propose a novel deep\nlearning architecture called 3D convolutional selective autoencoder (3D-CSAE)\nto detect the evolution of self-excited oscillations using spatiotemporal data,\ni.e., hi-speed videos taken from a swirl-stabilized combustor (laboratory\nsurrogate of gas turbine engine combustor). 3D-CSAE consists of filters to\nlearn, in a hierarchical fashion, the complex visual and dynamic features\nrelated to combustion instability. We train the 3D-CSAE on frames of videos\nobtained from a limited set of operating conditions. We select the 3D-CSAE\nhyper-parameters that are effective for characterizing hierarchical and\nmultiscale instability structure evolution by utilizing the dynamic information\navailable in the video. The proposed model clearly shows performance\nimprovement in detecting the precursors of instability. The machine\nlearning-driven results are verified with physics-based off-line measures.\nAdvanced active control mechanisms can directly leverage the proposed online\ndetection capability of 3D-CSAE to mitigate the adverse effects of combustion\ninstabilities on the engine operating under various stringent requirements and\nconditions.",

Optimal courses of\naction for structures are selected by determining the strategies that maximise\nexpected utility. The risk-based framework is demonstrated on a realistic\ntruss-like structure and supported by experimental data.

These mixed flows often involve\nbulk motion of hundreds of billions of individual sediment particles and can\ncontain both highly turbulent regions and static, non-flowing regions. This\nbreadth of phenomena necessitates the use of continuum simulation methods, such\nas the material point method (MPM), which can accurately capture these large\ndeformations while also tracking the Lagrangian features of the flow (e.g.\\ the\ngranular surface, elastic stress, etc.).\nRecent works using two-phase MPM frameworks to simulate these mixtures have\nshown substantial promise; however, these approaches are hindered by the\nnumerical limitations of MPM when simulating pure fluids. In addition to the\nwell-known particle ringing instability and difficulty defining inflow/outflow\nboundary conditions, MPM has a tendency to accumulate quadrature errors as\nmaterials deform, increasing the rate of overall error growth as simulations\nprogress. In this work, we present an improved, two-phase continuum simulation\nframework that uses the finite volume method (FVM) to solve the fluid phase\nequations of motion and MPM to solve the solid phase equations of motion,\nsubstantially reducing the effect of these errors and providing better accuracy\nand stability for long-duration simulations of these mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The aerospace industry relies on massive collections of complex and technical\ndocuments covering system descriptions, manuals or procedures. This paper\npresents a question answering (QA) system that would help aircraft pilots\naccess information in this documentation by naturally interacting with the\nsystem and asking questions in natural language. After describing each module\nof the dialog system, we present a multi-task based approach for the QA module\nwhich enables performance improvement on a Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM)\ndataset. A method to combine scores from the retriever and the QA modules is\nalso presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper describes the envisioned interactions between the information and\ncommunication technology and aerospace industries to serve autonomous devices\nfor next generation aerial parcel delivery networks. The autonomous features of\nfleet elements of the delivery network are enabled by the increased throughput,\nimproved coverage, and near-user computation capabilities of vertical\nheterogeneous networks (VHetNets). A high altitude platform station (HAPS),\nlocated around 20~km above the ground level in a quasi-stationary manner,\nserves as the main enabler of the vision we present. In addition to the sensing\npotential of the HAPS nodes, the use of communication, computing, and caching\ncapabilities demonstrate the attainability of the ambitious goal of serving a\nfully autonomous aerial fleet capable of addressing instantaneous user demands\nand enabling supply chain management interactions with delivery services in\nlow-latency settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Maritime surveillance (MS) is of paramount importance for search and rescue\noperations, fishery monitoring, pollution control, law enforcement, migration\nmonitoring, and national security policies. Since ground-based radars and\nautomatic identification system (AIS) do not always provide a comprehensive and\nseamless coverage of the entire maritime domain, the use of space-based sensors\nis crucial to complement them. We reviewed space-based technologies for MS in\nthe first part of this work, titled \"Space-based Global Maritime Surveillance.\nPart I: Satellite Technologies\" [1]. However, future MS systems combining\nmultiple terrestrial and space-based sensors with additional information\nsources will require dedicated artificial intelligence and data fusion\ntechniques for the processing of raw satellite images and fuse heterogeneous\ninformation. The second part of our work focuses on the most promising\nartificial intelligence and data fusion techniques for MS using space-based\nsensors.",
