The results presented here assume the control gain to satisfy\npersistence of excitation which is a necessary condition for existence of\nstabilizing controllers in the presence of unstable drift. This work involves a\nnovel persistence filter construction and provides a significant extension to\nthe authors' previous result on stabilization of single-input linear systems\nwith time-varying singular gains. An application to underactuated spacecraft\nstabilization is shown which illustrates the interesting features of the\ntime-varying control design in stabilization of nonlinear dynamical systems.\nFinally, the development of an observer counterpart of these results is\npresented in the presence of multiple-outputs subject to singular measurement\ngains.",

The aim is to test the field-line braiding mechanism\nfor a sufficient coronal energy input.

Our\n3D-MHD model is driven from below by Hinode observations of the photosphere, in\nparticular a high-cadence time series of line-of-sight magnetograms and\nhorizontal velocities derived from the magnetograms. This driving applies\nstress to the magnetic field and thereby delivers magnetic energy into the\ncorona, where currents are induced that heat the coronal plasma by Ohmic\ndissipation. We compute synthetic coronal emission that we directly compare to\ncoronal observations of the same active region taken by Hinode. In the model,\ncoronal loops form at the same places as they are found in coronal\nobservations. Even the shapes of the synthetic loops in 3D space match those\nfound from a stereoscopic reconstruction based on STEREO spacecraft data. Some\nloops turn out to be slightly over-dense in the model, as expected from\nobservations. This shows that the spatial and temporal distribution of the\nOhmic heating produces the structure and dynamics of a coronal loops system\nclose to what is found in observations.",

We present a composite analysis of pre-perihelion light-curves of\nfive Kreutz comets that covered to $\\sim 1$~AU. We observe a significant\ndiversity in the light-curves that can be used to grossly classify them into\ntwo types: C/Ikeya-Seki and C/SWAN follow the canonical $r_\\mathrm{H}^{-4}$\nwhile the others follow $r_\\mathrm{H}^{-7}$. In particular, C/SWAN seems to\nhave undergone an outburst ($\\Delta m>5$~mag) or a rapid brightening\n($n\\gtrsim11$) between $r_\\mathrm{H}=1.06$~AU to $0.52$~AU, and shows hints of\nstructural/compositional differences compared to other bright Kreutz comets. We\nalso find evidence that the Kreutz comets as a population lose their mass less\nefficiently than the dynamically new comet, C/ISON, and are relatively devoid\nof species that drive C/ISON's activity at large $r_\\mathrm{H}$. Concurrent\nobservations of C/STEREO in different wavelengths also suggest that a blue-ward\nspecies such as CN may be the main driver for brightening burst instead of\npreviously-thought sodium.",

In addition to tens of pulsation\nfrequencies in the g-mode domain, its Fourier spectrum shows three weak peaks\nat very low frequencies, which is too low to be explained in terms of g modes.\nThe most convincing explanation is that we are seeing the orbital modulation of\nthree Earth-size planets (or planetary remnants) in very tight orbits, which\nare illuminated by the strong stellar radiation. The orbital periods are\nP1=5.273, P2=7.807, and P3=19.48 hours, and the period ratios P2/P1=1.481 and\nP3/P2=2.495 are very close to the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances, respectively. One of\nthe main pulsation modes of the star at 210.68 {\\mu}Hz corresponds to the third\nharmonic of the orbital frequency of the inner planet, suggesting that we see,\nfor the first time in an sdB star, g-mode pulsations tidally excited by a\nplanetary companion. The extreme planetary system that emerges from the Kepler\ndata is very similar to the recent discovery of two Earth-size planets orbiting\nthe sdB pulsator KIC05807616 (Charpinet et al. 2011a).",

The 3\nspacecrafts range interferometrically with one another with arm length about\n260 million kilometers. For 260 times longer arm length, the detection\nsensitivity of ASTROD-GW is 260 fold better than that of eLISA/NGO in the lower\nfrequency region by assuming the same acceleration noise. Therefore, ASTROD-GW\nwill be a better cosmological probe. In previous papers, we have worked out the\ntime delay interferometry (TDI) for the ecliptic formation. To resolve the\nreflection ambiguity about the ecliptic plane in source position determination,\nwe have changed the basic formation into slightly inclined formation with\nhalf-year precession-period. In this paper, we optimize a set of 10-year\ninclined ASTROD-GW mission orbits numerically using ephemeris framework\nstarting at June 21, 2035, including cases of inclination angle is 0\u00b0 (no\ninclination), 0.5\u00b0, 1.0\u00b0, 1.5\u00b0, 2.0\u00b0, 2.5\u00b0 and\n3.0\u00b0. We simulate the time delays of the first and second generation TDI\nconfigurations for the different inclinations, and compare/analyse the\nnumerical results to attain the requisite sensitivity of ASTROD-GW by\nsuppressing laser frequency noise below the secondary noises. To explicate our\ncalculation process for different inclination cases, we take the 1.0\u00b0 as\nexample to show the orbit optimization and TDI simulation.",

After\nthermalization of this energy gain per shock passage through the operation of\nthe Buneman instability, strong electron heating occurs that substantially\ninfluences the radial electron temperature profile. We describe the reduction\nof the jump amplitude due to energy expended by the traveling jump structure.\nWe consider three effects; namely energy loss due to heating of electrons,\nenergy loss due to work done against the pick-up-ion pressure gradient, and an\nenergy gain due to nonlinear jump steepening. Taking these effects into\naccount, we show that the decrease in jump amplitude with solar distance is\nmore pronounced when the initial jump amplitude is higher in the inner solar\nsystem. Independent of the initial jump amplitude, it eventually decreases with\nincreasing distance to a value of the order of $\\Delta U/U\\simeq 0.1$ at the\nposition of the heliospheric termination shock, where $\\Delta U$ is the jump\namplitude, and $U$ is the average solar-wind bulk velocity.The electron\ntemperature, on the other hand, is strongly correlated with the initial jump\namplitude, leading to electron temperatures between 6000 K and 20 000 K at\ndistances beyond 50 AU.

In this\nhovering model, both the position and attitude of the spacecraft are kept to be\nstationary in the asteroid body-fixed frame. A Hamiltonian structure-based\nfeedback control law is proposed to stabilize the relative equilibria of the\nfull dynamics to achieve the orbit-attitude hovering. The control law is\nconsisted of two parts: potential shaping and energy dissipation. The potential\nshaping is to make the relative equilibrium a minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold by modifying the potential artificially.\nWith the energy-Casimir method, it is shown that the unstable relative\nequilibrium can always be stabilized in the Lyapunov sense by the potential\nshaping with sufficiently large feedback gains. Then the energy dissipation\nleads the motion to converge asymptotically to the minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold, i.e., the relative equilibrium. The\nfeasibility of the proposed stabilization control law is validated through\nnumerical simulations in the case of a spacecraft orbiting around a small\nasteroid. The main advantage of the proposed hovering control law is that it is\nvery simple and is easy to implement autonomously by the spacecraft with little\ncomputation. This advantage is attributed to the utilization of dynamical\nbehaviors of the system in the control design.",

An asteroid's irregular shape, non-spherical mass\ndistribution and its rotational sate make the dynamics of spacecraft quite\ncomplex. This paper focuses on the gravity gradient torque of spacecraft around\nnon-spherical asteroids. The gravity field of the asteroid is approximated as a\n2nd degree and order-gravity field with harmonic coefficients C20 and C22. By\nintroducing the spacecraft's higher-order inertia integrals, a full\nfourth-order gravity gradient torque model of the spacecraft is established\nthrough the gravitational potential derivatives. Our full fourth-order model is\nmore precise than previous fourth-order model due to the consideration of\nhigher-order inertia integrals of the spacecraft. Some interesting conclusions\nabout the gravity gradient torque model are reached. Then a numerical\nsimulation is carried out to verify our model. In the numerical simulation, a\nspecial spacecraft consisted of 36 point masses connected by rigid massless\nrods is considered. We assume that the asteroid is in a uniform rotation around\nits maximum-moment principal axis, and the spacecraft is on the stationary\norbit in the equatorial plane. Simulation results show that the motion of\nprevious fourth-order model is quite different from the exact motion, while our\nfull fourth-order model fits the exact motion very well.

Although several\nproperties seem at first different for small FRs and MCs, we show that they are\nactually governed by the same propagation physics. For example, we observe no\nin situ signatures of expansion for small FRs, contrary to MCs. We demonstrate\nthat this result is in fact expected: small FRs expand similarly to MCs, as a\nconsequence of a total pressure balance with the surrounding medium, but the\nexpansion signature is well hidden by velocity fluctuations.\nNext, we find that the FR radius, velocity and magnetic field strength are\nall positively correlated, with correlation factors than can reach a value\n>0.5. This result indicates a remnant trace of the FR ejection process from the\ncorona. We also find a larger FR radius at the apex than at the legs (up to\nthree times larger at the apex), for FR observed at 1 AU.\nFinally, assuming that the detected FRs have a large-scale configuration in\nthe heliosphere, we derived the mean axis shape from the probability\ndistribution of the axis orientation.

We present a technique for generating photometric light curves from\npixel-level data obtained with the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2. Our\nphotometric technique accounts for the non-uniform pixel response function of\nthe Kepler detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's\npointing and removing the dependence. When we apply our technique to the\nensemble of stars observed during the Kepler Two-Wheel Concept Engineering\nTest, we find improvements over raw K2 photometry by factors of 2-5, with noise\nproperties qualitatively similar to Kepler targets at the same magnitudes. We\nfind evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each\ntarget's position in the Kepler field of view, with worst precision near the\nedges of the field. Overall, this technique restores the median attainable\nphotometric precision to within a factor of two of the original Kepler\nphotometric precision for targets ranging from 10$^{th}$ to 15$^{th}$ magnitude\nin the Kepler bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35% that of\nKepler for stars between 12$^{th}$ and 13$^{th}$ magnitude in the Kepler\nbandpass.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We report on a study of all major solar eruptions that occurred on the\nfront-side of the Sun during the rise to peak phase of cycle 24 (first 62\nmonths) in order to understand the key factors affecting the occurrence of\nlarge solar energetic particle events (SEPs) and the ground levels enhancement\n(GLE) events. The eruptions involve major flares with soft X-ray peak flux >/=\n5.0 x10-5 Wm-2 (i.e., flare size >/= M5.0) and accompanying coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). The selection criterion was based on the fact that the only\nfront-side GLE in cycle 24 (GLE 71) had a flare size of M5.1. Only ~37% of the\nmajor eruptions from the western hemisphere resulted in large SEP events.\nAlmost the same number of large SEP events was produced in weaker eruptions\n(flare size <M5.0), suggesting that the soft X-ray flare is not a good\nindicator of SEP or GLE events. On the other hand, the CME speed is a better\nindicator of SEP and GLE events because it is consistently high supporting the\nshock acceleration mechanism for SEPs and GLEs. We found the CME speed,\nmagnetic connectivity to Earth, and ambient conditions as the main factors that\ncontribute to the lack of high energy particle events during cycle 24. Several\neruptions poorly connected to Earth (eastern-hemisphere or behind-the-west-limb\nevents) resulted in very large SEP events detected by the STEREO spacecraft.\nSome very fast CMEs, likely to have accelerated particles to GeV energies, did\nnot result in a GLE event because of poor latitudinal connectivity. The\nstringent latitudinal requirement suggests that the highest energy particles\nare likely accelerated in the nose part of shocks. There were also\nwell-connected fast CMEs, which did not seem to have accelerated high energy\nparticles due to possible unfavorable ambient conditions (high Alfven speed,\noverall reduction in acceleration efficiency in cycle 24).",

We find that the number of minor ECs has\nstayed roughly constant and the ECs have similar distributions of angular\nwidth, absolute brightness, and semimajor axis. However, the common\nexceptionally bright ECs seen by Voyager are now exceedingly rare, with only\ntwo instances seen by Cassini in the six years, and they are now also much\ndimmer relative to the mean ring background.

For the mean\n(linear) velocity, the arithmetic mean is $254\\pm76$ km s$^{-1}$ (within a\nrange of 130$-$470 km s$^{-1}$). 52 % of all waves under study show a distinct\ndeceleration during their propagation ($a\\leq-50$ m s$^{-2}$), the other 48 %\nare consistent with a constant speed within the uncertainties ($-50\\leq\na\\leq50$ m s$^{-2}$).

The (smooth) transition\nbetween constant propagation for slow events and deceleration in faster events\noccurs at an EUV wave start velocity of $v\\approx230$ km s$^{-1}$, which\ncorresponds well to the fast-mode speed in the quiet corona. These findings\nprovide strong evidence that the EUV waves under study are indeed\nlarge-amplitude fast-mode MHD waves. This interpretation is further supported\nby the correlations obtained between the peak velocity and the peak amplitude,\nimpulsiveness, and build-up time of the disturbance. We obtained the following\nassociation rates of EUV wave events to other solar phenomena: 95 % are\nassociated with a coronal mass ejection (CME), 74 % to a solar flare, 15 % to\ninterplanetary type II bursts, and 22 % to coronal type II bursts.

In situ\nparticle measurements show that: (1) The profiles of the proton fluxes are\nhighly dependent of the locations of their solar sources, namely flares or\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs); (2) The solar particle release (SPR) times fall\nin the decay phase of the flare emission, and are in accordance with the times\nwhen the CMEs travel to an average height of 7.9 solar radii; (3) The time\ndifferences between the SPR and the flare peak are also dependent of the\nlocations of the solar active regions (ARs).

This\ndiscrepancy is particularly important for the high-frequency QPO at ~625 Hz.\nHowever, previous analyses did not systematically test whether the signal could\nalso be there in much shorter data segments, more consistent with the\ntheoretical predictions. Here, we test for the presence of the high-frequency\nQPO at 625 Hz in data from both the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the\nRamaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) systematically both in\nindividual rotational cycles of the neutron star, as well as averaged over\nmultiple successive rotational cycles at the same phase. We find that the QPO\nin the RXTE data is consistent with being only present in a single cycle, for a\nshort duration of ~0.5s, whereas the RHESSI data are as consistent with a\nshort-lived signal that appears and disappears as with a long-lived QPO.

FLRW manifold is covered by global coordinates (t,y^i),\nwhere t is the cosmic time coinciding with the proper time of the Hubble\nobservers. We introduce local inertial coordinates x^a=(x^0,x^i) in the\nvicinity of a world line of a Hubble observer with the help of a special\nconformal transformation. The local inertial metric is Minkowski flat and is\nmaterialized by the congruence of time-like geodesics of static observers being\nat rest with respect to the local spatial coordinates x^i. We consider geodesic\nmotion of test particles and notice that the local coordinate time x^0=x^0(t)\ntaken as a parameter along the world line of particle, is a function of the\nHubble's observer time t. This function changes smoothly from x^0=t for a\nparticle at rest (observer's clock), to x^0=t+1/2 Ht^2 for photons, where H is\nthe Hubble constant. Thus, motion of a test particle is non-uniform when its\nworld line is parametrized by time t. NASA JPL Orbit Determination Program\npresumes that motion of light (after the Shapiro delay is excluded) is uniform\nwith respect to the time t but it does not comply with the non-uniform motion\nof light on cosmological manifold. For this reason, the motion of light in the\nsolar system analysed with the Orbit Determination Program appears as having a\nsystematic blue shift of frequency, of radio waves circulating in the\nEarth-spacecraft radio link. The magnitude of the anomalous blue shift of\nfrequency is proportional to the Hubble constant H that may open an access to\nthe measurement of this fundamental cosmological parameter in the solar system\nradiowave experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Spacecraft data reveal a very Earth-like Jovian magnetic field. This is\nsurprising since numerical simulations have shown that the vastly different\ninteriors of terrestrial and gas planets can strongly affect the internal\ndynamo process. Here we present the first numerical dynamo that manages to\nmatch the structure and strength of the observed magnetic field by embracing\nthe newest models for Jupiter's interior. Simulated dynamo action primarily\noccurs in the deep high electrical conductivity region while zonal flows are\ndynamically constrained to a strong equatorial jet in the outer envelope of low\nconductivity. Our model reproduces the structure and strength of the observed\nglobal magnetic field and predicts that secondary dynamo action associated to\nthe equatorial jet produces banded magnetic features likely observable by the\nJuno mission. Secular variation in our model scales to about 2000 nT per year\nand should also be observable during the one year nominal mission duration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The present work is aimed to explain why we started to consider Vibrating\nRays Theory (VRT) as a viable representation of nature, and to elaborate some\nof its consequences. In 1846 Faraday introduced the concept of vibrating rays,\nin which an atom is conceived as having rays that extend to infinity and move\nwith it. According to this point of view, electromagnetic radiative phenomena\ncorrespond to vibration of these rays, which propagate at speed c relative to\nthe rays (and the atom). Although a discussion on this subject might seem to be\nout-of-date, there are many reasons that justified this debate. The first\nreason is based on the fact that the constancy of the speed of light,\nirrespective of the source movement, has not been demonstrated experimentally\nin a conclusive way. In fact, only ballistic emission theories can be discarded\nby the experimental results. The second reason is based on the fact that study\nof radiometric data from spacecrafts indicates the existence of different kinds\nof anomalous Doppler residuals. We will show that these anomalies exhibit a\nsignature of Vibrating Rays Theory. The third reason is related to the time\ndefinition in a rotating frame. According to SRT there is not a unique way to\nassign a time, whereas under VRT no contradictions are present. And finally,\nthat a properly stated Vibrating Rays Theory is compatible with all known\nexperiments on electromagnetism and light propagation. In the present work we\nwill (1) explain how VRT should be interpreted, and why past experiments were\nmisinterpreted, (2) show the characteristics of VRT that are present in\nspacecraft anomalies, (3) give a possible theoretical model (including the\npossible presence of longitudinal waves), and (4) describe results in an\nongoing experiment designed to distinguish between VRT and SRT models.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present an analysis of the fast coronal mass ejection (CME) of 2012 March\n7, which was imaged by both STEREO spacecraft and observed in situ by\nMESSENGER, Venus Express, Wind and Mars Express. Based on detected arrivals at\nfour different positions in interplanetary space, it was possible to strongly\nconstrain the kinematics and the shape of the ejection. Using the white-light\nheliospheric imagery from STEREO-A and B, we derived two different kinematical\nprofiles for the CME by applying the novel constrained self-similar expansion\nmethod. In addition, we used a drag-based model to investigate the influence of\nthe ambient solar wind on the CME's propagation. We found that two preceding\nCMEs heading in different directions disturbed the overall shape of the CME and\ninfluenced its propagation behavior. While the Venus-directed segment underwent\na gradual deceleration (from ~2700 km/s at 15 R_sun to ~1500 km/s at 154\nR_sun), the Earth-directed part showed an abrupt retardation below 35 R_sun\n(from ~1700 to ~900 km/s). After that, it was propagating with a quasi-constant\nspeed in the wake of a preceding event. Our results highlight the importance of\nstudies concerning the unequal evolution of CMEs. Forecasting can only be\nimproved if conditions in the solar wind are properly taken into account and if\nattention is also paid to large events preceding the one being studied.",

Moreover, Jupiter has the\nlargest and longest-living known atmospheric vortex, the Great Red Spot (GRS).\nSuch vortices abound in nature, but GRS's size, long-term persistence, and\ntemporal longitudinal oscillations make it unique.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The nature of scientific and technological data collection is evolving\nrapidly: data volumes and rates grow exponentially, with increasing complexity\nand information content, and there has been a transition from static data sets\nto data streams that must be analyzed in real time. Interesting or anomalous\nphenomena must be quickly characterized and followed up with additional\nmeasurements via optimal deployment of limited assets. Modern astronomy\npresents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital\nsynoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray\nbursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially\nhazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning\ntools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy\napplications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a\nscientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the\npotentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the\nscientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.\nSimilar challenge arise in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using\nsensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems. Given the exponential growth\nof data rates, and the time-critical response, we need a fully automated and\nrobust approach. We describe the results obtained to date, and the possible\nfuture developments.",
