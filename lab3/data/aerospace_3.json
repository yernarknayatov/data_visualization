    "abstract": "Abstract:  Maritime surveillance (MS) is crucial for search and rescue operations,\nfishery monitoring, pollution control, law enforcement, migration monitoring,\nand national security policies. Since the early days of seafaring, MS has been\na critical task for providing security in human coexistence. Several\ngenerations of sensors providing detailed maritime information have become\navailable for large offshore areas in real time: maritime radar sensors in the\n1950s and the automatic identification system (AIS) in the 1990s among them.\nHowever, ground-based maritime radars and AIS data do not always provide a\ncomprehensive and seamless coverage of the entire maritime space. Therefore,\nthe exploitation of space-based sensor technologies installed on satellites\norbiting around the Earth, such as satellite AIS data, synthetic aperture\nradar, optical sensors, and global navigation satellite systems reflectometry,\nbecomes crucial for MS and to complement the existing terrestrial technologies.\nIn the first part of this work, we provide an overview of the main available\nspace-based sensors technologies and present the advantages and limitations of\neach technology in the scope of MS. The second part, related to artificial\nintelligence, signal processing and data fusion techniques, is provided in a\ncompanion paper, titled: \"Space-based Global Maritime Surveillance.

While the well-known efficient market hypothesis\nrules out any possibility of accurate prediction of stock prices, there are\nformal propositions in the literature demonstrating accurate modeling of the\npredictive systems that can enable us to predict stock prices with a very high\nlevel of accuracy. In this paper, we present a suite of deep learning-based\nregression models that yields a very high level of accuracy in stock price\nprediction. To build our predictive models, we use the historical stock price\ndata of a well-known company listed in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of\nIndia during the period December 31, 2012 to January 9, 2015. The stock prices\nare recorded at five minutes intervals of time during each working day in a\nweek. Using these extremely granular stock price data, we build four\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and five long- and short-term memory\n(LSTM)-based deep learning models for accurate forecasting of the future stock\nprices. We provide detailed results on the forecasting accuracies of all our\nproposed models based on their execution time and their root mean square error\n(RMSE) values.",

Today, the test pyramid is typically used to\nillustrate that the majority of tests should be performed at the lowest (unit\ntest) level, with fewer integration tests, and even fewer acceptance tests\n(which are the most expensive to produce, and the slowest to execute). Although\nthe value of acceptance tests and integration tests increasingly depends on the\nintegrity of the underlying data, models, and pipelines, software development\nand data management organizations have traditionally been siloed and quality\nassurance practice is not as mature in data operations as it is for software.\nCompanies that close this gap by developing cross-organizational systems will\ncreate new competitive advantage and differentiation.

New methods of\nfabrication including additive manufacturing, have overcome some of these\nchallenges and given rise to an increase in the use of diamond-based implants\nin both soft and hard tissue applications. Therefore, due to the unique\nproperties of diamond, it is being considered as a facilitator of bone growth\nand subsequent tissue integration.

Recent studies in these fields propose these kinds of models to\naddress certain complex real-time decision-making problems in which classic\napproaches do not meet time requirements or fail to obtain optimal solutions.\nWhile the good performance of DRL models has been proved for specific use cases\nor scenarios, most studies do not discuss the compromises and generalizability\nof such models during real operations. In this paper we explore the tradeoffs\nof different elements of DRL models and how they might impact the final\nperformance. To that end, we choose the Frequency Plan Design (FPD) problem in\nthe context of multibeam satellite constellations as our use case and propose a\nDRL model to address it. We identify 6 different core elements that have a\nmajor effect in its performance: the policy, the policy optimizer, the state,\naction, and reward representations, and the training environment. We analyze\ndifferent alternatives for each of these elements and characterize their\neffect. We also use multiple environments to account for different scenarios in\nwhich we vary the dimensionality or make the environment nonstationary. Our\nfindings show that DRL is a potential method to address the FPD problem in real\noperations, especially because of its speed in decision-making. However, no\nsingle DRL model is able to outperform the rest in all scenarios, and the best\napproach for each of the 6 core elements depends on the features of the\noperation environment. While we agree on the potential of DRL to solve future\ncomplex problems in the aerospace industry, we also reflect on the importance\nof designing appropriate models and training procedures, understanding the\napplicability of such models, and reporting the main performance tradeoffs.",

However, the\napplication of antenna arrays remains limited because of their size, cost, and\ncomputational complexity. This study proposes and experimentally validates a\nnovel space-time-polarization domain adaptive processing for a single-element\ndual-polarized antenna (STPAPS) by focusing on the polarization diversity of a\ndual-polarized antenna. The mathematical models of arbitrarily polarized\nsignals received by dual-polarized antenna are derived, and an appropriate\nconstraint matrix for dual-polarized-antenna-based GPS antijam is suggested. To\nreduce the computational complexity of the constraint matrix approach, the\neigenvector constraint design scheme is adopted. The performance of STPAPS is\nquantitively and qualitatively evaluated through experiments as follows. 1) The\ncarrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0) of STPAPS under synthetic jamming is\ndemonstrated to be higher than that of the previous minimum mean squared error\n(MMSE) or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) based dual-polarized\nantenna methods. 2) The strengths and weaknesses of STPAPS are qualitatively\ncompared with those of the previous single-element dual-polarized antenna\nmethods that are not based on the MMSE or MVDR algorithms. 3) The\ncharacteristics of STPAPS (in terms of the directions and polarizations of the\nGPS and jamming signals) are compared with those of the conventional\ntwo-element single-polarized antenna array method, which has the same degree of\nfreedom as that of STPAPS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Renewed interest in Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) - i.e. altitudes below 450\nkm - has led to an increased demand for accurate environment characterisation\nand aerodynamic force prediction. While the former requires knowledge of the\nmechanisms that drive density variations in the thermosphere, the latter also\ndepends on the interactions between the gas-particles in the residual\natmosphere and the surfaces exposed to the flow. The determination of the\naerodynamic coefficients is hindered by the numerous uncertainties that\ncharacterise the physical processes occurring at the exposed surfaces. Several\nmodels have been produced over the last 60 years with the intent of combining\naccuracy with relatively simple implementations. In this paper the most popular\nmodels have been selected and reviewed using as discriminating factors\nrelevance with regards to orbital aerodynamics applications and theoretical\nagreement with gas-beam experimental data. More sophisticated models were\nneglected, since their increased accuracy is generally accompanied by a\nsubstantial increase in computation times which is likely to be unsuitable for\nmost space engineering applications. For the sake of clarity, a distinction was\nintroduced between physical and scattering kernel theory based gas-surface\ninteraction models. The physical model category comprises the Hard Cube model,\nthe Soft Cube model and the Washboard model, while the scattering kernel family\nconsists of the Maxwell model, the Nocilla-Hurlbut-Sherman model and the\nCercignani-Lampis-Lord model. Limits and assets of each model have been\ndiscussed with regards to the context of this paper. Wherever possible,\ncomments have been provided to help the reader to identify possible future\nchallenges for gas-surface interaction science with regards to orbital\naerodynamic applications.",

We propose a novel strategy for the nearly real-time\nFault Detection and Identification (FDI) of a dynamical assembly, and for the\nestimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system. The availability of a\ntimely estimate of the health status of the system will allow for an informed\nadaptive planning of maintenance and a dynamical reconfiguration of the mission\nprofile, reducing operating costs and improving reliability. This work\naddresses the three phases of the prognostic flow - namely (1) signal\nacquisition, (2) Fault Detection and Identification, and (3) Remaining Useful\nLife estimation - and introduces a computationally efficient procedure suitable\nfor real-time, on-board execution. To achieve this goal, we propose to combine\ninformation from physical models of different fidelity with machine learning\ntechniques to obtain efficient representations (surrogate models) suitable for\nnearly real-time applications. Additionally, we propose an importance sampling\nstrategy and a novel approach to model damage propagation for dynamical\nsystems. The methodology is assessed for the FDI and RUL estimation of an\naircraft electromechanical actuator (EMA) for secondary flight controls. The\nresults show that the proposed method allows for a high precision in the\nevaluation of the system RUL, while outperforming common model-based techniques\nin terms of computational time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Detumbling refers to the act of dampening the angular velocity of the\nsatellite. This operation is of paramount importance since it is virtually\nimpossible to nominally perform any other operation without some degree of\nattitude control. Common methods used to detumble satellites usually involve\nmagnetic actuation, paired with different types of sensors which are used to\nprovide angular velocity feedback. This paper presents the adverse effects of\ntime-discretization on the stability of two detumbling algorithms. An extensive\nliterature review revealed that both algorithms achieve absolute stability for\nsystems involving continuous feedback and output. However, the physical\ncomponents involved impose limitations on the maximum frequency of the\nalgorithm, thereby making any such system inconceivable. This asserts the need\nto perform a discrete-time stability analysis, as it is better suited to\nreflect on the actual implementation and dynamics of these algorithms. The\npaper starts with the current theory and views on the stability of these\nalgorithms. The next sections describe the continuous and discrete-time\nstability analysis performed by the team and the conclusions derived from it.\nTheoretical investigation led to the discovery of multiple conditions on\nangular velocity and operating frequencies of the hardware, for which the\nalgorithms were unstable. These results were then verified through various\nsimulations on MATLAB and Python3.6.7. The paper concludes with a discussion on\nthe various instabilities posed by time-discretization and the conditions under\nwhich the detumbling algorithm would be infeasible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Tipping in multistable systems occurs usually by varying the input slightly,\nresulting in the output switching to an often unsatisfactory state. This\nphenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. This thermoacoustic\ninstability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and\naeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression.\nIt was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by\nchanging quickly enough the bifurcation parameters. Thus, in this work, based\non a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored\nnoise, the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is\nderived by using a stochastic averaging method. A transient dynamical behavior\nis identified through a probability density analysis. We find that the rate of\nchange of parameters and the correlation time of the noise are helpful to dodge\nthermoacoustic instability, while a relatively large noise intensity is a\ndisadvantageous factor. In addition, power-law relationships between the\nmaximum amplitude and the noise parameters are explored, and the probability of\nsuccessfully dodging a thermoacoustic instability is calculated. These results\nserve as a guide to the design of engines and to propose an effective control\nstrategy, which is of great significance to aerospace-related fields.",

Greater gains are possible\noutside traditional GNSS orbits and spectrum. GNSS from low Earth orbit (LEO)\nhas long been viewed as promising but expensive, requiring large constellations\nfor rapid navigation solutions. The recent proliferation of commercial\nbroadband constellations offers the possibility of extracting a LEO\npositioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service from existing on-orbit\nhardware. These constellations operate at shorter wavelengths than traditional\nGNSS, permitting highly directive, relatively compact receiver antennas.\nDedicated on-orbit PNT resources are not required: the transmitters, antennas,\nclocks, and spectrum of the hosting broadband network suffice for PNT.\nNon-cooperative use of LEO signals for PNT is an option, but cooperation from\nthe constellation operator (\"fusion\" with its communications mission) eases the\nburden of tracking a dense, low-altitude constellation from the ground, and\nenables a receiver to produce single-epoch stand-alone PNT solutions. This\npaper proposes and analyzes the fused LEO GNSS concept. Viability hinges on\nopportunity cost, or the burden a secondary PNT mission imposes on the\ncommunications constellation operator. An in-depth quantitative opportunity\ncost assessment is provided in terms of time-space-bandwidth product and energy\nbudget.

To infer knowledge from sensors'\nmeasurements, while drawing on a priori knowledge about the vehicle's dynamics,\nmodern approaches solve an optimization problem to compute the most likely\ntrajectory given all past observations, an approach known as smoothing.\nImproving smoothing solvers is an active field of research in the SLAM\ncommunity. Most work is focused on reducing computation load by inverting the\ninvolved linear system while preserving its sparsity. The present paper raises\nan issue which, to the knowledge of the authors, has not been addressed yet:\nstandard smoothing solvers require explicitly using the inverse of sensor noise\ncovariance matrices. This means the parameters that reflect the noise magnitude\nmust be sufficiently large for the smoother to properly function. When matrices\nare close to singular, which is the case when using high precision modern\ninertial measurement units (IMU), numerical issues necessarily arise,\nespecially with 32-bits implementation demanded by most industrial aerospace\napplications. We discuss these issues and propose a solution that builds upon\nthe Kalman filter to improve smoothing algorithms.

However, detecting anomalies in time series data is\nparticularly challenging due to the vague definition of anomalies and said\ndata's frequent lack of labels and highly complex temporal correlations.\nCurrent state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning methods for anomaly\ndetection suffer from scalability and portability issues, and may have high\nfalse positive rates. In this paper, we propose TadGAN, an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection approach built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To capture\nthe temporal correlations of time series distributions, we use LSTM Recurrent\nNeural Networks as base models for Generators and Critics. TadGAN is trained\nwith cycle consistency loss to allow for effective time-series data\nreconstruction. We further propose several novel methods to compute\nreconstruction errors, as well as different approaches to combine\nreconstruction errors and Critic outputs to compute anomaly scores. To\ndemonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach, we test\nseveral anomaly scoring techniques and report the best-suited one. We compare\nour approach to 8 baseline anomaly detection methods on 11 datasets from\nmultiple reputable sources such as NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter.\nThe results show that our approach can effectively detect anomalies and\noutperform baseline methods in most cases (6 out of 11).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Recent successes combine reinforcement learning algorithms and deep neural\nnetworks, despite reinforcement learning not being widely applied to robotics\nand real world scenarios. This can be attributed to the fact that current\nstate-of-the-art, end-to-end reinforcement learning approaches still require\nthousands or millions of data samples to converge to a satisfactory policy and\nare subject to catastrophic failures during training. Conversely, in real world\nscenarios and after just a few data samples, humans are able to either provide\ndemonstrations of the task, intervene to prevent catastrophic actions, or\nsimply evaluate if the policy is performing correctly. This research\ninvestigates how to integrate these human interaction modalities to the\nreinforcement learning loop, increasing sample efficiency and enabling\nreal-time reinforcement learning in robotics and real world scenarios. This\nnovel theoretical foundation is called Cycle-of-Learning, a reference to how\ndifferent human interaction modalities, namely, task demonstration,\nintervention, and evaluation, are cycled and combined to reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. Results presented in this work show that the reward signal that is\nlearned based upon human interaction accelerates the rate of learning of\nreinforcement learning algorithms and that learning from a combination of human\ndemonstrations and interventions is faster and more sample efficient when\ncompared to traditional supervised learning algorithms. Finally,\nCycle-of-Learning develops an effective transition between policies learned\nusing human demonstrations and interventions to reinforcement learning. The\ntheoretical foundation developed by this research opens new research paths to\nhuman-agent teaming scenarios where autonomous agents are able to learn from\nhuman teammates and adapt to mission performance metrics in real-time and in\nreal world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In aerospace engineering and boat building, fluid-structure interaction\nmodels are considered to investigate prototypes before they are physically\nassembled. How a material interacts with different fluids at different Reynold\nnumbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing\nprocess. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids\nbut also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for\nconstruction even better. A possible answer on this demand is\nparameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce\nthe complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent\nfluid-structure interaction discretizations.\nLow-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear\nfluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators\ninvolved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix\nequation. The solution is approximated by a low-rank method. In this paper, we\npropose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear\nparameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the Newton\niteration. The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset,\nthe Newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter\nis computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton step on the whole\nsubset. This Newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be\napproximated by a low-rank method.\nThe resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared\nwith a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate\nproblems consecutively. In the experiments considered, the proposed method\nallowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used\nby the direct approach.",

In our previous work, a general framework to this problem was\nproposed with resolution completeness guarantee. However, a smooth reference\ntrajectory and a low-level safety-critical controller were lacking. In this\nwork, we propose a novel construction of a $C^2$ continuous reference\ntrajectory based on B\u00e9zier curves on $ SO(3) $ that evolves within\npredetermined cells and eliminates previous stop-and-go behavior. Moreover, we\npropose a novel zeroing control barrier function on $ SO(3) $ that provides a\nsafety certificate over a set of overlapping cells on $ SO(3) $ while avoiding\nnonsmooth analysis. The safety certificate is given as a linear constraint on\nthe control input and implemented in real-time. A remedy is proposed to handle\nthe states where the coefficient of the control input in the linear constraint\nvanishes. Numerical simulations are given to verify the advantages of the\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Very low Earth orbits (VLEO), typically classified as orbits below\napproximately 450 km in altitude, have the potential to provide significant\nbenefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude orbits. This\npaper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to\nspacecraft operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which\napply specifically to Earth observation missions. The most significant benefit\nfor optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital altitude improves\nspatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass and\nvolume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly,\nfor radar and lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.\nAdditional benefits include improved geospatial position accuracy, improvements\nin communications link-budgets, and greater launch vehicle insertion\ncapability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment\ncan be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with\nIADC guidelines for spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also\nassisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel\natmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and\norbit control methods.\nHowever, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower\nthermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital\nlifetime whilst minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen\nerosion still require further research. Given the scope for significant\ncommercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised with\nhigher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to\naddress the challenges associated with VLEO operations are required.",

One approach to\nmitigate this issue is to allow an expert to correct the agent's actions during\ntask execution, based on the expert's determination that the agent has reached\na `point of no return.' The agent's policy is then retrained using this new\ncorrective data. This approach alone can enable high-performance agents to be\nlearned, but at a substantial cost: the expert must vigilantly observe\nexecution until the policy reaches a specified level of success, and even at\nthat point, there is no guarantee that the policy will always succeed. To\naddress these limitations, we present FIRE (Failure Identification to Reduce\nExpert Burden in intervention-based learning), a system that can predict when a\nrunning policy will fail, halt its execution, and request a correction from the\nexpert. Unlike existing approaches that learn only from expert data, our\napproach learns from both expert and non-expert data, akin to adversarial\nlearning. We demonstrate experimentally for a series of challenging\nmanipulation tasks that our method is able to recognize state-action pairs that\nlead to failures. This permits seamless integration into an intervention-based\nlearning system, where we show an order-of-magnitude gain in sample efficiency\ncompared with a state-of-the-art inverse reinforcement learning method and\ndramatically improved performance over an equivalent amount of data learned\nwith behavioral cloning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Quantum illumination (QI) promises unprecedented performances in target\ndetection but there are various problems surrounding its implementation. Where\ntarget ranging is a concern, signal and idler recombination forms a crucial\nbarrier to the protocol's success. This could potentially be mitigated if\nperforming a measurement on the idler mode could still yield a quantum\nadvantage. In this paper we investigate the QI protocol for a generically\ncorrelated Gaussian source and study the phase-conjugating (PC) receiver,\nderiving the associated SNR in terms of the signal and idler energies, and\ntheir cross-correlations, which may be readily adapted to incorporate added\nnoise due to Gaussian measurements. We confirm that a heterodyne measurement\nperformed on the idler mode leads to a performance which asymptotically\napproaches that of a coherent state with homodyne detection. However, if the\nsignal mode is affected by heterodyne but the idler mode is maintained clean,\nthe performance asymptotically approaches that of the PC receiver without any\nadded noise.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) is a tool that can produce a reduced\norder model (ROM) from just input-output data of a given system. ERA creates\nthe ROM while keeping the number of internal states to a minimum level. This\nwas first implemented by Juang and Pappa (1984) to analyze the vibration of\naerospace structures from impulse response. We reviewed ERA and tested it on\nsingle input single output (SISO) system as well as on multiple input single\noutput (MISO) system. ERA prediction agreed with the actual data. Unlike other\nmodel reduction techniques (Balanced truncation, balanced proper orthogonal\ndecomposition), ERA works just as fine without the need of the adjoint system,\nthat makes ERA a promising, completely data-driven, thrifty model reduction\nmethod. In this work, we propose a modified Eigensystem Realization Algorithm\nthat relies upon an optimally chosen time resolution for the output used and\nalso checks for good performance through frequency analysis. Four examples are\ndiscussed: the first two confirm the model generating ability and the last two\nillustrate its capability to produce a low-dimensional model (for a large scale\nsystem) that is much more accurate than the one produced by the traditional\nERA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The main focus of the work presented in this thesis is to develop an optimal\ncontrol based formation flying control strategy for high precision formation\nflying of small satellites that have restricted computation and storage\ncapacity. Using the recently developed model predictive static programming\n(MPSP), and Generalized MPSP algorithm a suboptimal guidance logic is presented\nfor the formation flying of small satellites. The proposed guidance scheme is\nvalid both for high eccentricity chief satellite orbits as well as the large\nseparation distance between the chief and deputy satellites. Comparative study\nwith standard Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution (which serves as a\nguess solution for MPSP) and another nonlinear controller, Finite-time\nState-Dependent Ricatti Equation (SDRE) reveals that MPSP guidance achieves the\nobjective with higher accuracy and with a lesser amount of control usage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Combinatorial optimization has found applications in numerous fields, from\naerospace to transportation planning and economics. The goal is to find an\noptimal solution among a finite set of possibilities. The well-known challenge\none faces with combinatorial optimization is the state-space explosion problem:\nthe number of possibilities grows exponentially with the problem size, which\nmakes solving intractable for large problems. In the last years, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has shown its promise for designing good\nheuristics dedicated to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.\nHowever, current approaches have two shortcomings: (1) they mainly focus on the\nstandard travelling salesman problem and they cannot be easily extended to\nother problems, and (2) they only provide an approximate solution with no\nsystematic ways to improve it or to prove optimality. In another context,\nconstraint programming (CP) is a generic tool to solve combinatorial\noptimization problems. Based on a complete search procedure, it will always\nfind the optimal solution if we allow an execution time large enough. A\ncritical design choice, that makes CP non-trivial to use in practice, is the\nbranching decision, directing how the search space is explored. In this work,\nwe propose a general and hybrid approach, based on DRL and CP, for solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems. The core of our approach is based on a\ndynamic programming formulation, that acts as a bridge between both techniques.\nWe experimentally show that our solver is efficient to solve two challenging\nproblems: the traveling salesman problem with time windows, and the 4-moments\nportfolio optimization problem. Results obtained show that the framework\nintroduced outperforms the stand-alone RL and CP solutions, while being\ncompetitive with industrial solvers.",
