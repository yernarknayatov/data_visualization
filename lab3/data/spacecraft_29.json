These models are developed and tuned\nusing data recorded by near-Earth interplanetary spacecraft and by solar\nmagnetograms over the past 53 years. In this paper, we use these\nreconstructions to quantify power input into the magnetosphere over the past\n400 years. For each year, both the annual mean power input is computed and its\ndistribution in daily means. This is possible because the distribution of daily\nvalues divided by the annual mean is shown to maintain the same lognormal form\nwith a constant variance. This study is another important step towards the\ndevelopment of a physics-based, long-term climatology of space weather\nconditions.",

In\nparticular, we focus on the northern volcanic plains (NVP), which correspond to\nthe largest lava flows on Mercury and possibly in the Solar System.\nHigh-temperature viscosity measurements were performed at both superliquidus\n(up to 1736 K) and subliquidus conditions (1569-1502 K) to constrain the\nviscosity variations as a function of crystallinity (from 0 to 28\\%) and shear\nrate (from 0.1 to 5 s 1). Melt viscosity shows moderate variations (4-16 Pa s)\nin the temperature range of 1736-1600 K. Experiments performed below the\nliquidus temperature show an increase in viscosity as shear rate decreases from\n5 to 0.1 s 1, resulting in a shear thinning behavior, with a decrease in\nviscosity of 1 log unit. The low viscosity of the studied composition may\nexplain the ability of NVP lavas to cover long distances, on the order of\nhundreds of kilometers in a turbulent flow regime. Using our experimental data\nwe estimate that lava flows with thickness of 1, 5, and 10 m are likely to have\nvelocities of 4.8, 6.5, and 7.2 m/s, respectively, on a 5 degree ground slope.\nNumerical modeling incorporating both the heat loss of the lavas and its\npossible crystallization during emplacement allows us to infer that high\neffusion rates (>10,000 m3/s) are necessary to cover the large distances\nindicated by satellite data from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,\nGEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft.",

The field is rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been\nobserved for many years. Global maps of the solar magnetic field based on full\ndisk magnetograms are commonly used as boundary conditions for coronal and\nsolar wind models. Two primary observational constraints on the models are (1)\nthe open field regions in the model should approximately correspond to coronal\nholes observed in emission, and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in\nthe model should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In\nthis study, we calculate both MHD and PFSS solutions using fourteen different\nmagnetic maps produced from five different types of observatory magnetograms,\nfor the time period surrounding July, 2010. We have found that for all of the\nmodel/map combinations, models that have coronal hole areas close to\nobservations underestimate the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely,\nfor models to match the interplanetary flux, the modeled open field regions are\nlarger than coronal holes observed in EUV emission. In an alternative approach,\nwe estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by\ncombining automatically detected coronal holes for Carrington rotation 2098\nwith observatory synoptic magnetic maps. This approach also underestimates the\ninterplanetary magnetic flux. Our results imply that either typical observatory\nmaps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux, or a significant portion of the\nopen magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark in EUV and\nX-ray emission.",

In this mission, the DART\nspacecraft is planned to impact the secondary body of Didymos, perturbing\nmutual dynamics of the system. The primary body is currently rotating at a spin\nperiod close to the spin barrier of asteroids, and materials ejected from the\nsecondary due to the DART impact are likely to reach the primary. These\nconditions may cause the primary to reshape, due to landslides, or internal\ndeformation, changing the permanent gravity field.

We use a numerical\nsimulation technique based on the full two-body problem to investigate the\nshape effect on the mutual dynamics in Didymos after the DART impact. The\nresults show that under constant volume, shape deformation induces strong\nperturbation in the mutual motion. We find that the deformation process always\ncauses the orbital period of the system to become shorter. If surface layers\nwith a thickness greater than ~0.4 m on the poles of the primary move down to\nthe equatorial region due to the DART impact, a change in the orbital period of\nthe system and in the spin period of the primary will be detected by\nground-based measurement.",

The \"Thermal\nSupernovas Remnant\" (SNR) Working Group presented a recently published paper on\n1E0102.2-7219 as a calibration standard in the 0.5-1.0 keV band. A new method\nto measure the high-energy spectrum of the Crab Nebula and pulsar with NuSTAR\nwithout using its optics may yield a new absolute flux standard in the 3-7 keV\nband. A new ACIS contamination model - released with CALDB version 4.7.3 -\nleads to a significant improvement in modeling the spectral, spatial, and\ntemporal properties of the contaminant. The first calibration results of the\nscientific payload on board Hitomi confirm the excellent performance of the\ninstruments before the spacecraft operation problems leading to its loss.\nFinally, the meeting discussed extensively a novel statistic approach to\nformally identify in which direction the effective areas of different\ninstruments would need to be changed to bring them into concordance. This\nmethod could inform future further calibration efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian\natmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the\nstatistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure\nperturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as\na discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several\nsurveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil\nstructures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such\nsurveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil\nproperties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with\nthe widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be\ndistorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such\nsurveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure\ntime series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series\ncannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical\nand geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of\nthe duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a\ndistribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the\nunderlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a\nscheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey\nusing data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil\noccurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our\nresults to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five\nlow-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.",

Because of the lack of dedicated exploration missions, our\nknowledge of the composition and atmospheric processes of these distant worlds\nis primarily derived from remote sensing from Earth-based observatories and\nspace telescopes. As a result, Uranus's and Neptune's physical and atmospheric\nproperties remain poorly constrained and their roles in the evolution of the\nSolar System not well understood. Exploration of an ice giant system is\ntherefore a high-priority science objective as these systems (including the\nmagnetosphere, satellites, rings, atmosphere, and interior) challenge our\nunderstanding of planetary formation and evolution. Here we describe the main\nscientific goals to be addressed by a future in situ exploration of an ice\ngiant. An atmospheric entry probe targeting the 10-bar level, about 5 scale\nheights beneath the tropopause, would yield insight into two broad themes: i)\nthe formation history of the ice giants and, in a broader extent, that of the\nSolar System, and ii) the processes at play in planetary atmospheres. The probe\nwould descend under parachute to measure composition, structure, and dynamics,\nwith data returned to Earth using a Carrier Relay Spacecraft as a relay\nstation. In addition, possible mission concepts and partnerships are presented,\nand a strawman ice-giant probe payload is described.

A further application\nto the benchmark study of an analytic solution to the toroidal GS equation with\nadded noise shows deviations in the reconstructed geometry of the flux rope\nconfiguration, characterized by the orientation of the rotation axis, the major\nradius, and the impact parameter. On the other hand, the physical properties of\nthe flux rope, including the axial field strength, and the toroidal and\npoloidal magnetic flux, agree between the numerical and exact GS solutions. We\nalso present a real event study of a magnetic cloud flux rope from \\textit{in\nsitu} spacecraft measurements. The devised procedures for toroidal GS\nreconstruction are successfully executed. Various geometrical and physical\nparameters are obtained with associated uncertainty estimates.

The\nresults show overall consistency, but also discrepancy in that the inclination\nangle of the flux rope central axis with respect to the ecliptic plane differs\nby about 20-30 degrees in the plane of the sky.

A nonlinear distributed observer\nis designed to estimate the leader's states for each follower.

Further, quaternion-based\nhybrid homogeneous controllers recently developed for single spacecraft are\nextended and then applied, by establishing a separation principle with the\nproposed observer, to track the leader's attitude motion. As a result, global\nfinite-time attitude consensus is achieved on the entire attitude manifold,\nwith either full-state measurements or attitude-only measurements, as long as\nthe network topology among the followers is undirected and connected.

However, models of CR propagation are affected by other\nimportant sources of uncertainties, notably from solar modulation and nuclear\nfragmentation, that cannot be improved with the sole use of the AMS data. The\npresent work is aimed at assessing these uncertainties and their relevance in\nthe interpretation of the new AMS data on the boron-to-carbon (B/C) ratio.\nUncertainties from solar modulation are estimated using improved models of CR\ntransport in the Heliosphere constrained against various type of measurements:\nmonthly-resolved CR data collected by balloon-born or space missions,\ninterstellar flux data from the Voyager-1 spacecraft, and counting rates from\nground-based neutron monitor detectors. Uncertainties from nuclear\nfragmentation are estimated using semiempirical cross-section formulae\nconstrained by measurements on isotopically-resolved and charge-changing\nreactions. We found that a proper data-driven treatment of solar modulation can\nguarantee the desired level of precision, in comparison with the improved\naccuracy of the recent data on the B/C ratio. On the other hand, nuclear\nuncertainties represent a serious limiting factor over a wide energy range.

While penitentes have been\nsuggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa (Hobley et al.\n2013), hitherto no penitentes have been identified conclusively on other\nplanetary bodies. Regular ridges with spacing of 3000 m to 5000 m and a depth\nof $\\sim500$ m with morphologies that resemble penitentes (Fig. 1) have been\nobserved by the New Horizons spacecraft (Moore et al. 2016, Stern et al. 2015,\nGladstone et al. 2016, Moore et al. 2017) in the Tartarus Dorsa (TD) region of\nPluto (approximately 220-250$^\\circ$ E, 0-20$^\\circ$ N).

These penitentes deepen by of order 1 cm per orbital cycle in the\npresent era and grow only during periods of relatively high atmospheric\npressure, suggesting a formation timescale of several tens of millions of\nyears, consistent with cratering ages and the current atmospheric loss rate of\nmethane. This time scale, in turn, implies that the penitentes formed from\ninitial topographic variations of no more than a few 10s of meters, consistent\nwith Pluto's youngest terrains.",

The very large area to mass relations needed as a consequence of the low\ninterstellar densities, of the order of 0.1 particles per $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, or\nlower, are potentially realizable with magnetic sails generated by\nsuperconducting coils. Integrating the equations of motion for interstellar\nprotons hitting a Biot Savart loop we evaluate the effective reflection area\n$A(v)$ in terms of the velocity $v$ of the craft. We find that the numerical\ndata is fitted over two orders of magnitude by the scaling relation $A(v)\\ =\\\n0.081A_R\\log^3(I/(\\beta I_c))$, where $A_R=\\pi R^2$ is the bare sail area, $I$\nthe current and $\\beta=v/c$.

The resulting universal deceleration profile can be evaluated\nanalytically and mission parameters optimized for a minimal craft mass.\nFor the case of a sample high speed transit to Proxima Centauri we find that\nmagnetic momentum braking would involve daunting mass requirements of the order\nof $10^3$ tons. A low speed mission to the Trappist-1 system could be realized\non the other side already with a 1.5 ton spacecraft, which would be furthermore\ncompatible with the specifications of currently envisioned directed energy\nlaunch systems. The extended cruising times of the order of $10^4$ years imply\nhowever that a mission to the Trappist-1 system would be viable only for\nmission concepts for which time constrains are not relevant.",

Both\nthe orbit of the spacecraft and the electromagnetic signals themselves are\naffected by the curvature of spacetime. The arrival time of the pulses is\ncompared to the ticks of local clocks to reconstruct the orbital path of the\nsatellite to high accuracy, and to implicitly measure general relativistic\neffects. In particular, Schwarzschild space curvature (static) and\nframe-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's\norbit. The dominant relativistic effect on the path of the signal photons is\nShapiro delay due to static space curvature. We compute these effects for some\ncurrent and proposed space missions, using a Hamiltonian formulation in four\ndimensions. For highly eccentric orbits, such as in the Juno mission and in the\nCassini Grand Finale, the relativistic effects have a kick-like nature, which\ncould be advantageous for detecting them if their signatures are properly\nmodeled as functions of time. Frame-dragging appears, in principle, measurable\nby Juno and Cassini, though not by Galileo 5 and 6. Practical measurement would\nrequire disentangling frame-dragging from the Newtonian 'foreground' such as\nthe gravitational quadrupole which has an impact on both the spacecraft's orbit\nand the signal propagation.

The important findings in this work\ninclude the following: (1) Post-2005, EP reliability has outperformed that of\nchemical propulsion; (2) Hall thrusters have robustly outperformed chemical\npropulsion, and they maintain a small but shrinking reliability advantage over\ngridded ion engines. Other results were also provided, for example the\ndifferentials in MTTA of minor and major anomalies for gridded ion engines and\nHall thrusters.

We gather virtual time profiles\nand perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons with observations,\nassessing longitudinal injection and transport effects as well as peak\nintensities. We distinguish different time profile shapes for well-connected\nand weakly connected observers, and find our onset time analysis to agree with\nthis distinction. At select observers, we identify an additional low-energy\ncomponent of Energetic Storm Particles (ESPs). Using well-connected observers\nfor normalisation, our simulations are able to accurately recreate both time\nprofile shapes and peak intensities at multiple observer locations. This\nsynergetic approach combining numerical modeling with multi-spacecraft\nobservations is crucial for understanding the propagation of SEPs within the\ninterplanetary magnetic field. Our novel analysis provides valuable proof of\nthe ability to simulate SEP propagation throughout the inner heliosphere, at a\nwide range of longitudes.",

In the proposed method, the desired attitude matrix is\ndecomposed into two parts: one is the constant attitude matrix at the very\nstart and the other encodes the attitude changes of the body frame from its\ninitial state. The latter one can be calculated recursively using the gyroscope\noutputs and the constant attitude matrix can be determined using constructed\nvector observations at different time. Compared with traditional initialization\nmethods, the proposed method does not necessitate the spacecraft being static\nor more than two non-collinear vector observations at the same time.

The effectiveness and prospect of the\nproposed method in spacecraft attitude estimation applications have been\nvalidated through numerical simulations.",

We now\napply our framework of interstellar extinction and quantum state calculations\nfor photon encoding to the solar gravitational lens (SGL), which enlarges the\naperture (and thus the photon flux) of the receiving telescope by a factor of\n$>10^9$. For the first time, we show that the use of the SGL for communication\npurposes is possible. This was previously unclear because the Einstein ring is\nplaced inside the solar coronal noise, and contributing factors are difficult\nto determine. We calculate point-spread functions, aperture sizes, heliocentric\ndistance, and optimum communication frequency. The best wavelength for nearby\n(<100 pc) interstellar communication is limited by current technology to the UV\nand optical band. To suppress coronal noise, an advanced coronograph is\nrequired, alternatively an occulter could be used which would require a second\nspacecraft in formation flight 78 km from the receiver, and ~10 m in size. Data\nrates scale approximately linear with the SGL telescope size and with\nheliocentric distance. Achievable (receiving) data rates from Alpha Cen are\n1-10 Mbits per second per Watt for a pair of meter-sized telescopes, an\nimprovement of $10^6$ compared to using the same receiving telescope without\nthe SGL.

In this work, the\nfive-dimensional Fokker-Planck transport equation incorporating perpendicular\ndiffusion is numerically solved to investigate the radial dependence of SEP\npeak intensities. We consider two different scenarios for the distribution of\nspacecraft fleet: (1) along the radial direction line, (2) along the Parker\nmagnetic field line. We find that the index \\alpha in the above expression\nvaries in a wide range, primarily depending on the properties (e.g., location,\ncoverage) of SEP sources and on the longitudinal/latitudinal separations\nbetween the sources and the magnetic footpoints of the observers. Particularly,\nthe situation that whether the magnetic footpoint of the observer is located\ninside or outside of the SEP source is a crucial factor determining the values\nof index \\alpha. A two-phase phenomenon is found in the radial dependence of\npeak intensities. The \"position\" of the breakpoint (transition point/critical\npoint) is determined by the magnetic connection status of the observers. This\nfinding suggests that a very careful examination of magnetic connection between\nSEP source and each spacecraft should be taken in the observational studies. We\nobtain a lower limit of R^{-1.7\\pm0.1} for empirically modelling the radial\ndependence of SEP peak intensities. Our findings in this work can be used to\nexplain the majority of the previous multispacecraft survey results, and\nespecially to reconcile the different/conflicting empirical values of index\n\\alpha in the literature.",

In this work, we numerically explore the\nlong-term evolution, up to $10^5$ yr, of the small moons in a system formed by\nan oblate Saturn and the five largest moons close to the region: Janus,\nEpimetheus, Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. By using frequency analysis we\ndetermined the stability of the small moons and characterize, through diffusion\nmaps, the dynamical behavior of a wide region of geometric phase space, $a$ vs\n$e$, surrounding them. Those maps could shed light on the possible initial\nnumber of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the\ndynamical origin of the small satellites. We found that the four small moons\nare long-term stable and no mark of chaos is found for them. Aegaeon, Methone,\nand Anthe could remain unaltered for at least $\\sim0.5$Myr, given the current\nconfiguration of the system. They remain well-trapped in the corotation\neccentricity resonances with Mimas in which they currently librate. However,\nperturbations from nearby resonances, such as Lindblad eccentricity resonances\nwith Mimas, seem responsible for largest variations observed for Methone and\nAnthe. Pallene remains in a non-resonant orbit and it is the more stable, at\nleast for 64 Myr. Nonetheless, it is affected by a quasi-resonance with Mimas,\nwhich induces long-term orbital oscillations of its eccentricity and\ninclination.",

Understanding the\neffects of reddening and redshift on the observed colors are complicated and\ndependent on the intrinsic spectrum, the filter curves, and the wavelength\ndependence of reddening. We present ultraviolet and optical data of a growing\nsample of SNe Ia observed with the Ultra-Violet/Optical Telescope on the Swift\nspacecraft and use this sample to re-examine the near-UV (NUV) colors of SNe\nIa. We find that a small amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.2 mag) could account for\nthe difference between groups designated as NUV-blue and NUV-red, and a\nmoderate amount of reddening (E(B-V)=0.5 mag) could account for the whole\nNUV-optical differences. The reddening scenario, however, is inconsistent with\nthe mid-UV colors and color evolution. The effect of redshift alone only\naccounts for part of the variation. Using a spectral template of SN2011fe we\ncan forward model the effects of redshift and reddening and directly compare\nwith the observed colors. We find that some SNe are consistent with reddened\nversions of SN2011fe, but most SNe Ia are much redder in the uvw1-v color than\nSN2011fe reddened to the same b-v color. The absolute magnitudes show that two\nof five NUV-blue SNe Ia are blue because their near-UV luminosity is high, and\nthe other three are optically fainter. We also show that SN2011fe is not a\n\"normal\" SN Ia in the UV, but has colors placing it at the blue extreme of our\nsample.",

During the New Horizons flyby of Pluto in\nJuly 2015, the spacecraft probed the composition of Pluto's atmosphere using a\nvariety of observations, including an ultraviolet solar occultation observed by\nthe Alice UV spectrograph (Stern et al. 2015; Gladstone et al. 2016; Young et\nal. 2017).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We develop an approach of Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction for toroidal\nstructures in space plasmas, based on in-situ spacecraft measurements. The\nunderlying theory is the GS equation that describes two-dimensional\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium as widely applied in fusion plasmas. The\ngeometry is such that the arbitrary cross section of the torus has rotational\nsymmetry about the rotation axis $Z$, with a major radius $r_0$. The magnetic\nfield configuration is thus determined by a scalar flux function $\\Psi$ and a\nfunctional $F$ that is a single-variable function of $\\Psi$. The algorithm is\nimplemented through a two-step approach: i) a trial-and-error process by\nminimizing the residue of the functional $F(\\Psi)$ to determine an optimal $Z$\naxis orientation, and ii) for the chosen $Z$, a $\\chi^2$ minimization process\nresulting in the range of $r_0$. Benchmark studies of known analytic solutions\nto the toroidal GS equation with noise additions are presented to illustrate\nthe two-step procedures and to demonstrate the performance of the numerical GS\nsolver, separately. For the cases presented, the errors in $Z$ and $r_0$ are\n9$^\\circ$ and 22\\%, respectively, and the relative percent error in the\nnumerical GS solutions is less than 10\\%. We also make public the computer\ncodes for these implementations and benchmark studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Images of the nucleus and the coma (gas and dust) of comet 67P/Churyumov-\nGerasimenko have been acquired by the OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and\nInfrared Remote Imaging System) cameras since March 2014 using both the Wide\nAngle Camera (WAC) and the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC). We use images from the\nNAC camera to study a bright outburst observed in the southern hemisphere on\nJuly 29, 2015. The high spatial resolution of the NAC is needed to localize the\nsource point of the outburst on the surface of the nucleus. The heliocentric\ndistance is 1.25 au and the spacecraft-comet distance is 186 km. Aiming to\nbetter understand the physics that led to the outgassing, we used the Direct\nSimulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to study the gas flow close to the nucleus\nand the dust trajectories. The goal is to understand the mechanisms producing\nthe outburst. We reproduce the opening angle of the outburst in the model and\nconstrain the outgassing ratio between the outburst source and the local\nregion. The outburst is in fact a combination of both gas and dust, in which\nthe active surface is approximately 10 times more active than the average rate\nfound in the surrounding areas. We need a number of dust particles 7.83\n$\\times$ 10$^{11}$ - 6.90 $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ (radius 1.97 - 185 {\\mu}m), which\ncorresponds to a mass of dust 220 - 21 $\\times$ 10$^{3}$kg.",

However the acquisition of the new\nreliable information on their hard X-ray radiation remains demanded, in\nparticular if the corresponding SC provide additional information, e.g. in\nregard to the flare observations from the directions other than the Sun-Earth\ndirection. In this article we present a catalog of powerful solar flares\nregistered by the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND) device designed in the\nSpace Research Institute (IKI) of Russian Academy of Sciences. HEND is mounted\nonboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft. It worked successfully during the\nflight to Mars and currently operates in the near-Mars orbit. Besides neutrons,\nthe HEND instrument is sensitive to the hard X-ray and gamma radiation. This\nradiation is registered by two scintillators: the outer one is sensitive to the\nphotons above 40 keV and the inner one to the photons above 200 keV. The\ncatalog was created with the new procedure of the data calibration. For most\npowerful 60 solar flares on the visible and on the far sides of the Sun (in\nrespect to a terrestrial observer), we provide time profiles of flare\nradiation, summed over all the channels of X-ray and in some cases of gamma-ray\nbands as well as the spectra and characteristics of their power law\napproximation. We briefly discuss the results of the previous articles on the\nstudy of the Sun with HEND instrument and the potential of the further use of\nthese data.",

A sequence of events started with an M3.5 X-ray class\nflare on 22 August 2015 at 21:19 UTC. The \\textit{\\textit{New-Tupi}} muon\ntelescopes observed a Forbush decrease (FD) triggered by this geomagnetic\nstorm, with onset on 26 August 2015. After the Earth crossed a heliospheric\ncurrent sheet (HCS), an increase in the particle flux was observed on 28 August\n2015 by spacecrafts and ground level detectors. The observed peak was in\ntemporal coincidence with the impact of a high speed stream (HSS). We study\nthis increase, that has been observed with a significance above 1.5\\% by ground\nlevel detectors in different rigidity regimes. We also estimate the lower limit\nof the energy fluence injected on Earth. In addition, we consider the origin of\nthis increase, such as acceleration of particles by shock waves on the front of\nthe HSS and the focusing effect of the HCS crossing. Our results show possible\nevidence of a prolonged energetic (up to GeV energies) particle injection\nwithin the Earth atmosphere system, driven by the HSS. In most cases these\ninjected particles are directed to polar regions. However, the particles from\nthe high energy tail of the spectrum can reach middle latitudes, and that could\nhave consequences for the atmospheric chemistry, for instance, the creation of\nNOx species may be enhanced and can lead to increased ozone depletion. This\ntopic requires further study.",
