    "abstract": "Abstract:  In general relativity, a gravitational wave has two polarization modes\n(tensor mode), but it could have additional polarizations (scalar and vector\nmodes) in the early stage of the universe, where the general relativity may not\nstrictly hold and/or the effect of higher-dimensional gravity may become\nsignificant. In this paper, we discuss how to detect extra-polarization modes\nof stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), and study the separability\nof each polarization using future space-based detectors such as BBO and DECIGO.\nWe specifically consider two plausible setups of the spacecraft constellations\nconsisting of two and four clusters, and estimate the sensitivity to each\npolarization mode of GWBs. We find that a separate detection of each\npolarization mode is rather sensitive to the geometric configuration and\ndistance between clusters and that the clusters should be, in general,\nseparated by an appropriate distance. This seriously degrades the signal\nsensitivity, however, for suitable conditions, space-based detector can\nseparately detect scalar, vector and tensor modes of GWBs with energy density\nas low as ~10^-15.",

The filament, situated in the southern hemisphere, showed\nsinistral chirality consistent with the hemispheric rule. The event was well\nobserved by several observatories in particular by THEMIS. One day before the\ndisappearance, H$\\alpha$ observations showed up and down flows in adjacent\nlocations along the filament, which suggest plasma motions along twisted flux\nrope. THEMIS and GONG observations show shearing photospheric motions leading\nto magnetic flux canceling around barbs. STEREO A, B spacecraft with separation\nangle 52.4 degrees, showed quite different views of this untwisting flux rope\nin He II 304 \u00c5 images. Here, we reconstruct the 3D geometry of the filament\nduring its eruption phase using STEREO EUV He II 304 \u00c5 images and find that\nthe filament was highly inclined to the solar normal. The He II 304 \u00c5 movies\nshow individual threads, which oscillate and rise to an altitude of about 120\nMm with apparent velocities of about 100 km s$^{-1}$, during the rapid\nevolution phase. Finally, as the flux rope expands into the corona, the\nfilament disappears by becoming optically thin to undetectable levels. No CME\nwas detected by STEREO, only a faint CME was recorded by LASCO at the beginning\nof the disappearance phase at 02:00 UT, which could be due to partial filament\neruption.

Physical studies of this object are relevant to this mission, and also\nto understanding its asteroidal or cometary nature. Aims. Our aim is to obtain\nsignificant new constraints on the surface thermal properties of this object.\nMethods. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns)\nobtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results\nfrom the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We\nobtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its\nthermal emission. Results. We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta\n= 1.39 +/- 0.26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3.46 +/-\n0.32 km, and pV = 0.059 +/- 0.011.

We analyze this event using a\nthree-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the solar corona.\nThe numerical simulation is driven and constrained by the observations, and\nindicates where magnetic reconnection occurs between the expanding CME core and\nsurrounding environment. We focus primarily on the lower corona, extending out\nto $3R_{\\odot}$; this range allows simultaneous comparison with both EUVI and\nCOR1 data. Our simulation produces a diffuse coronal bright front remarkably\nsimilar to that observed by STEREO/EUVI at 195 \u00c5. It is made up of \\emph{two}\ncomponents, and is the result of a combination of both wave and non-wave\nmechanisms.\nThe CME becomes large-scale quite low ($<$ 200 Mm) in the corona. It is not,\nhowever, an inherently large-scale event; rather, the expansion is facilitated\nby magnetic reconnection between the expanding CME core and the surrounding\nmagnetic environment. In support of this, we also find numerous secondary\ndimmings, many far from the initial CME source region. Relating such dimmings\nto reconnecting field lines within the simulation provides further evidence\nthat CME expansion leads to the \"opening\" of coronal field lines on a global\nscale. Throughout the CME expansion, the coronal wave maps directly to the CME\nfootprint.\nOur results suggest that the ongoing debate over the \"true\" nature of diffuse\ncoronal waves may be mischaracterized. It appears that \\emph{both} wave and\nnon-wave models are required to explain the observations and understand the\ncomplex nature of these events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Recently a second type of spicules was discovered at the solar limb with the\nSolar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Japanese Hinode spacecraft. These\npreviously unrecognized type II spicules are thin chromospheric jets that are\nshorter-lived (10-60 s) and that show much higher apparent upward velocities\n(of order 50-100 km/s) than the classical spicules. Since they have been\nimplicated in providing hot plasma to coronal loops, their formation, evolution\nand properties are important ingredients for a better understanding of the mass\nand energy balance of the low solar atmosphere. Here we report on the discovery\nof the disk counterparts of type II spicules using spectral imaging data in the\nCa II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter\n(CRISP) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma. We find rapid\nblueward excursions in the line profiles of both chromospheric lines that\ncorrespond to thin, jet-like features that show apparent velocities of order 50\nkm/s. These blueward excursions seem to form a separate absorbing component\nwith Doppler shifts of order 20 and 50 km/s for the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha\nline respectively. We show that the appearance, lifetimes, longitudinal and\ntransverse velocities and occurrence rate of these rapid blue excursions on the\ndisk are very similar to those of the type II spicules at the limb. A detailed\nstudy of the spectral line profiles in these events suggests that plasma is\naccelerated along the jet, and plasma is being heated throughout the short\nlifetime of the event.",

This study is\nbased on a three-dimensional (3-D) magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of\ntwo CMEs observed by SECCHI on January 24-27, 2007. Having a 3-D simulation\nwith synthetic HI images, we are able to compare the two basic methods used to\nderive CME positions from elongation angles, the so-called \"Point-P\" and\n\"Fixed-Phi\" approximations.\nWe confirm, following similar works, that both methods, while valid in the\nmost inner heliosphere, yield increasingly large errors in HI-2 field of view\nfor fast and wide CMEs. Using a simple model of a CME as an expanding\nself-similar sphere, we derive an analytical relationship between elongation\nangles and radial distances for wide CMEs. This relationship is simply the\nharmonic mean of the \"Point-P\" and \"Fixed-Phi'' approximations and it is aimed\nat complementing 3-D fitting of CMEs by cone models or flux rope shapes. It\nproves better at getting the kinematics of the simulated CME right when we\ncompare the results of our line-of-sights to the MHD simulation. Based on this\napproximation, we re-analyze the J-maps (time-elongation maps) in January\n26-27, 2007 and present the first observational evidence that the merging of\nCMEs is associated with a momentum exchange from the faster ejection to the\nslower one due to the propagation of the shock wave associated with the fast\neruption through the slow eruption.",

However, their readouts do not provide a\ndirect measurement of the magnetic field at the positions of the test masses,\nand hence an interpolation method must be designed and implemented to obtain\nthe values of the magnetic field at these positions. However, such\ninterpolation process faces serious difficulties. Indeed, the size of the\ninterpolation region is excessive for a linear interpolation to be reliable\nwhile, on the other hand, the number of magnetometer channels does not provide\nsufficient data to go beyond the linear approximation. We describe an\nalternative method to address this issue, by means of neural network\nalgorithms. The key point in this approach is the ability of neural networks to\nlearn from suitable training data representing the behavior of the magnetic\nfield. Despite the relatively large distance between the test masses and the\nmagnetometers, and the insufficient number of data channels, we find that our\nartificial neural network algorithm is able to reduce the estimation errors of\nthe field and gradient down to levels below 10%, a quite satisfactory result.\nLearning efficiency can be best improved by making use of data obtained in\non-ground measurements prior to mission launch in all relevant satellite\nlocations and in real operation conditions. Reliable information on that\nappears to be essential for a meaningful assessment of magnetic noise in the\nLTP.",

XRFM has been\ndesigned to detect bright X-ray flashes (XRFs) and gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in\nthe 1-20 keV energy band over a wide field of view (4 steradians), thus\nfacilitating the detection of z>6 XRFs/GRBs, which can be further studied by\nother instruments. XRFM would use a coded mask aperture design with hybrid CMOS\nSi detectors. It would be sensitive to XRFs/GRBs with flux in excess of\napproximately 240 mCrab. The spacecraft is designed to rapidly slew to source\npositions following a GRB trigger from XRFM. XRFM instrument design parameters\nand science goals are presented in this paper.",

Our simulations, in agreement with spacecraft\ndata, identify a spectral break in turbulence spectra at characteristic\nlength-scales associated with electromagnetic fluctuations that are smaller\nthan the ion gyroradius. In this regime, our 3D simulations show that turbulent\nspectral cascades in the presence of a mean magnetic field follow an\nomnidirectional anisotropic inertial range spectrum close to $k^{-7/3}$. The\nonset of the spectral break in our simulations can be ascribed to the presence\nof nonlinear Hall interactions that modify the spectral cascades. Our\nsimulations further show that the underlying charachteristic turbulent\nfluctuations are spectrally anisotropic, the extent of which depends critically\non the local wavenumber. The fluctuations associated with length scales smaller\nthan the ion gyroradius are highly compressible and tend to exhibit a near\nequipartition in the velocity and magnetic fields.

The ten\nplumes investigated show a superradial expansion in the coronal hole in 3D\nwhich is consistent with the 2D results. Their deviations from the local\nmeridian planes are rather small with an average of $6.47^{\\circ}$. By\ncomparing the reconstructed plumes with a dipole field with its axis along the\nsolar rotation axis, it is found that plumes are inclined more horizontally\nthan the dipole field. The lower the latitude is, the larger is the deviation\nfrom the dipole field. The relationship between plumes and bright points has\nbeen investigated and they are not always associated. For the first data set,\nbased on the 3D height of plumes and the electron density derived from\nSUMER/\\emph{SOHO} Si {\\sc viii} line pair, we found that electron densities\nalong the plumes decrease with height above the solar surface. The temperature\nobtained from the density scale height is 1.6 to 1.8 times larger than the\ntemperature obtained from Mg {\\sc ix} line ratios.

Furthermore, in the two earlier periods the grain\nimpact direction was in agreement with the flow direction of the interstellar\nhelium while in 2005/2006 we observed a shift in the approach direction of the\ngrains by approximately 30 deg away from the ecliptic plane. The reason for\nthis shift remains unclear but may be connected with the configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field during solar maximum. We also find that the dust\nmeasurements are in agreement with the interplanetary flux model of Staubach et\nal. (1997) which was developed to fit a 5-year span of Ulysses data.",

We present data from the Galileo\ndust instrument for the period January 2000 to September 2003. We report on the\ndata of 5389 particles measured between 2000 and the end of the mission in\n2003. The majority of the 21250 particles for which the full set of measured\nimpact parameters (impact time, impact direction, charge rise times, charge\namplitudes, etc.) was transmitted to Earth were tiny grains (about 10 nm in\nradius), most of them originating from Jupiter's innermost Galilean moon Io.\nTheir impact rates frequently exceeded 10 min^-1. Surprisingly large impact\nrates up to 100 min^-1 occurred in Aug/Sep 2000 when Galileo was at about 280\nR_J from Jupiter. This peak in dust emission appears to coincide with strong\nchanges in the release of neutral gas from the Io torus. Strong variability in\nthe Io dust flux was measured on timescales of days to weeks, indicating large\nvariations in the dust release from Io or the Io torus or both on such short\ntimescales. Galileo has detected a large number of bigger micron-sized\nparticles mostly in the region between the Galilean moons. A surprisingly large\nnumber of such bigger grains was measured in March 2003 within a 4-day interval\nwhen Galileo was outside Jupiter's magnetosphere at approximately 350 R_J\njovicentric distance. Two passages of Jupiter's gossamer rings in 2002 and 2003\nprovided the first actual comparison of in-situ dust data from a planetary ring\nwith the results inferred from inverting optical images.",

Earth-based studies of this object are fundamental to these missions.\nWe present a mid-infrared spectrum (5-38 microns) of 1999 JU3 obtained with\nNASA's Spitzer Space Telescope in May 2008. These observations place new\nconstraints on the surface properties of this asteroid. To fit our spectrum we\nused the near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM) and the more complex\nthermophysical model (TPM). However, the position of the spin-pole, which is\nuncertain, is a crucial input parameter for constraining the thermal inertia\nwith the TPM; hence, we consider two pole orientations. In the extreme case of\nan equatorial retrograde geometry we derive a lower limit to the thermal\ninertia of 150 J/m^2/K/s^0.5. If we adopt the pole orientation of Abe et al.\n(2008a) our best-fit thermal model yields a value for the thermal inertia of\n700+/-200 J/m^2/K/s^0.5 and even higher values are allowed by the uncertainty\nin the spectral shape due to the absolute flux calibration. The lower limit to\nthe thermal inertia, which is unlikely but possible, would be consistent with a\nfine regolith similar to wthat is found for asteroid 433 Eros. However, the\nthermal inertia is expected to be higher, possibly similar to or greater than\nthat on asteroid 25143 Itokawa. Accurately determining the spin-pole of\nasteroid 162173 will narrow the range of possible values for its thermal\ninertia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For the laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) to reach it's design\nsensitivity, the coupling of the free running laser frequency noise to the\nsignal readout must be reduced by more than 14 orders of magnitude. One\ntechnique employed to reduce the laser frequency noise will be arm locking,\nwhere the laser frequency is locked to the LISA arm length. This paper details\nan implementation of arm locking, studies orbital effects, the impact of errors\nin the Doppler knowledge, and noise limits. The noise performance of arm\nlocking is calculated with the inclusion of the dominant expected noise\nsources: ultra stable oscillator (clock) noise, spacecraft motion, and shot\nnoise. Studying these issues reveals that although dual arm locking [A. Sutton\n& D. A Shaddock, Phys. Rev. D 78, 082001 (2008).] has advantages over single\n(or common) arm locking in terms of allowing high gain, it has disadvantages in\nboth laser frequency pulling and noise performance. We address this by\nproposing a hybrid sensor, retaining the benefits of common and dual arm\nlocking sensors. We present a detailed design of an arm locking controller and\nperform an analysis of the expected performance when used with and without\nlaser pre-stabilization. We observe that the sensor phase changes beneficially\nnear unity-gain frequencies of the arm-locking controller, allowing a factor of\n10 more gain than previously believed, without degrading stability. We show\nthat the LISA frequency noise goal can be realized with arm locking and\nTime-Delay Interferometry only, without any form of pre-stabilization.",

The main argument against this hypothesis, namely, the constancy of\nfine-structure and Rydberg constants, is discussed. Both of them being\ncombinations of several physical constants, their constancy imply that, if the\nspeed of light is indeed time-dependent, then at least two other \"fundamental\nconstants\" have to vary as well.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  There are at least four unexplained anomalies connected with astrometric\ndata. Perhaps the most disturbing is the fact that when a spacecraft on a flyby\ntrajectory approaches the Earth within 2000 km or less, it often experiences a\nchange in total orbital energy per unit mass. Next, a secular change in the\nastronomical unit AU is definitely a concern. It is increasing by about 15 cm\nyr$^{-1}$. The other two anomalies are perhaps less disturbing because of known\nsources of nongravitational acceleration. The first is an apparent slowing of\nthe two Pioneer spacecraft as they exit the solar system in opposite\ndirections. Some astronomers and physicists are convinced this effect is of\nconcern, but many others are convinced it is produced by a nearly identical\nthermal emission from both spacecraft, in a direction away from the Sun,\nthereby producing acceleration toward the Sun. The fourth anomaly is a measured\nincrease in the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. Here again, an increase is\nexpected from tidal friction in both the Earth and Moon. However, there is a\nreported unexplained increase that is significant at the three-sigma level. It\nis prudent to suspect that all four anomalies have mundane explanations, or\nthat one or more anomalies are a result of systematic error. Yet they might\neventually be explained by new physics. For example, a slightly modified theory\nof gravitation is not ruled out, perhaps analogous to Einstein's 1916\nexplanation for the excess precession of Mercury's perihelion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Titan is one of the primary scientific objectives of the NASA ESA ASI Cassini\nHuygens mission. Scattering by haze particles in Titan's atmosphere and\nnumerous methane absorptions dramatically veil Titan's surface in the visible\nrange, though it can be studied more easily in some narrow infrared windows.\nThe Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the\nCassini spacecraft successfully imaged its surface in the atmospheric windows,\ntaking hyperspectral images in the range 0.4 5.2 ?m. On 26 October (TA flyby)\nand 13 December 2004 (TB flyby), the Cassini Huygens mission flew over Titan at\nan altitude lower than 1200 km at closest approach. We report here on the\nanalysis of VIMS images of the Huygens landing site acquired at TA and TB, with\na spatial resolution ranging from 16 to14.4 km/pixel. The pure atmospheric\nbackscattering component is corrected by using both an empirical method and a\nfirst-order theoretical model. Both approaches provide consistent results.\nAfter the removal of scattering, ratio images reveal subtle surface\nheterogeneities. A particularly contrasted structure appears in ratio images\ninvolving the 1.59 and 2.03 ?m images north of the Huygens landing site.\nAlthough pure water ice cannot be the only component exposed at Titan's\nsurface, this area is consistent with a local enrichment in exposed water ice\nand seems to be consistent with DISR/Huygens images and spectra\ninterpretations. The images show also a morphological structure that can be\ninterpreted as a 150 km diameter impact crater with a central peak.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  I pinpoint a previously unrecognized MOND effect that may act in the inner\nsolar system, and is due to the galactic acceleration, g_g=eta*a0: a byproduct\nof the MOND external-field effect. Predictions of the effect are not generic to\nthe MOND paradigm, but depend on the particular MOND formulation at hand.\nHowever, the modified-Poisson formulation, on which I concentrate, uniquely\npredicts a subtle anomaly that may be detected in planetary and spacecraft\nmotions (and perhaps in other precision systems, such as binary pulsars),\ndespite their very high accelerations, and even if the MOND interpolating\nfunction is arbitrarily close to unity at high accelerations. Near the sun,\nthis anomaly appears as a quadrupole field, with the acceleration at position u\nfrom the sun being g_i(u)=-q_{ij}u^j, with q_{ij} diagonal, axisymmetric, and\ntraceless: -2q_{xx}=-2q_{yy}=q_{zz}=q(eta)*(a0/R_M), where\nR_M=(MG/a0)^{1/2}=8*10^3 au is the MOND radius of the sun. The anomaly is\ndescribed and analyzed as the Newtonian field of the fictitious cloud of\n``phantom matter'' that hovers around the sun. I find, for the relevant range\nof eta values, and for a range of interpolating functions, mu(x), values of\n10^{-2}<-q< 0.3, which turn out to be sensitive to the form of mu(x) around the\nMOND-to-Newtonian transition. This range verges on the present bounds from\nsolar system measurements. There might thus exist favorable prospects for\neither measuring the effect, or constraining the theory and the relevant\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  It is well known that the Casimir effect is an excellent candidate for the\nstabilization of the extra dimensions. It has also been suggested that the\nCasimir effect in higher dimensions may be the underlying phenomenon that is\nresponsible for the dark energy which is currently driving the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. In this paper we suggest that, in principle, it may\nbe possible to directly manipulate the size of an extra dimension locally using\nStandard Model fields in the next generation of particle accelerators. This\nadjustment of the size of the higher dimension could serve as a technological\nmechanism to locally adjust the dark energy density and change the local\nexpansion of spacetime. This idea holds tantalizing possibilities in the\ncontext of exotic spacecraft propulsion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this paper we present the first comprehensive statistical study of EUV\ncoronal jets observed with the SECCHI imaging suites of the two STEREO\nspacecraft. A catalogue of 79 polar jets is presented, identified from\nsimultaneous EUV and white-light coronagraph observations, taken during the\ntime period March 2007 to April 2008. The appearances of the coronal jets were\nalways correlated with underlying small-scale chromospheric bright points. A\nbasic characterisation of the morphology and identification of the presence of\nhelical structure were established with respect to recently proposed models for\ntheir origin and temporal evolution. A classification of the events with\nrespect to previous jet studies shows that amongst the 79 events there were 37\nEiffel tower-type jet events commonly interpreted as a small-scale (about 35\narcsec) magnetic bipole reconnecting with the ambient unipolar open coronal\nmagnetic fields at its looptops, and 12 lambda-type jet events commonly\ninterpreted as reconnection with the ambient field happening at the bipoles\nfootpoints. Five events were termed micro-CME type jet events because they\nresembled the classical coronal mass ejections (CMEs) but on much smaller\nscales. A few jets are also found in equatorial coronal holes. The typical\nlifetimes in the SECCHI/EUVI (Extreme UltraViolet Imager) field of view between\n1.0 to 1.7 solar radius and in SECCHI/COR1 field of view between 1.4 to 4 solar\nradius are obtained, and the derived speed are roughly estimated. In summary,\nthe observations support the assumption of continuous small-scale reconnection\nas an intrinsic feature of the solar corona, with its role for the heating of\nthe corona, particle acceleration, structuring and acceleration of the solar\nwind remaining to be explored in more details in further studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The interaction of a space system with its orbital environment is a major\nconsideration in the design of any space system, since a variety of hazards are\nassociated with the operation of spacecraft in the harsh space environment. In\nthis brief review, two types of hazards to Earth-orbiting spacecraft are\ndiscussed: spacecraft charging and radiation hazards to spacecraft electronics,\nwith emphasis on the natural environmental factors and interactions which\ncontribute to these hazards. Following a summary of the historical eras of\nspacecraft charging and some observations from experimental satellites: SCATHA,\nCRRES and DMSP, environmental factors significant to spacecraft charging are\ndiscussed, including plasma interactions, electric and magnetic fields and\nsolar radiation. Spacecraft charging depends on the spacecraft geometry, as\nwell as on the characteristics of its orbit, since the natural environment may\ndiffer for each type of orbit. Low altitude orbiting satellites (LEO) usually\nexperience less charging effects than high altitude geosynchronous (GEO)\nsatellites, except for low altitude polar orbiting satellites which cross the\nauroral oval. Basic mechanisms of surface charging, differential charging and\ninternal charging are described. Environmental factors including trapped and\ntransient radiation, solar and galactic cosmic rays, which can profoundly\ndamage spacecraft electronics are presented. Some effects such as ionization\nand atomic displacement damages to semiconductors and single event phenomena\nare also briefly mentioned.",
