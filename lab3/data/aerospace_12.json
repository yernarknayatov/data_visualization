    "abstract": "Abstract:  In multiple time-scale (singularly perturbed) dynamical systems, canards are\ncounterintuitive solutions that evolve along both attracting and repelling\ninvariant manifolds. In two dimensions, canards result in periodic oscillations\nwhose amplitude and period grow in a highly nonlinear way: they are slowly\nvarying with respect to a control parameter, except for an exponentially small\nrange of values where they grow extremely rapidly. This sudden growth, called a\ncanard explosion, has been encountered in many applications ranging from\nchemistry to neuronal dynamics, aerospace engineering and ecology. Canards were\ninitially studied using nonstandard analysis, and later the same results were\nproved by standard techniques such as matched asymptotics, invariant manifold\ntheory and parameter blow-up. More recently, canard-like behaviour has been\nlinked to surfaces of discontinuity in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems. This\npaper provides a new perspective on the canard phenomenon by showing that the\nnonstandard analysis of canard explosions can be recast into the framework of\npiecewise-smooth dynamical systems. An exponential coordinate scaling is\napplied to a singularly perturbed system of ordinary differential equations.\nThe scaling acts as a lens that resolves dynamics across all time-scales. The\nchanges of local curvature that are responsible for canard explosions are then\nanalysed. Regions where different time-scales dominate are separated by\nhypersurfaces, and these are pinched together to obtain a piecewise-smooth\nsystem, in which curvature changes manifest as discontinuity-induced\nbifurcations. The method is used to classify canards in arbitrary dimensions,\nand to derive the parameter values over which canards form either small cycles\n(canards without head) or large cycles (canards with head).",

Object position in an image frame is predicted using the motion\nmodel and a search window, centered at the predicted position is generated.\nObject position is updated with the measurement from object detection. The\ndetected position is sent to the motion controller to move the gimbal so that\nthe object stays at the center of the image frame. Detection and tracking is\nautonomously carried out on the payload computer and the system is able to work\nin two different methods. The first method starts detecting and tracking using\na stored image patch. The second method allows the operator on the ground to\nselect the interest object for the UAV to track. The system is capable of\nre-detecting an object, in the event of tracking failure. Performance of the\ntracking system was verified both in the lab and on the field by mounting the\npayload on a vehicle and simulating a flight.

In the aerospace industry, robot starts to be used\nfor complex applications such as drilling, riveting, fiber placement, NDT, etc.\nGiven the positioning performance of serial robots, precision applications\nrequire usually external measurement device with complexes calibration\nprocedure in order to reach the precision needed. New applications in the\nmachining field of composite material (aerospace, naval, or wind turbine for\nexample) intend to use off line programming of serial robot without the use of\ncalibration or external measurement device. For those applications, the\nposition, orientation and path trajectory precision of the tool center point of\nthe robot are needed to generate the machining operation. This article presents\nthe different conditions that currently limit the development of robots in\nrobotic machining applications. We analyze the dynamical behavior of a robot\nKUKA KR240-2 (located at the University of Bordeaux 1) equipped with a HSM\nSpindle (42000 rpm, 18kW). This analysis is done in three stages. The first\nstep is determining the self-excited frequencies of the robot structure for\nthree different configurations of work.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Alignment of the strapdown inertial navigation system (INS) has strong\nnonlinearity, even worse when maneuvers, e.g., tumbling techniques, are\nemployed to improve the alignment. There is no general rule to attack the\nobservability of a nonlinear system, so most previous works addressed the\nobservability of the corresponding linearized system by implicitly assuming\nthat the original nonlinear system and the linearized one have identical\nobservability characteristics. Strapdown INS alignment is a nonlinear system\nthat has its own characteristics. Using the inherent properties of strapdown\nINS, e.g., the attitude evolution on the SO(3) manifold, we start from the\nbasic definition and develop a global and constructive approach to investigate\nthe observability of strapdown INS static and tumbling alignment, highlighting\nthe effects of the attitude maneuver on observability. We prove that strapdown\nINS alignment, considering the unknown constant sensor biases, will be\ncompletely observable if the strapdown INS is rotated successively about two\ndifferent axes and will be nearly observable for finite known unobservable\nstates (no more than two) if it is rotated about a single axis. Observability\nfrom a global perspective provides us with insights into and a clearer picture\nof the problem, shedding light on previous theoretical results on strapdown INS\nalignment that were not comprehensive or consistent.. The reporting of\ninconsistencies calls for a review of all linearization-based observability\nstudies in the vast literature. Extensive simulations with constructed ideal\nobservers and an extended Kalman filter are carried out, and the numerical\nresults accord with the analysis. The conclusions can also assist in designing\nthe optimal tumbling strategy and the appropriate state observer in practice to\nmaximize the alignment performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Elliptic partial differential equations arise in many fields of science and\nengineering such as steady state distribution of heat, fluid dynamics,\nstructural/mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering and seismology etc. In\nthree dimensions it is well known that the solutions of elliptic boundary value\nproblems have singular behavior near the corners and edges of the domain. The\nsingularities which arise are known as vertex, edge, and vertex-edge\nsingularities. We propose a nonconforming h-p spectral element method to solve\nthree dimensional elliptic boundary value problems on non-smooth domains to\nexponential accuracy. To overcome the singularities which arise in the\nneighbourhoods of the vertices, vertex-edges and edges we use local systems of\ncoordinates. These local coordinates are modified versions of spherical and\ncylindrical coordinate systems in their respective neighbourhoods. Away from\nthese neighbourhoods standard Cartesian coordinates are used. In each of these\nneighbourhoods we use a geometrical mesh which becomes finer near the corners\nand edges. We then derive differentiability estimates in these new set of\nvariables and a stability estimate on which our method is based for a\nnon-conforming h-p spectral element method. The Sobolev spaces in vertex-edge\nand edge neighbourhoods are anisotropic and become singular at the corners and\nedges.\nThe method is essentially a least-squares collocation} method and a solution\ncan be obtained using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method (PCGM). To solve\nthe minimization problem we need to solve the normal equations for the\nleast-squares problem. The residuals in the normal equations can be obtained\nwithout computing and storing mass and stiffness matrices. Computational\nresults for a number of model problems confirm the theoretical estimates\nobtained for the error and computational complexity.",

StackMC is based on the supervised\nlearning techniques of fitting functions and cross validation. It should reduce\nthe variance of any type of Monte Carlo integral estimate (simple sampling,\nimportance sampling, quasi-Monte Carlo, MCMC, etc.) without adding bias. We\nreport on an extensive set of experiments confirming that the StackMC estimate\nof an integral is more accurate than both the associated unprocessed Monte\nCarlo estimate and an estimate based on a functional fit to the MC samples.\nThese experiments run over a wide variety of integration spaces, numbers of\nsample points, dimensions, and fitting functions. In particular, we apply\nStackMC in estimating the expected value of the fuel burn metric of future\ncommercial aircraft and in estimating sonic boom loudness measures.

Cifuolini in 2004 and the NASA-Stanford Gravity Probe-B experiment\nin 2007 confirmed the Lense-Thirring effect as predicted by GR (gravitomagnetic\nfields generated by a rotating massive body, i.e. Earth) within some 10%. In\n2007 gravitomagnetic fields generated by a rotating cryogenic lead disk were\nmeasured by Graham et al. Though these measurements were not conclusive (the\naccuracy of the laser gyrometer was not sufficient to produce a standard\ndeviation small enough) their experiment seems to have seen the same phenomenon\nreported earlier by Tajmar et al., termed parity violation. This means that\ngravitomagnetic fields produced by the cryogenic rotating ring or disk vary\nsubstantially and change sign for clockwise and counter-clockwise directions of\nrotation. The experimental situation therefore occurs to be contradictory. On\nthe one hand GR has been confirmed while at the same time, there seems to be\nexperimental evidence for the existence of extreme gravitomagnetic fields that\ncannot be generated by the movement of large masses. If these experiments can\nbe confirmed, they give a clear indication for the existence of additional\ngravitational fields of non-Newtonian nature. As was shown by the GP-B\nexperiment, measuring gravitomagnetic fields from GR poses extreme\ndifficulties. Therefore a novel physical mechanism should exist for the\ngeneration of gravity-like fields, which might also provide the key to\ngravitational engineering similar to electromagnetic technology.",

Statistical-based STAP\nmethods generally need sufficient statistically independent and identically\ndistributed (IID) training data to estimate the clutter characteristics.\nHowever, most actual clutter scenarios appear only locally stationary and lack\nsufficient IID training data. In this paper, by exploiting the intrinsic\nsparsity of the clutter distribution in the angle-Doppler domain, a new STAP\nalgorithm called SR-STAP is proposed, which uses the technique of sparse\nrecovery to estimate the clutter space-time spectrum. Joint sparse recovery\nwith several training samples is also used to improve the estimation\nperformance. Finally, an effective clutter covariance matrix (CCM) estimate and\nthe corresponding STAP filter are designed based on the estimated clutter\nspectrum. Both the Mountaintop data and simulated experiments have illustrated\nthe fast convergence rate of this approach. Moreover, SR-STAP is less dependent\non prior knowledge, so it is more robust to the mismatch in the prior knowledge\nthan knowledge-based STAP methods. Due to these advantages, SR-STAP has great\npotential for application in actual clutter scenarios.",

Advection, viscous diffusion and chemical reaction appear\nin closed form in the PDF formulation, thus require no closure hypotheses.

The\ngoverning system of equations is solved fully in the Lagrangian framework\nemploying a large number of particles representing a finite sample of all fluid\nparticles.

The main ingredients are a very expressive formal\nlanguage and automatic satisfiability procedures. The language combines\nfirst-order, temporal, and hybrid logic. The satisfiability procedures are\nbased on model checking and satisfiability modulo theory. We applied this\ntechnology within an industrial project to the validation of railways\nrequirements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The property that every control system should posses is stability, which\ntranslates into safety in real-life applications. A central tool in systems\ntheory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting\nclosed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,\npredefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired\nconverging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be\noverconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a\nstability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in\nterms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the\ndesign of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a\ncone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way\nnon-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that\ncan be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to\nclassical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for\nstabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time\ncontrol. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible\nCLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods\nbelow one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive\napplications.",

Model-based specifications of a component-based system permit to\nexplicitly model the structure and behaviour of components and their\nintegration. In particular Software Architectures (SA) has been advocated as an\neffective means to produce quality systems. In this chapter by combining\ndifferent technologies and tools for analysis and development, we propose an\narchitecture-centric model-driven approach to validate required properties and\nto generate the system code. Functional requirements are elicited and used for\nidentifying expected properties the architecture shall express. The\narchitectural compliance to the properties is formally demonstrated, and the\nproduced architectural model is used to automatically generate the Java code.\nSuitable transformations assure that the code is conforming to both structural\nand behavioural SA constraints. This chapter describes the process and\ndiscusses how some existing tools and languages can be exploited to support the\napproach.",

Physical studies of this object are relevant to this mission, and also\nto understanding its asteroidal or cometary nature. Aims. Our aim is to obtain\nsignificant new constraints on the surface thermal properties of this object.\nMethods. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns)\nobtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results\nfrom the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We\nobtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its\nthermal emission. Results. We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta\n= 1.39 +/- 0.26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3.46 +/-\n0.32 km, and pV = 0.059 +/- 0.011. We also obtain similar results when we apply\nthis best-fitting thermal model to single-band mid-IR photometry reported by\nCampins et al. (1995), Kraemer et al. (2005) and Reach et al. (2007).\nConclusions. The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low, consistent with those\nof comet nuclei and primitive C-, P-, D-type asteorids. We establish a rough\nlower limit for the thermal inertia of W-H of 60 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K^-1 when it is\nat r=1AU, which is slightly over the limit of 30 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K-1 derived by\nGroussin et al.

In\nthis model the global dimension is a determinant of a metric of\nthree-dimensional space embedded into an enveloping Lorentizan four-dimensional\nspacetime. In 2012, it has already been presented by the author that this model\ncan be extended to any Lorentzian D + 1-dimensional spacetime, where D is a\ndimension of space, and resulting in the global one-dimensional model of a\nhigher dimensional quantum gravity.\nThe purely quantum-mechanical part of this model is a minimal effective model\nwithin the quantum geometrodynamics, introduced by J.A. Wheeler and B.S. DeWitt\nin the 1960s, but the effective potential is manifestly different from the one\nconsidered by Wheeler & DeWitt. Moreover, in our model the wave functionals\nsolving the quantum gravity are one-variable smooth functions and, therefore,\nthe troublesome mathematical technique of the Feynman functional integration\npresent in the Hawking formulation of quantum gravity, is absent is this model,\nwhat makes it a mathematically consistent theory of quantum gravitation.\nIn this paper, we discuss in some detail a certain part of the global\none-dimensional model already proposed in 2010, and then developed in 2012. The\ngeneralized functional expansion of the effective potential and the residual\napproximation, which describe the embedded spaces which are maximally symmetric\nthree-dimensional Einstein's manifolds, whose lead to the Newton-Coulomb type\npotential in the quantum gravity model, are considered.
