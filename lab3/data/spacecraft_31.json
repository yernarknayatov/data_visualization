    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present an advance towards accurately predicting the arrivals of coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) at the terrestrial planets, including Earth. For the\nfirst time, we are able to assess a CME prediction model using data over 2/3 of\na solar cycle of observations with the Heliophysics System Observatory. We\nvalidate modeling results of 1337 CMEs observed with the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) heliospheric imagers (HI) (science data) from 8\nyears of observations by 5 in situ observing spacecraft. We use the\nself-similar expansion model for CME fronts assuming 60 degree longitudinal\nwidth, constant speed and constant propagation direction. With these\nassumptions we find that 23%-35% of all CMEs that were predicted to hit a\ncertain spacecraft lead to clear in situ signatures, so that for 1 correct\nprediction, 2 to 3 false alarms would have been issued. In addition, we find\nthat the prediction accuracy does not degrade with the HI longitudinal\nseparation from Earth. Predicted arrival times are on average within 2.6 +/-\n16.6 hours difference of the in situ arrival time, similar to analytical and\nnumerical modeling, and a true skill statistic of 0.21. We also discuss various\nfactors that may improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting using\nwide-angle heliospheric imager observations. These results form a first order\napproximated baseline of the prediction accuracy that is possible with HI and\nother methods used for data by an operational space weather mission at the\nSun-Earth L5 point.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have recently shown that both passive and active gravitational masses of a\ncomposite body are not equivalent to its energy due to some quantum effects. We\nhave also suggested an idealized and more realistic experiments to detect the\nabove mentioned inequivalence for a passive gravitational mass. The suggested\nidealized effect is as follows. A spacecraft moves protons of a macroscopic\nensemble of hydrogen atoms with constant velocity in the Earth's gravitational\nfield. Due to non-homogeneous squeezing of space by the field, electron ground\nstate wave function experiences time-dependent perturbation in each hydrogen\natom. This perturbation results in the appearance of a finite probability for\nan electron to be excited at higher energy levels and to emit a photon. The\nexperimental task is to detect such photons from the ensemble of the atoms.\nMore realistic variants of such experiment can be realized in solid crystals\nand nuclei, as first mentioned by us. In his recent Comment on our paper,\nCrowell has argued that the effect, suggested by us, contradicts the existing\nexperiments and, in particular, astronomic data. We show here that this\nconclusion is incorrect and based on the so-called \"free fall\" experiments,\nwhere our effect does not have to be observed.",

The combined observations from these cross-calibrated\ndetectors will allow us to infer the electron anisotropy of individual flares\nconfidently for the first time. We simulated both instrumental and physical\neffects for STIX and MiSolFA including thermal shielding, background and X-ray\nCompton backscattering (albedo effect) in the solar photosphere. We predict the\nexpected number of observable flares available for stereoscopic measurements\nduring the next solar maximum. We also discuss the range of useful spacecraft\nobservation angles for the challenging case of close-to-isotropic flare\nanisotropy. The simulated results show that STIX and MiSolFA will be capable of\ndetecting low levels of flare anisotropy, for M1-class or stronger flares, even\nwith a relatively small spacecraft angular separation of 20-30\u00b0. Both\ninstruments will directly measure the flare X-ray anisotropy of about 40 M- and\nX-class solar flares during the next solar maximum. Near-future stereoscopic\nobservations with Solar Orbiter/STIX and MiSolFA will help distinguishing\nbetween competing flare-acceleration mechanisms, and provide essential\nconstraints regarding collisional and non-collisional transport processes\noccurring in the flaring atmosphere for individual solar flares.",

Titan's atmosphere is favorable for\norganic haze formation, which combined with the presence of some oxygen bearing\nmolecules indicates that Titan's atmosphere may produce molecules of prebiotic\ninterest. The combination of organics and liquid, in the form of water in a\nsubsurface ocean and methane/ethane in the surface lakes and seas, means that\nTitan may be the ideal place in the solar system to test ideas about\nhabitability, prebiotic chemistry, and the ubiquity and diversity of life in\nthe Universe. The Cassini-Huygens mission to the Saturn system has provided a\nwealth of new information allowing for study of Titan as a complex system.

Radio occultations are a common method for\nmeasuring these properties, but they traditionally rely on radio transmissions\nfrom a spacecraft near the planet. Here we explore whether occultations of\nradio emissions from a distant astrophysical radio source can be used to\nmeasure magnetic field strength, plasma density, and neutral density around\nplanets. In a theoretical case study of Jupiter, we find that significant\nchanges in polarization angle due to Faraday rotation occur for radio signals\nthat pass within 10 Jupiter radii of the planet and that significant changes in\nfrequency and power occur from radio signals that pass through the neutral\natmosphere. There are sufficient candidate radio sources, such as pulsars,\nactive galactic nuclei, and masers, that occultations are likely to occur at\nleast once per year. For pulsars, time delays in the arrival of their emitted\npulses can be used to measure plasma density. Exoplanets, whose physical\nproperties are very challenging to observe, may also occult distant\nastrophysical radio sources, such as their parent stars.",

Based on a fully relativistic description\nof the background gravitational physics, we discuss the impact of those\nhighly-precise clocks on the realization of reference frames and time scales\nused in geodesy. We discuss the current definitions of basic geodetic concepts\nand come to the conclusion that the advances in clocks and other metrological\ntechnologies will soon require the re-definition of time scales or, at least,\nclarification to ensure their continuity and consistent use in practice. The\nrelative frequency shift between two clocks is directly related to the\ndifference in the values of the gravity potential at the points of clock's\nlocalization. According to general relativity the relative accuracy of clocks\nin 10$^{-18}$ is equivalent to measuring the gravitational red shift effect\nbetween two clocks with the height difference amounting to 1 cm. We show how\nclock measurements can provide geopotential numbers for the realization of\ngravity-field-related height systems and can resolve discrepancies in\nclassically-determined height systems as well as between national height\nsystems. Another application of clocks is the direct use of observed potential\ndifferences for the improved recovery of regional gravity field solutions.\nFinally, clock measurements for space-borne gravimetry are analyzed along with\nclosely-related deficiencies of this method like an extra-ordinary knowledge of\nthe spacecraft velocity, etc. For all these applications besides the\nnear-future prospects, we also discuss the challenges that are related to using\nthose novel clock data in geodesy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Based on the difference between the orientation of the interstellar $B_{ISM}$\nand the solar magnetic fields, there was an expectation that the magnetic field\ndirection would rotate dramatically across the heliopause (HP). However, the\nVoyager 1 spacecraft measured very little rotation across the HP. Previously we\nshowed that the $B_{ISM}$ twists as it approaches the HP and acquires a strong\nT component (East-West). Here we establish that reconnection in the eastern\nflank of the heliosphere is responsible for the twist. On the eastern flank the\nsolar magnetic field has twisted into the positive N direction and reconnects\nwith the Southward pointing component of the $B_{ISM}$. Reconnection drives a\nrotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction\nand propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The\nconsequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width\nband upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles\n($\\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations\nto support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while\nallowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection\nsuppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\\beta$ (the plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks\nbecause the heliosheath $\\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.\nLarge-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the\nflanks. Simulation data suggest that $B_{ISM}$ will return to its pristine\nvalue $10-15~AU$ past the HP.",

The production of haze in our model is based\non the different steps of aerosol formation as understood on Titan and Triton:\nphotolysis of CH4 in the upper atmosphere by Lyman-alpha UV radiation,\nproduction of various gaseous species, and conversion into solid particles\nthrough accumulation and aggregation processes. We compared two reference\nsimulations ran with a particle radius of 50 nm: with, and without South Pole\nN2 condensation. We discuss the impact of the particle radius and the lifetime\nof the precursors on the haze distribution. We simulate CH4 photolysis and the\nhaze formation up to 600 km above the surface. Results show that CH4 photolysis\nin Pluto's atmosphere in 2015 occured mostly in the sunlit summer hemisphere\nwith a peak at an altitude of 250 km, though the interplanetary source of\nLyman-alpha flux can induce some photolysis even in the Winter hemisphere. We\nobtained an extensive haze up to altitudes comparable with the observations,\nand with non-negligible densities up to 500 km altitude. In both reference\nsimulations, the haze density is not strongly impacted by the meridional\ncirculation. With no South Pole N2 condensation, the maximum nadir opacity and\nhaze extent is obtained at the North Pole. With South Pole N2 condensation, the\ndescending parcel of air above the South Pole leads to a latitudinally more\nhomogeneous haze density with a slight density peak at the South Pole.",

The compression of the sectors is expected to lead to\nreconnection in the heliosheath (HS). We present particle-in-cell simulations\nof the sectored HS that reflect the plasma environment along the Voyager 1 and\n2 trajectories, specifically including unequal positive and negative azimuthal\nmagnetic flux as seen in the Voyager data \\citep{Burlaga03}. Reconnection\nproceeds on individual current sheets until islands on adjacent current layers\nmerge. At late time bands of the dominant flux survive, separated by bands of\ndeep magnetic field depletion. The ambient plasma pressure supports the strong\nmagnetic pressure variation so that pressure is anti-correlated with magnetic\nfield strength. There is little variation in the magnetic field direction\nacross the boundaries of the magnetic depressions. At irregular intervals\nwithin the magnetic depressions are long-lived pairs of magnetic islands where\nthe magnetic field direction reverses so that spacecraft data would reveal\nsharp magnetic field depressions with only occasional crossings with jumps in\nmagnetic field direction. This is typical of the magnetic field data from the\nVoyager spacecraft \\citep{Burlaga11,Burlaga16}. Voyager 2 data reveals that\nfluctuations in the density and magnetic field strength are anti-correlated in\nthe sector zone as expected from reconnection but not in unipolar regions. The\nconsequence of the annihilation of subdominant flux is a sharp reduction in the\n\"number of sectors\" and a loss in magnetic flux as documented from the Voyager\n1 magnetic field and flow data \\citep{Richardson13}.",

We used time sequences near the southeast region from the\nHinode/SOT in Ca II H line obtained on April 3, 2015 and applied the\nde-convolution procedure to the spicule in order to illustrate how effectively\nour restoration method works on fine structures such as spicules. Moreover, the\nintensity oscillations at different heights above the solar limb were analysed\nthrough wavelet transforms. Afterwards, the phase difference was measured among\noscillations at two certain heights in search of evidence for coherent\noscillations. The results of wavelet transformations revealed dominant period\npeaks in 2, 4, 5.5, and 6.5 min at four separate heights. The dominant\nfrequencies for coherency level higher than 75 percent was found to be around\n5.5 and 8.5 mHz. Mean phase speeds of 155-360 km s-1 were measured.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Communication with a spacecraft is typically performed using Radio Frequency\n(RF). RF is a well-established and well-regulated technology that enables\ncommunication over long distances as proven by the Voyager 1 & II missions.\nHowever, RF requires licensing of very limited radio spectrum and this poses a\nchallenge in the future, particularly with spectrum time-sharing. This is of a\nconcern for emergency communication when it is of utmost urgency to contact the\nspacecraft and maintain contact, particularly when there is a major mission\nanomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser\ncommunication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the\nonboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser\nground station to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency.\nAdding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables\ntwo-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser\nbeing located on the spacecraft. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of\nthe concept in the laboratory and develop a benchtop experiment to verify the\nconcept. We have also developed a preliminary design for a 6U CubeSat-based\ndemonstrator to evaluate technology merits",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The remoteness of the Sun and the harsh conditions prevailing in the solar\ncorona have so far limited the observational data used in the study of solar\nphysics to remote-sensing observations taken either from the ground or from\nspace. In contrast, the `solar wind laboratory' is directly measured in situ by\na fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic\nfields at specific points in space. Since 2007, the solar-terrestrial relations\nobservatory (STEREO) has been providing images of the solar wind that flows\nbetween the solar corona and spacecraft making in-situ measurements. This has\nallowed scientists to directly connect processes imaged near the Sun with the\nsubsequent effects measured in the solar wind. This new capability prompted the\ndevelopment of a series of tools and techniques to track heliospheric\nstructures through space. This article presents one of these tools, a web-based\ninterface called the 'Propagation Tool' that offers an integrated research\nenvironment to study the evolution of coronal and solar wind structures, such\nas Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) and\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs). These structures can be propagated from the\nSun outwards to or alternatively inwards from planets and spacecraft situated\nin the inner and outer heliosphere. In this paper, we present the global\narchitecture of the tool, discuss some of the assumptions made to simulate the\nevolution of the structures and show how the tool connects to different\ndatabases.",

Future space\nmissions that can exploit these resources by performing In-Situ Resource\nUtilization (ISRU) gain substantial benefit in terms of range, payload capacity\nand mission flexibility. Compared to the Moon or Mars, the milligravity on some\nasteroids demands a fraction of the energy for digging and accessing hydrated\nregolith just below the surface. However, asteroids and small-bodies, because\nof their low gravity present a major challenge in landing, surface excavation\nand resource capture. These challenges have resulted in adoption of a \"touch\nand go techniques\", like the upcoming Osiris-rex sample-return mission.\nPrevious asteroid excavation efforts have focused on discrete capture events\n(an extension of sampling technology) or whole-asteroid capture and processing.\nThis paper analyzes the control of a bucket-wheel design for asteroid or\nsmall-body excavation. Our study focuses on system design of two counter\nrotating bucket-wheels that are attached to a hovering spacecraft. Regolith is\nexcavated and heated to 1000 C to extract water. The water in turn is\nelectrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. We analyze control\ntechniques to maximize traction of the bucket-wheels on the asteroid surface\nand minimize lift-off the surface, together with methods to dig deeper into the\nasteroid surface. Our studies combine analytical models, with simulation and\nhardware testing. For initial evaluation of material-spacecraft dynamics and\nmechanics, we assume lunar-like regolith for bulk density, particle size and\ncohesion. Our early studies point towards a promising pathway towards\nrefinement of this technology for demonstration aboard a future space mission.",

The onboard Framing Camera has\nacquired thousands of clear filter and narrow band images, which, with the\navailability of high-resolution global shape models, allows for a photometric\ncharacterization of the surface in unprecedented detail. We analyze clear\nfilter images to retrieve the photometric properties of the regolith. In the\nfirst part of the paper we evaluate different photometric models for the global\naverage. In the second part we use these results to study variations in albedo\nand steepness of the phase curve over the surface. Maps of these two\nphotometric parameters show large scale albedo variations, which appear to be\nassociated with compositional differences. They also reveal the location of\nphotometrically extreme terrains, where the phase curve is unusually shallow or\nsteep. We find that shallow phase curves are associated with steep slopes on\ncrater walls and faults, as calculated from a shape model. On the other hand,\nthe phase curve of ejecta associated with young impact craters is steep. We\ninterpret these variations in phase curve slope in terms of physical roughness\nof the regolith. The lack of rough ejecta around older craters suggests that\ninitially rough ejecta associated with impact craters on Vesta are smoothed\nover a relatively short time of several tens of Myr. We propose that this\nprocess is the result of impact gardening, and as such represents a previously\nunrecognized aspect of Vesta space weathering (Pieters et al., 2012). If this\ntype of space weathering is common, we may expect to encounter this photometric\nphenomenon on other main belt asteroids.",

For this, we devise a first-order\ncorrection for in-field stray light, which is known to plague images taken\nthrough the narrow band filters, and revise the flat fields that were acquired\nin an integrating sphere before launch. We used calibrated images of the Vesta\nsurface to construct simple photometric models for all filters, that allow us\nto study how the spectrum changes with increasing phase angle (phase\nreddening). In combination with these models, our calibration method can be\nused to create near-seamless mosaics that are radiometrically accurate to a few\npercent. Such mosaics are provided in JVesta, the Vesta version of the JMARS\ngeographic information system.",

We use here an automated method to identify PMSs\nin 95 CME sheath regions observed in-situ by the Wind and ACE spacecraft\nbetween 1997 and 2015. The occurrence and location of the PMSs are related to\nvarious shock, sheath and CME properties. We find that PMSs are ubiquitous in\nCME sheaths; 85% of the studied sheath regions had PMSs with the mean duration\nof 6.0 hours. In about one-third of the cases the magnetic field vectors\nfollowed a single PMS plane that covered a significant part (at least 67%) of\nthe sheath region. Our analysis gives strong support for two suggested PMS\nformation mechanisms: the amplification and alignment of solar wind\ndiscontinuities near the CME-driven shock and the draping of the magnetic field\nlines around the CME ejecta. For example, we found that the shock and PMS plane\nnormals generally coincided for the events where the PMSs occurred near the\nshock (68% of the PMS plane normals near the shock were separated by less than\n20\u00b0 from the shock normal), while deviations were clearly larger when PMSs\noccurred close to the ejecta leading edge. In addition, PMSs near the shock\nwere generally associated with lower upstream plasma beta than the cases where\nPMSs occurred near the leading edge of the CME. We also demonstrate that the\nplanar parts of the sheath contain a higher amount of strongly southward\nmagnetic field than the non-planar parts, suggesting that planar sheaths are\nmore likely to drive magnetospheric activity.",

One such candidate is the Martian\nmoon Phobos. Because of the limits of current CubeSat hardware and lack of an\naccurate ephemeris of Phobos, there will be a 2 to 5 km uncertainty in distance\nbetween the spacecraft and Phobos. This presents a major GNC challenge when the\nCubeSat first attempts to get into visual range of the moon. One solution to\nthis challenge is to develop optical navigation technology that enables the\nCubeSat to take epicyclic orbits around the most probable location of the\ntarget, autonomously search and home-in on the target body. In worst-case\nscenarios, the technology would narrow down the uncertainty of the small-body\nlocation and then use optical flow, a computer vision algorithm to track\nmovement of objects in the field of view. A dimly lit small-body can be\ndetected by the occlusion of one or more surrounding stars. Our studies present\npreliminary simulations that support the concept.",

The problem of designing an attitude\ncontrol system for CubeSat telescopes is very challenging because current\nchoice of actuators such as reaction-wheels and magnetorquers can induce jitter\non the spacecraft due to moving mechanical parts and due to external\ndisturbances. These telescopes may contain cryo-pumps and servos that introduce\nadditional vibrations. A better solution is required. In our paper, we analyze\nthe feasibility of utilizing solar radiation pressure (SRP) and radiometric\nforce to achieve precise attitude control. Our studies show radiometric\nactuators to be a viable method to achieve precise pointing. The device uses 8\nthin vanes of different temperatures placed in a near-vacuum chamber. These\nchambers contain trace quantities of lightweight, inert gasses like argon. The\ntemperature gradient across the vanes causes the gas molecules to strike the\nvanes differently and thus inducing a force. By controlling these forces, it's\npossible to produce a torque to precisely point or spin a spacecraft. We\npresent a conceptual design of a CubeSat that is equipped with these actuators.\nWe then analyze the potential slew maneuver and slew rates possible with these\nactuators by simulating their performance.

The main conclusion is that\ndust pose much greater threat to the starship than gas atoms. However, analysis\nused to treat interaction of the spaceship with gas atoms is based on the\nincorrect use of the Szenes model. Only by proper treatment of the Szenes model\ncan be found if the conclusion remains valid - or not. In the following, the\nmain comments we have raised about the paper are listed.

The\nmain goal of this work is to shed light on the composition of the Erigone\ncollisional family by means of visible spectroscopy. Asteroid (163) Erigone has\nbeen classified as a primitive object, and we expect the members of this family\nto be consistent with the spectral type of the parent body. We have obtained\nvisible spectra (0.5 to 0.9 microns) for 101 members of the Erigone family,\nusing the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found\nthat 87 percent of the objects have typically primitive visible spectra\nconsistent with that of (163) Erigone. In addition, we found that a significant\nfraction of these objects (approximately 50 percent) present evidence of\naqueous alteration.",

Recently, the\nregolith on asteroid (25143) Itokawa, visited by the JAXA Hayabusa spacecraft,\nwas observed to contain millimeter to centimeter sized particles. Itokawa\nboulders commonly display well-rounded profiles and surface textures that\nappear inconsistent with mechanical fragmentation during meteorite impact; the\nrounded profiles have been hypothesized to arise from rolling and movement on\nthe surface as a consequence of seismic shaking. We provide a possible\nexplanation of these observations by exploring the primary crack propagation\nmechanisms during thermal fatigue of a chondrite. We present the in situ\nevolution of the full-field strains on the surface as a function of temperature\nand microstructure, and observe and quantify the crack growth during thermal\ncycling. We observe that the primary fatigue crack path preferentially follows\nthe interfaces between monominerals, leaving them intact after fragmentation.\nThese observations are explained through a microstructure-based finite element\nmodel that is quantitatively compared with our experimental results. These\nresults on the interactions of thermal fatigue cracking with the microstructure\nmay ultimately allow us to distinguish between thermally induced fragments and\nimpact products.",

Their reduced mass and volume\nhas the potential to translate into significant reductions in required\npropellant and launch mass for interplanetary missions, earth observation and\nfor astrophysics applications. There is an important need to optimize the\ndesign of these spacecraft to better ascertain their maximal capabilities by\nfinding optimized solution, where mass, volume and power is a premium. Current\nspacecraft design methods require a team of experts, who use their engineering\nexperience and judgement to develop a spacecraft design. Such an approach can\nmiss innovative designs not thought of by a human design team. In this work we\npresent a compelling alternative approach that extends the capabilities of a\nspacecraft engineering design team to search for and identify near-optimal\nsolutions using machine learning. The approach enables automated design of a\nspacecraft that requires specifying quantitative goals, requiring reaching a\ntarget location or operating at a predetermined orbit for a required time. Next\na virtual warehouse of components is specified that be selected to produce a\ncandidate design. Candidate designs are produced using an artificial Darwinian\napproach, where fittest design survives and reproduce, while unfit individuals\nare culled off. Our past work in space robotic has produced systems designs and\ncontrollers that are human competitive. Finding a near-optimal solution\npresents vast improvements over a solution obtained through engineering\njudgment and point design alone. The approach shows a credible pathway to\nidentify and evaluate many more candidate designs than it would be otherwise\npossible with a human design team alone.",

For these events, we perform full 3-D\nreconstructions of the CME structure and kinematics, assuming a flux rope\nmorphology for the CME shape, considering the full complement of STEREO and\nSOHO imaging constraints. We find that the flux rope orientations and sizes\ninferred from imaging are not well correlated with MC orientations and sizes\ninferred from the Wind data. However, velocities within the MC region are\nreproduced reasonably well by the image-based reconstruction. Our kinematic\nmeasurements are used to provide simple prescriptions for predicting CME\narrival times at Earth, provided for a range of distances from the Sun where\nCME velocity measurements might be made. Finally, we discuss the differences in\nthe morphology and kinematics of CME flux ropes associated with different\nsurface phenomena (flares, filament eruptions, or no surface activity).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Europlanet 2020 Research Infrastructure will include new Planetary Space\nWeather Services (PSWS) that will extend the concepts of space weather and\nspace situational awareness to other planets in our Solar System and in\nparticular to spacecraft that voyage through it. PSWS will make five entirely\nnew toolkits accessible to the research community and to industrial partners\nplanning for space missions: a general planetary space weather toolkit, as well\nas three toolkits dedicated to the following key planetary environments: Mars,\ncomets, and outer planets. This will give the European planetary science\ncommunity new methods, interfaces, functionalities and/or plugins dedicated to\nplanetary space weather in the tools and models available within the partner\ninstitutes. It will also create a novel event-diary toolkit aiming at\npredicting and detecting planetary events like meteor showers and impacts. A\nvariety of tools are available for tracing propagation of planetary and/or\nsolar events through the Solar System and modelling the response of the\nplanetary environment (surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres)\nto those events. But these tools were not originally designed for planetary\nevent prediction and space weather applications. PSWS will provide the\nadditional research and tailoring required to apply them for these purposes.\nPSWS will be to review, test, improve and adapt methods and tools available\nwithin the partner institutes in order to make prototype planetary event and\nspace weather services operational in Europe at the end of the programme. To\nachieve its objectives PSWS will use a few tools and standards developed for\nthe Astronomy Virtual Observatory (VO).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A recurring topic in interstellar exploration and the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is the role of artificial intelligence.\nMore precisely, these are programs or devices that are capable of performing\ncognitive tasks that have been previously associated with humans such as image\nrecognition, reasoning, decision-making etc. Such systems are likely to play an\nimportant role in future deep space missions, notably interstellar exploration,\nwhere the spacecraft needs to act autonomously. This article explores the\ndrivers for an interstellar mission with a computation-heavy payload and\nprovides an outline of a spacecraft and mission architecture that supports such\na payload. Based on existing technologies and extrapolations of current trends,\nit is shown that AI spacecraft development and operation will be constrained\nand driven by three aspects: power requirements for the payload, power\ngeneration capabilities, and heat rejection capabilities. A likely mission\narchitecture for such a probe is to get into an orbit close to the star in\norder to generate maximum power for computational activities, and then to\nprepare for further exploration activities. Given current levels of increase in\ncomputational power, such a payload with a similar computational power as the\nhuman brain would have a mass of hundreds to dozens of tons in a 2050 - 2060\ntimeframe.",

In this letter, we take\nadvantage of spacecraft Voyager 1's capacity for detecting interstellar CRs\nsince it crossed the heliopause in 2012. This opens up a new avenue to probe DM\nin the sub-GeV energy/mass range that we exploit here for the first time. From\na complete description of the transport of electrons and positrons at low\nenergy, we derive predictions for both the secondary astrophysical background\nand the pair production mechanisms relevant to DM annihilation or decay down to\nthe MeV mass range. Interestingly, we show that reacceleration may push\npositrons up to energies larger than the DM particle mass. We combine the\nconstraints from the Voyager and AMS-02 data to get novel limits covering a\nvery extended DM particle mass range, from MeV to TeV. In the MeV mass range,\nour limits reach annihilation cross sections of order $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle\n\\sim 10^{-28}{\\rm cm^3/s}$. An interesting aspect is that these limits barely\ndepend on the details of cosmic-ray propagation in the weak reacceleration\ncase, a configuration which seems to be favored by the most recent\nboron-to-carbon ($B/C$) data. Though extracted from a completely different and\nnew probe, these bounds have a strength similar to those obtained with the\ncosmic microwave background --- they are even more stringent for $p$-wave\nannihilation.",
