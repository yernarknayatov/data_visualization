    "abstract": "Abstract:  Unsupervised learning of time series data, also known as temporal clustering,\nis a challenging problem in machine learning. Here we propose a novel\nalgorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), to naturally integrate\ndimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end-to-end\nlearning framework, fully unsupervised. The algorithm utilizes an autoencoder\nfor temporal dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for\ncluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the\ndimensionality reduction objec tive. Based on requirement and application, the\ntemporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity\nmetric. Several similarity metrics and state-of-the-art algorithms are\nconsidered and compared. To gain insight into temporal features that the\nnetwork has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that\ngenerates a region of interest heatmap for the time series. The viability of\nthe algorithm is demonstrated using time series data from diverse domains,\nranging from earthquakes to spacecraft sensor data. In each case, we show that\nthe proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods. The superior\nperformance is attributed to the fully integrated temporal dimensionality\nreduction and clustering criterion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents a model based experimental investigation to demonstrate\nthe usefulness of an active damping strategy to manage fluid sloshing motion in\nspacecraft tanks. The active damping strategy is designed to reduce the\ndegrading impact on maneuvering and pointing performance via a force feedback\nstrategy. Many problems have been encountered until now, such as instability of\nthe closed loop system, excessive consumption in the attitude propellant or\nproblems for engine re-ignition in upper stages. Mostly, they have been\naddressed in a passive way via the design of baffles and membranes, which on\ntheir own have mass and constructive impacts. Active management of propellant\nmotion in launchers and satellites has the potential to increase performance on\nvarious levels. This paper demonstrates active slosh management using force\nfeedback for the compensation of the slosh resonances. Force sensors between\ntank and the carrying structure provide information of the fluid motion via the\nreaction force. The control system is designed to generate an appropriate\nacceleration profile that leads to desired attenuation profiles in amplitude,\nfrequency and time. Two robust control design methods, one based on $\\mu$\ndesign and the other on parametric structured design based on non-smooth\noptimization of the worst-case $H_{\\infty}$ norm, are applied. The controller\nis first tested with a computational fluid dynamics simulation in the loop.\nFinally a water tank mounted on a Hexapod with up to $1100$ liter is used to\nevaluate the control performance. The paper illustrates that is possible to\nactively influence sloshing via closed loop.",

Landing on a small asteroid and\nmanipulating its surface materials remains a major unsolved challenge fraught\nwith high risk. The asteroid surface may contain everything from hard boulders\nto soft regolith loosely held by cohesion and very low-gravity.

This limits the contact time and\nrequires fuel expenditure for hovering. An important unknown is the problem of\ngetting stuck or making a hard impact with the surface.

SPIKE will enable contact with the asteroid\nsurface, where it will perform detailed regolith analysis and seismology as\nwell as penetrometry, while keeping the main spacecraft bus at a safe distance.\nUsing one or more long stilts frees the spacecraft from having to hover above\nthe asteroid and thus substantially reduces or eliminates fuel use when doing\nscience operations.

As such, it is\nimportant to assess its performance. We present validation results of the\nWSA-ENLIL+Cone model installed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center\n(CCMC) and executed in real-time by the CCMC space weather team. CCMC uses the\nWSA-ENLIL+Cone model to predict CME arrivals at NASA missions throughout the\ninner heliosphere. In this work we compare model predicted CME arrival-times to\nin-situ ICME leading edge measurements at STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and Earth (Wind\nand ACE) for simulations completed between March 2010-December 2016 (over 1,800\nCMEs). We report hit, miss, false alarm, and correct rejection statistics for\nall three locations. For all predicted CME arrivals, the hit rate is 0.5, and\nthe false alarm rate is 0.1. For the 273 events where the CME was predicted to\narrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually observed (hit event),\nthe mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with a\ntendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours. We show the dependence of the\narrival-time error on CME input parameters. We also explore the impact of the\nmulti-spacecraft observations used to initialize the model CME inputs by\ncomparing model verification results before and after the STEREO-B\ncommunication loss (since September 2014) and STEREO-A sidelobe operations\n(August 2014-December 2015). There is an increase of 1.7 hours in the CME\narrival time error during single, or limited two-viewpoint periods, compared to\nthe three-spacecraft viewpoint period. This trend would apply to a future space\nweather mission at L5 or L4 as another coronagraph viewpoint to reduce CME\narrival time errors compared to a single L1 viewpoint.",

The EUV and HMI observations of\nthe source region show that the associated magnetic flux rope (MFR) axis\npointed to the east before the eruption. We use a nonlinear fore-free field\n(NLFFF) extrapolation to determine the configuration of the coronal magnetic\nfield and calculate the magnetic energy density distributions at different\nheights. The distribution of the magnetic energy density shows a strong\ngradient toward the northeast. The propagation direction of the CME from a\nGraduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) modeling deviates from the radial direction\nof the source region by about 45 degr in longitude and about 30 degr in\nlatitude, which is consistent with the gradient of the magnetic energy\ndistribution around the AR.The MFR axis determined by the GCS modeling points\nsouthward, which has rotated counterclockwise by about 95 degr compared with\nthe orientation of the MFR in the low corona.The MFR reconstructed by a\nGrad-Shafranov (GS) method at 1 AU has almost the same orientation as the MFR\nfrom the GCS modeling, which indicates that the MFR rotation occurred in the\nlow corona. It is the rotation of the MFR that caused the intense geomagnetic\nstorm with the minimum Dst of -155 nT. These results suggest that the coronal\nmagnetic field surrounding the MFR plays a crucial role in the MFR rotation and\npropagation direction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Insights into the processes of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) propagation are\nessential for understanding how solar eruptions affect the radiation\nenvironment of near-Earth space. SEP propagation is influenced by turbulent\nmagnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of SEPs to\nEarth. Multi-spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation\nshapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, modelling SEP cross-field\ntransport as spatial diffusion has been shown to be insufficient without use of\nunrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients. Recent work has shown\nthat the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field\ndirection in turbulent fields is not diffusive, as the particles propagating\nalong meandering field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast\naccess of the particles across the mean field direction, in agreement with the\nSEP observations. In this work, we demonstrate the significance of turbulence\nstrength on evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate\nthe transport parameters with a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the\nSEP parallel scattering mean free path at 1~AU, $\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{*}$, and\nshow that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected, with conditions\nresulting in slow parallel transport corresponding to wider events. We find a\nscaling $\\sigma_{\\phi,\\, \\mathrm{max}}\\propto\n(1/\\lambda_{\\parallel}^{*})^{1/4}$ for the Gaussian fitting of the longitudinal\ndistribution of maximum intensities. The longitudes with highest intensities\nare shifted towards the west for strong scattering conditions. Our results\nemphasise the importance of understanding both the SEP transport and the\ninterplanetary turbulence conditions for modelling and predicting the SEP\nradiation environment at Earth.",

Multiple national and regional consortia have constructed\npulsar timing arrays by precise timing of different sets of millisecond\npulsars. An essential aspect of precision timing is the transfer of the times\nof arrival to a (quasi-)inertial frame, conventionally the solar system\nbarycenter. The barycenter is determined from the knowledge of the planetary\nmasses and orbits, which has been refined over the past 50 years by multiple\nspacecraft. Within the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational\nWaves (NANOGrav), uncertainties on the solar system barycenter are emerging as\nan important element of the NANOGrav noise budget. We describe what is known\nabout the solar system barycenter, touch upon how uncertainties in it affect\ngravitational wave studies with pulsar timing arrays, and consider future\ntrends in spacecraft navigation.",

It can only be seen from time to time, when Cassini, the ring\nand the Sun are arranged in a particular geometric configuration, in very high\nphase angles. Otherwise, it remains \"in the dark\", not visible to Cassini's\ncameras. Through numerical simulations, we found a very short lifetime for the\nring particles, less than a couple of decades. Consequently, the ring needs to\nbe constantly replenished.

This solar\noccultation enabled Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and the\nVisual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) to obtain simultaneous\nmeasurements of the plume's gas and dust components along the same lines of\nsight. The UVIS measurements of the plume's gas content are described in Hansen\net al. (2011, GRL 38:11202) , while this paper describes the VIMS data and the\ninformation they provide about the plume's particle content. Together, the VIMS\nand UVIS measurements reveal that the plume material above Baghdad and Damascus\nsulci has a dust-to-gas mass ratio that is roughly an order of magnitude higher\nthan the material above Alexandria and Cairo sulci. Similar trends in the\nplume's dust-to-gas ratio are also found in data obtained when Cassini flew\nthrough the plume in 2009, during which time the Ion and Neutral Mass\nSpectrometer (INMS), Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS) and Cosmic\nDust Analyzer (CDA) instruments made in-situ measurements of the plume's gas\nand dust densities (Dong et al. 2015 JGR 120:915-937). These and other\npreviously-published systematic differences in the material erupting from\ndifferent fissures likely reflect variations in subsurface conditions across\nEncealdus' South Polar Terrain.",

However, the\nacceleration of near-relativistic electrons by shocks in the interplanetary\nmedium is often questioned. On 9 August 2011 a Corotating Interaction Region\n(CIR) passed STEREO B (STB) that resulted in a flux increase in the electron\nand ion channels of the Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT). Because\nelectron measurements in the few keV to several 100 keV range rely on the\nso-called magnet foil technique, which is utilized by SEPT, ions can contribute\nto the electron channels. Aims. We aim to investigate whether the flux increase\nin the electron channels of SEPT during the CIR event on 9 August 2011 is\ncaused by ion contamination only. Methods. We compute the SEPT response\nfunctions for protons and helium utilizing an updated GEANT4 model of SEPT. The\nCIR energetic particle ion spectra for protons and helium are assumed to follow\na Band function in energy per nucleon with a constant helium to proton ratio.\nResults. Our analysis leads to a helium to proton ratio of 16.9% and a proton\nflux following a Band function with the parameters $I_0 = 1.24 \\cdot 10^4$ /\n(cm2 s sr MeV/nuc.), $E_c = 79$ keV/nuc. and spectral indices of $\\gamma_1 =\n-0.94$ and $\\gamma_2 = -3.80$ which are in good agreement with measurements by\nthe Suprathermal Ion Telescope (SIT) aboard STB. Conclusions. Since our results\nexplain the SEPT measurements, we conclude that no significant amount of\nelectrons were accelerated between $55$ keV and $425$ keV by the CIR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this paper, weak turbulence theory is used to investigate the nonlinear\nevolution of the parametric instability in 3D low-$\\beta$ plasmas at\nwavelengths much greater than the ion inertial length under the assumption that\nslow magnetosonic waves are strongly damped. It is shown analytically that the\nparametric instability leads to an inverse cascade of Alfv\u00e9n wave quanta, and\nseveral exact solutions to the wave kinetic equations are presented. The main\nresults of the paper concern the parametric decay of Alfv\u00e9n waves that\ninitially satisfy $e^+ \\gg e^-$, where $e^+$ and $e^-$ are the frequency\n($\\,f$) spectra of Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating in opposite directions along the\nmagnetic field lines. If $e^+$ initially has a peak frequency $f_0$ (at which\n$f e^+$ is maximized) and an \"infrared\" scaling $f^p$ at smaller $f$ with $-1 <\np < 1$, then $e^+$ acquires an $f^{-1}$ scaling throughout a range of\nfrequencies that spreads out in both directions from $f_0$. At the same time,\n$e^-$ acquires an $f^{-2}$ scaling within this same frequency range. If the\nplasma parameters and infrared $e^+$ spectrum are chosen to match conditions in\nthe fast solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.3 astronomical units (AU),\nthen the nonlinear evolution of the parametric instability leads to an $e^+$\nspectrum that matches fast-wind measurements from the Helios spacecraft at 0.3\nAU, including the observed $f^{-1}$ scaling at $f \\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{-4}\n\\mbox{ Hz}$. The results of this paper suggest that the $f^{-1}$ spectrum seen\nby Helios in the fast solar wind at $f \\gtrsim 3\\times 10^{-4} \\mbox{ Hz}$ is\nproduced in situ by parametric decay and that the $f^{-1}$ range of $e^+$\nextends over an increasingly narrow range of frequencies as $r$ decreases below\n0.3 AU. This prediction will be tested by measurements from the Parker Solar\nProbe.",

Since launch in 2004, the demands put on the\nspacecraft have grown consistently in terms of number and type of targets as\nwell as schedule complexity. To facilitate this growth, various scheduling\ntools and helper technologies have been built by the Swift team to continue\nimproving the scientific yield of the Swift mission.

Because of the computational complexity of the\nscheduling task, no automation tool has been able to produce a plan of equal or\nhigher quality than that produced by a well-trained human, given the necessary\ntime constraints. In this proceeding we formalize the Swift Scheduling Problem\nas a dynamic fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DF-CSP) and explore the\nglobal solution space. We detail here several approaches towards achieving the\ngoal of surpassing human quality schedules using classical optimization and\nalgorithmic techniques, as well as machine learning and recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) methods.

The\nprospects for applications emerged from early discoveries of X-ray source\nclasses and their properties.

The USA experiment\n(1999) was the first flight payload with an explicit X-ray navigation theme.\nSubsequently, NRL has continued to work in this area through participation in\nDARPA and NASA programs. Throughout, the general concept of X-ray navigation\n(XRNAV) has been broad enough to encompass many different uses of X-ray source\nobservations for attitude determination, position determination, and\ntimekeeping. Pulsar-based X-ray navigation (XNAV) is a special case.",

Pulse\nscattering depends strongly on the velocity, shape, orientation, and\ncomposition of the object.

The energy scattered by an object in motion\nmay increase or decrease relative to the energy scattered by the same object at\nrest. Both the magnitude and sign of the change depend on the velocity of the\nobject, as well as on its shape, orientation, and composition.

Here, we\nexplore the prospects for new observations pending from the GAIA spacecraft to\nprovide tests of GR against MOND or TeVes-like theories in a regime only\npartially explored to date. In particular, we find that a histogram of (3D)\nbinary relative velocities against circular velocity predicted from the (2D)\nprojected separations predicts a rather sharp feature in this distribution for\nstandard gravity, with an 80th (90th) percentile value close to 1.025 (1.14)\nwith rather weak dependence on the eccentricity distribution. However,\nMOND/TeVeS theories produce a shifted distribution, with a significant increase\nin these upper percentiles. In MOND-like theories {\\em without} an external\nfield effect, there are large shifts of order unity. With the external field\neffect included, the shifts are considerably reduced to $\\sim 0.04 - 0.08$, but\nare still potentially detectable statistically given reasonably large samples\nand good control of contaminants. In principle, followup of GAIA-selected wide\nbinaries with ground-based radial velocities accurate to < 0.03 km/s should be\nable to produce an interesting new constraint on modified-gravity theories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We identify a dayside electron diffusion region (EDR) encountered by the\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission and estimate the terms in generalized\nOhm's law that controlled energy conversion near the X-point. MMS crossed the\nmoderate-shear (130 degrees) magnetopause southward of the exact X-point. MMS\nlikely entered the magnetopause far from the X-point, outside the EDR, as the\nsize of the reconnection layer was less than but comparable to the\nmagnetosheath proton gyro-radius, and also as anisotropic gyrotropic \"outflow\"\ncrescent electron distributions were observed. MMS then approached the X-point,\nwhere all four spacecraft simultaneously observed signatures of the EDR, e.g.,\nan intense out-of-plane electron current, moderate electron agyrotropy, intense\nelectron anisotropy, non-ideal electric fields, non-ideal energy conversion,\netc. We find that the electric field associated with the non-ideal energy\nconversion is (a) well described by the sum of the electron inertial and\npressure divergence terms in generalized Ohms law though (b) the pressure\ndivergence term dominates the inertial term by roughly a factor of 5:1, (c)\nboth the gyrotropic and agyrotropic pressure forces contribute to energy\nconversion at the X-point, and (d) both out-of-the-reconnection-plane gradients\n(d/dM) and in-plane (d/dL,N) in the pressure tensor contribute to energy\nconversion near the X-point. This indicates that this EDR had some\nelectron-scale structure in the out-of-plane direction during the time when\n(and at the location where) the reconnection site was observed.",

We describe the monitor\nand present measurements which show a gradual 40% increase in count rate\ncoinciding with the declining phase of the solar cycle. Modulations of up to\n10% were also observed with periods of 13 and 26 days that are associated with\nco-rotating interaction regions and heliospheric current sheet crossings. These\nvariations in the flux above the monitor detection threshold (approximately 70\nMeV) are shown to be coherent with measurements made by the IREM monitor\non-board the Earth orbiting INTEGRAL spacecraft. Finally we use the measured\ndeposited energy spectra, in combination with a GEANT4 model, to estimate the\ngalactic cosmic ray differential energy spectrum over the course of the\nmission.",

It is also known that asteroids can represent a threat to our planet.\nSuch important role made space missions to asteroids a very popular topic in\nthe current astrodynamics and astronomy studies. By taking into account the\nincreasingly interest in space missions to asteroids, especially to multiple\nsystems, we present a study aimed to characterize the stable and unstable\nregions around the triple system of asteroids (45) Eugenia. The goal is to\ncharacterize unstable and stable regions of this system and compare with the\nsystem 2001 SN263 - the target of the ASTER mission. Besides, Prado (2014) used\na new concept for mapping orbits considering the disturbance received by the\nspacecraft from all the perturbing forces individually. This method was also\napplied to (45) Eugenia. We present the stable and unstable regions for\nparticles with relative inclination between 0 and 180 degrees. We found that\n(45) Eugenia presents larger stable regions for both, prograde and retrograde\ncases. This is mainly because the satellites of this system are small when\ncompared to the primary body, and because they are not so close to each other.\nWe also present a comparison between those two triple systems, and a discussion\non how these results may guide us in the planning of future missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Since the advent of the space-based photometric missions such as CoRoT and\nNASA's Kepler, asteroseismology has acquired a central role in our\nunderstanding about stellar physics. The Kepler spacecraft, especially, is\nstill releasing excellent photometric observations that contain a large amount\nof information not yet investigated. For exploiting the full potential of these\ndata, sophisticated and robust analysis tools are now essential, so that\nfurther constraining of stellar structure and evolutionary models can be\nobtained. In addition, extracting detailed asteroseismic properties for many\nstars can yield new insights on their correlations to fundamental stellar\nproperties and dynamics. After a brief introduction to the Bayesian notion of\nprobability, I describe the code DIAMONDS for Bayesian parameter estimation and\nmodel comparison by means of the nested sampling Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm.\nNSMC constitutes an efficient and powerful method, in replacement to standard\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo, very suitable for high-dimensional and multimodal\nproblems that are typical of detailed asteroseismic analyses, such as the\nfitting and mode identification of individual oscillation modes in stars (known\nas peak-bagging). DIAMONDS is able to provide robust results for statistical\ninferences involving tens of individual oscillation modes, while at the same\ntime preserving a considerable computational efficiency for identifying the\nsolution. In the tutorial, I will present the fitting of the stellar background\nsignal and the peak-bagging analysis of the oscillation modes in a red-giant\nstar, providing an example to use Bayesian evidence for assessing the peak\nsignificance of the fitted oscillation peaks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The rotation states of small asteroids are affected by a net torque arising\nfrom an anisotropic sunlight reflection and thermal radiation from the\nasteroids' surfaces. On long timescales, this so-called YORP effect can change\nasteroid spin directions and their rotation periods. We analyzed lightcurves of\nfour selected near-Earth asteroids with the aim of detecting secular changes in\ntheir rotation rates that are caused by YORP. We use the lightcurve inversion\nmethod to model the observed lightcurves and include the change in the rotation\nrate $\\mathrm{d} \\omega / \\mathrm{d} t$ as a free parameter of optimization. We\ncollected more than 70 new lightcurves. For asteroids Toro and Cacus, we used\nthermal infrared data from the WISE spacecraft and estimated their size and\nthermal inertia. We also used the currently available optical and radar\nastrometry of Toro, Ra-Shalom, and Cacus to infer the Yarkovsky effect. We\ndetected a YORP acceleration of $\\mathrm{d}\\omega / \\mathrm{d} t = (1.9 \\pm\n0.3) \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-2}$ for asteroid Cacus. For\nToro, we have a tentative ($2\\sigma$) detection of YORP from a significant\nimprovement of the lightcurve fit for a nonzero value of $\\mathrm{d}\\omega /\n\\mathrm{d} t = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-2}$. For asteroid\nEger, we confirmed the previously published YORP detection with more data and\nupdated the YORP value to $(1.1 \\pm 0.5) \\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-2}$. We also updated the shape model of\nasteroid Ra-Shalom and put an upper limit for the change of the rotation rate\nto $|\\mathrm{d}\\omega / \\mathrm{d} t| \\lesssim 1.5 \\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{d}^{-2}$. Ra-Shalom has a greater than $3\\sigma$\nYarkovsky detection with a theoretical value consistent with observations\nassuming its size and/or density is slightly larger than the nominally expected\nvalues.",
