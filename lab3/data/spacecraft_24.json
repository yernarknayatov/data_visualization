The provenance of these regions is uncertain\nyet crucial to understanding the origin of the Martian moon and its interaction\nwith the space environment. Here we show that Phobos' orbital eccentricity can\ncause sufficient grain motion to refresh its surface, suggesting that space\nweathering is the likely driver of the dichotomy on the moon's surface. In\nparticular, we predict that blue regions are made up of pristine endogenic\nmaterial that can be uncovered in steep terrain subject to large variations in\nthe tidal forcing from Mars. The predictions of our model are consistent with\ncurrent spacecraft observations which show that blue units are found near these\nregions.",

CubeSats thanks to their low developmental and\nlaunch costs offer new opportunities for rapidly demonstrating on-orbit\nsurveillance capabilities. In our earlier work, we proposed development of\nSWIMSat (Space based Wide-angle Imaging of Meteors) a 3U CubeSat demonstrator\nthat is designed to observe illuminated objects entering the Earth's\natmosphere. The spacecraft would operate autonomously using a smart camera with\nvision algorithms to detect, track and report of objects. Several CubeSats can\ntrack an object in a coordinated fashion to pinpoint an object's trajectory. An\nextension of this smart camera capability is to track unilluminated objects\nutilizing capabilities we have been developing to track and navigate to Near\nEarth Objects (NEOs). This extension enables detecting and tracking objects\nthat can't readily be detected by humans. The system maintains a dense star map\nof the night sky and performs round the clock observations. Standard optical\nflow algorithms are used to obtain trajectories of all moving objects in the\ncamera field of view. Through a process of elimination, certain stars maybe\noccluded by a transiting unilluminated object which is then used to first\ndetect and obtain a trajectory of the object. Using multiple cameras observing\nthe event from different points of view, it may be possible then to triangulate\nthe position of the object in space and obtain its orbital trajectory. In this\nwork, the performance of our space object detection algorithm coupled with a\nspacecraft guidance, navigation, and control system is demonstrated.",

These abandoned satellites and space debris maybe\neconomically valuable orbital real-estate and resources that can be reused,\nrepaired or upgraded for future use. On-orbit capture and servicing of a\nsatellite requires satellite rendezvous, docking and repair, removal and\nreplacement of components. Launching a big spacecraft that perform satellites\nservicing is one credible approach for servicing and maintaining\nnext-generation constellations. By accessing abandoned satellites and space\ndebris, there is an inherent heightened risk of damage to a servicing\nspacecraft. Under these scenarios, sending multiple, small-robots with each\nrobot specialized in a specific task is a credible alternative, as the system\nis simple and cost-effective and where loss of one or more of robot does not\nend the mission. Eliminating the need for a large spacecraft or positioning the\nlarge spacecraft at safe distance to provide position, navigation and tracking\nsupport simplifies the system and enable the approach to be extensible with the\nlatest ground-based sensing technology.

We compare\nsimultaneous alpha particle, proton beam, and proton core observations from\ninstruments on the Wind spacecraft spanning over 20 years. In nearly\ncollisionless solar wind, we find that the normalized alpha particle drift\nspeed is slower than the normalized proton beam speed; no correlation between\nfluctuations in both species' drifts about their means; and a strong\nanti-correlation between collisional age and alpha-proton differential flow,\nbut no such correlation with proton beam-core differential flow.

In the asymptotic, zero Coulomb collision limit, the\nyoungest measured differential flows most strongly correlate with an\napproximation of the Alfv\u00e9n speed that includes proton pressure anisotropy.\nIn this limit and with this most precise representation, alpha particles drift\nat 67% and proton beam drift is approximately 105% of the local Alfv\u00e9n speed.\nWe posit that one of two physical explanations is possible.

New mid-infrared\nconnections between primitive asteroids and interplanetary dust particles\nindicate that the latter sample a larger fraction of main belt asteroids than\nmeteorites.

Two sample-return missions,\nOSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa 2, will visit primitive near-Earth asteroids (NEAs).\nMost spacecraft-accessible NEAs originate in the inner asteroid belt, which\ncontains several primitive asteroid families and a background of primitive\nasteroids outside these families. Initial results from these families offer a\ntantalizing preview of the properties expected in the NEAs they produce. So\nfar, primitive asteroids in the inner belt fall into two spectral groups. The\nfirst group includes the Polana-Eulalia families, which show considerable\nspectral homogeneity in spite of their dynamical and collisional complexity. In\ncontrast, the Erigone and Sulamitis families are spectrally diverse and most of\ntheir members show clear 0.7 microns hydration features.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Gaia spacecraft has just released a large set of parallaxes, including 41\nnovae for which the fractional error is <30%. I have used these to evaluate the\naccuracy and bias of the many prior methods for getting nova-distances. The\nbest of the prior methods is the geometrical parallaxes from HST for just four\nnovae, although the real error bars are 3X larger than stated. The canonical\nmethod for prior nova-distances has been the expansion parallaxes from the nova\nshells, but this method is found to have real 1-sigma uncertainty of 0.95 mag\nin the distance modulus, and the prior quoted error bars are on average 3.6X\nworse than advertised. The many variations on the\nmaximum-magnitude-rate-of-decline (MMRD) relation are all found to be poor, too\npoor to be useable, and even to be non-applicable for 5-out-of-7 samples of\nnova, so the MMRD should no longer be used. The prior method of using various\nmeasures of the extinction from the interstellar medium have been notoriously\nbad, but now a new version by Ozdonmez and coworkers has improved this to an\nunbiased method with 1-sigma uncertainty of 1.14 mag in the distance modulus.\nFor the future, I recommend in order (1) using the Gaia parallax, (2) using the\ncatalog of Ozdonmez, (3) using M_max = -7.0 +- 1.4 mag as an empirical method\nof poor accuracy, and (4) if none of these methods is available, then to not\nuse the nova for purposes where a distance is needed.",

Moreover, the existence of\ndeformable shock absorbers like Aluminium honeycomb and carbon fibers within\nlanding gears are defeasible for large-scale mass and crewed landing. Further\nin the EDL scenario, switching of events within a limited span of 5 to 8\nminutes appears to be the most challenging task for landers.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The shape of the solar wind bubble within the interstellar medium, the\nso-called heliosphere, has been explored over six decades. As the Sun moves\nthrough the surrounding partially-ionized medium, neutral hydrogen atoms\npenetrate the heliosphere, and through charge-exchange with the supersonic\nsolar wind, create a population of hot pick-up ions (PUIs). The Termination\nShock (TS) crossing by Voyager 2 (V2) data demonstrated that the heliosheath\n(HS) (the region of shocked solar wind) pressure is dominated by suprathermal\nparticles. Here we use a novel magnetohydrodynamic model that treats the\nfreshly ionized PUIs as a separate fluid from the thermal component of the\nsolar wind. Unlike previous models, the new model reproduces the properties of\nthe PUIs and solar wind ions based on the New Horizon and V2 spacecraft\nobservations. The PUIs charge exchange with the cold neutral H atoms of the ISM\nin the HS and are quickly depleted. The depletion of PUIs cools the heliosphere\ndownstream of the TS, \"deflating\" it and leading to a narrower HS and a smaller\nand rounder shape, in agreement with energetic neutral atom observations by the\nCassini spacecraft. The new model, with interstellar magnetic field orientation\nconstrained by the IBEX ribbon, reproduces the magnetic field data outside the\nHP at Voyager 1(V1). We present the predictions for the magnetic field outside\nthe HP at V2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Fireball networks establish the trajectories of meteoritic material passing\nthrough Earth's atmosphere, from which they can derive pre-entry orbits.\nTriangulated atmospheric trajectory data requires different orbit determination\nmethods to those applied to observational data beyond the Earth's\nsphere-of-influence, such as telescopic observations of asteroids. Currently,\nthe vast majority of fireball networks determine and publish orbital data using\nan analytical approach, with little flexibility to include orbital\nperturbations. Here we present a novel numerical technique for determining\nmeteoroid orbits from fireball network data and compare it to previously\nestablished methods. The re-entry of the Hayabusa spacecraft, with its known\npre-Earth orbit, provides a unique opportunity to perform this comparison as it\nwas observed by fireball network cameras. As initial sightings of the Hayabusa\nspacecraft and capsule were made at different altitudes, we are able to\nquantify the atmosphere's influence on the determined pre-Earth orbit.\nConsidering these trajectories independently, we found the orbits determined by\nthe novel numerical approach to align closer to JAXA's telemetry in both cases.\nComparing the orbits determined from the capsule's re-entry shows the need for\nan atmospheric model, which the prevailing analytical approach lacks. Using\nsimulations, we determine the atmospheric perturbation to become significant at\n~90 km; higher than the first observations of typical meteorite dropping\nevents. Using further simulations, we find the most substantial differences\nbetween techniques to occur at both low entry velocities and Moon passing\ntrajectories. These regions of comparative divergence demonstrate the need for\nperturbation inclusion within the chosen orbit determination algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Asteroid mining offers the possibility to revolutionize supply of resources\nvital for human civilization. Preliminary analysis suggests that Near-Earth\nAsteroids (NEA) contain enough volatile and high value minerals to make the\nmining process economically feasible. Considering possible applications,\nspecifically the mining of water in space has become a major focus for\nnear-term options. Most proposed projects for asteroid mining involve\nspacecraft based on traditional designs resulting in large, monolithic and\nexpensive systems.\nAn alternative approach is presented in this paper, basing the asteroid\nmining process on multiple small spacecraft. To the best knowledge of the\nauthors, only limited analysis of the asteroid mining capability of small\nspacecraft has been conducted. This paper explores the possibility to perform\nasteroid mining operations with spacecraft that have a mass under 500 kg and\ndeliver 100 kg of water per trip. The mining process considers water extraction\nthrough microwave heating with an efficiency of 2 Wh/g.The proposed, small\nspacecraft can reach NEAs within a range of $\\sim 0.03$ AU relative to earth's\norbit, offering a delta V of 437 m/s per one-way trip.\nA high-level systems engineering and economic analysis provides a closed\nspacecraft design as a baseline and puts the cost of the proposed spacecraft at\n$ 113.6 million/unit. The results indicate that more than one hundred\nspacecraft and their successful operation for over five years are required to\nachieve a financial break-even point. Pros and cons of using small spacecraft\nswarms are highlighted and the uncertainties associated with cost and profit of\nspace related business ventures are analyzed.",

We describe the evolution of how a magnetospheric\n$\\mathit{B}_{y}$ component is induced on closed field lines during these\nconditions. Starting from dayside lobe reconnection, the magnetic tension on\nnewly reconnected field lines redistribute the open flux asymmetrically between\nthe two hemispheres.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar eruption on 2012 January 27 resulted in a wide-spread solar\nenergetic particle (SEP) event observed by STEREO A and the near-Earth\nspacecraft (separated by 108\\degree). The event was accompanied by an X-class\nflare, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave and fast coronal mass ejection (CME). We\ninvestigate the particle release by comparing the release times of particles at\nthe spacecraft and the times when magnetic connectivity between the source and\nthe spacecraft was established. The EUV wave propagating to the magnetic\nfootpoint of the spacecraft in the lower corona and the shock expanding to the\nopen field line connecting the spacecraft in the upper corona are thought to be\nresponsible for the particle release. We track the evolution of the EUV wave\nand model the propagation of the shock using EUV and white-light observations.\nNo obvious evidence indicates that the EUV wave reached the magnetic footpoint\nof either STEREO A or L1-observers. Our shock modeling shows that the release\ntime of the particles observed at L1 was consistent with the time when the\nshock first established contact with the magnetic field line connecting\nL1-observers. The release of the particles observed by STEREO A was delayed\nrelative to the time when the shock was initially connected to STEREO A via the\nmagnetic field line. We suggest that the particle acceleration efficiency of\nthe portion of the shock connected to the spacecraft determines the release of\nenergetic particles at the spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We investigated 64 pairs of interacting-CME events identified by the\nsimultaneous observations of SOHO and STEREO spacecraft from 2010 January to\n2014 August, to examine the relationship between the large SEP events in the\nenergy of 25-60MeV and the properties of the interacting CMEs. We found that\nduring CME interactions the large SEP events in this study were all generated\nby CMEs with the presence of enhanced type II radio bursts, which also have\nwider longitudinal distributions comparing to events with the absence of type\nII radio burst or its enhancement (almost associated with small SEP events). It\nseems that the signature of type II radio bursts enhancement is a good\ndiscriminator between large SEP and small or none SEP event producers during\nCME interactions. The type II radio burst enhancement is more likely to be\ngenerated by CME interactions, with the main CME having larger speed (v),\nangular width (WD), mass (m) and kinetic energy (E_k), that taking over the\npreceding CMEs which also have higher v, WD, m and E_k, than those preceding\nCMEs in CME pairs missing the type II radio bursts or enhancements. Our\nanalysis also revealed that the intensities of associated SEP events correlate\nnegatively with the intersection height of the two CMEs. Most of\ntype-II-enhanced events and SEP events are coincidentally and almost always\nmade by the fast and wide main CMEs that sweeping fully over a relatively\nslower and narrower preceding CMEs. We suggest that a fast CME with enough\nenergy completely overtaking a relatively narrower preceding CME, especially in\nlow height, can drive more energetic shock signified by the enhanced type II\nradio bursts. The shock may accelerate ambient particles and lead to large SEP\nevent more easily.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Near-Earth asteroid (3200) Phaethon is notable for its association to a\nstrong annual meteor shower, the Geminids, indicative of one or more episodes\nof mass ejection in the past. The mechanism of Phaethon's past activity is not\nyet understood. Here we present a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) search of\nmeter-sized fragments in the vicinity of Phaethon, carried out during\nPhaethon's historic approach to the Earth in mid-December of 2017. Numerical\nsimulation conducted to guide HST's pointing also show that the dynamical\nevolution of Phaethon-originated particles is quick, as ejected materials take\nno longer than $\\sim250$ yr to spread to the entire orbit of Phaethon. Our\nsearch was completed down to 4-meter-class limit (assuming Phaethon-like\nalbedo) and was expected to detect 0.035% particles ejected by Phaethon in the\nlast several decades. The negative result of our search capped the total mass\nloss of Phaethon over the past few dozen orbits to be $10^{12}$ kg at $3\\sigma$\nlevel, taking the best estimates of size power-law from meteor observations and\nspacecraft data. Our result also implies a millimeter-sized dust flux of\n$<10^{-12} \\mathrm{m^{-2} s^{-1}}$ within 0.1 au of Phaethon, suggesting that\nany Phaethon-bound mission is unlikely to encounter dense dust clouds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A multiwavelength campaign was organized to take place between March and July\nof 2012. Excellent temporal coverage was obtained with more than 25\ninstruments, including the MAGIC, FACT and VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes, the\ninstruments on board the Swift and Fermi spacecraft, and the telescopes\noperated by the GASP-WEBT collaboration.\nMrk 501 showed a very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flux above 0.2 TeV of\n$\\sim$0.5 times the Crab Nebula flux (CU) for most of the campaign. The highest\nactivity occurred on 2012 June 9, when the VHE flux was $\\sim$3 CU, and the\npeak of the high-energy spectral component was found to be at $\\sim$2 TeV. This\nstudy reports very hard X-ray spectra, and the hardest VHE spectra measured to\ndate for Mrk 501. The fractional variability was found to increase with energy,\nwith the highest variability occurring at VHE, and a significant correlation\nbetween the X-ray and VHE bands.\nThe unprecedentedly hard X-ray and VHE spectra measured imply that their low-\nand high-energy components peaked above 5 keV and 0.5 TeV, respectively, during\na large fraction of the observing campaign, and hence that Mrk 501 behaved like\nan extreme high-frequency- peaked blazar (EHBL) throughout the 2012 observing\nseason. This suggests that being an EHBL may not be a permanent characteristic\nof a blazar, but rather a state which may change over time. The one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario can successfully describe the segments\nof the SED where most energy is emitted, with a significant correlation between\nthe electron energy density and the VHE gamma-ray activity, suggesting that\nmost of the variability may be explained by the injection of high-energy\nelectrons. The one-zone SSC scenario used reproduces the behaviour seen between\nthe measured X-ray and VHE gamma-ray fluxes, and predicts that the correlation\nbecomes stronger with increasing energy of the X-rays.",

We study the magnetotail electron\ndiffusion region observed by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) on\n2017-07-11 at 22:34 UT and focus on the very large errors in $E_M$ that result\nfrom errors in an $LMN$ boundary-normal coordinate system. We determine several\n$LMN$ coordinates for this MMS event using several different methods. We use\nthese $M$ axes to estimate $E_M$. We find some consensus that the reconnection\nrate was roughly $E_M$=3.2 mV/m $\\pm$ 0.06 mV/m, which corresponds to a\nnormalized reconnection rate of $0.18\\pm0.035$. Minimum variance analysis of\nthe electron velocity (MVA-$v_e$), MVA of $E$, minimization of Faraday residue,\nand an adjusted version of the maximum directional derivative of the magnetic\nfield (MDD-$B$) technique all produce {reasonably} similar coordinate axes. We\nuse virtual MMS data from a particle-in-cell simulation of this event to\nestimate the errors in the coordinate axes and reconnection rate associated\nwith MVA-$v_e$ and MDD-$B$. The $L$ and $M$ directions are most reliably\ndetermined by MVA-$v_e$ when the spacecraft observes a clear electron jet\nreversal. When the magnetic field data has errors as small as 0.5\\% of the\nbackground field strength, the $M$ direction obtained by MDD-$B$ technique may\nbe off by as much as 35$^\\circ$. The normal direction is most accurately\nobtained by MDD-$B$. Overall, we find that these techniques were able to\nidentify $E_M$ from the virtual data within error bars $\\geq$20\\%.",

Here, we\ncombine Langmuir and Mutual Impedance Probe measurements to investigate ion\nvelocities and electron temperatures in the diamagnetic cavity of comet 67P,\nprobed by the Rosetta spacecraft. We find ion velocities generally in the range\n2-4 km/s, significantly above the expected neutral velocity $\\lesssim$1~km/s,\nshowing that the ions are (partially) decoupled from the neutrals, indicating\nthat ion-neutral drag was not responsible for balancing the outside magnetic\npressure. Observations of clear wake effects on one of the Langmuir probes\nshowed that the ion flow was close to radial and supersonic, at least w.r.t.\nthe perpendicular temperature, inside the cavity and possibly in the\nsurrounding region as well. We observed spacecraft potentials $\\lesssim$-5~V\nthroughout the cavity, showing that a population of warm ($\\sim$5~eV) electrons\nwas present throughout the parts of the cavity reached by Rosetta. Also, a\npopulation of cold ($\\lesssim0.1$~eV) electrons was consistently observed\nthroughout the cavity, but less consistently in the surrounding region,\nsuggesting that while Rosetta never entered a region of collisionally coupled\nelectrons, such a region was possibly not far away during the cavity crossings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Much evidence suggests that the solar corona is heated impulsively, meaning\nthat nanoflares may be ubiquitous in quiet and active regions (ARs). Hard X-ray\n(HXR) observations with unprecedented sensitivity $>$3~keV are now enabled by\nfocusing instruments. We analyzed data from the \\textit{Focusing Optics X-ray\nSolar Imager (FOXSI)} rocket and the \\textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope\nArray (NuSTAR)} spacecraft to constrain properties of AR nanoflares simulated\nby the EBTEL field-line-averaged hydrodynamics code. We generated model X-ray\nspectra by computing differential emission measures for homogeneous nanoflare\nsequences with heating amplitudes $H_0$, durations $\\tau$, delay times between\nevents $t_N$, and filling factors $f$. The single quiescent AR observed by\n\\textit{FOXSI-2} on 2014 December 11 is well fit by nanoflare sequences with\nheating amplitudes 0.02 erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ $<$ $H_0$ $<$ 13 erg cm$^{-3}$\ns$^{-1}$ and a wide range of delay times and durations. We exclude delays\nbetween events shorter than $\\sim$900 s at the 90\\% confidence level for this\nregion. Three of five regions observed by {\\nustar} on 2014 November 1 are well\nfit by homogeneous nanoflare models, while two regions with higher fluxes are\nnot. Generally, the {\\nustar} count spectra are well fit by nanoflare sequences\nwith smaller heating amplitudes, shorter delays, and shorter durations than the\nallowed \\textit{FOXSI-2} models. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to\ndifferences in spectral coverage between the two instruments and intrinsic\ndifferences among the regions. Steady heating ($t_N$ = $\\tau$) was ruled out\nwith $>$99\\% confidence for all regions observed by either instrument.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  All known interstellar transportation methods encounter monumental\ntechnological or engineering roadblocks, or even rely on speculative unknown\nscience. In particular light of the recent public excitement and ensuing\ndisappointment regarding the exotic \"EM drive\" it is worthwhile to point out\nthat propellantless space travel is eminently possible based on well\nestablished physical principles. Here a new mode of transport is proposed which\nrelies on electric-field moderated momentum exchange with the ionized particles\nin the interstellar medium. The application of this mechanism faces significant\nchallenges requiring industrial-scale exploitation of space but the\ntechnological roadblocks are different than those presented by light sails or\nparticle beam powered craft, and may be more easily addressed depending on the\nuncertain march of technology. This mode of space travel is well suited to\nenergy efficient travel at velocities less than or of order 0.05c and compares\nexceptionally well to light sails on an energy expenditure basis. It therefore\nrepresents an extremely attractive mode of transport for slow (~multi-century\nlong) voyages carrying massive payloads to nearby stellar neighbors. This would\nbe useful for missions that would otherwise be too energy intensive to carry\nout, such as transporting a generation ship or bulk materials for a future\ncolony around Alpha Cen A.",

Extraterrestrial path\nplanning is challenging due to the combination of terrain roughness and severe\nlimitation in computational resources. Path planning on cluttered and/or uneven\nterrains requires repeated safety checks on all the candidate paths at a small\ninterval. Predicting the future rover state requires simulating the vehicle\nsettling on the terrain, which involves an inverse-kinematics problem with\niterative nonlinear optimization under geometric constraints. However, such\nexpensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as\nRAD750, which is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover.\nWe propose the Approximate Clearance Evaluation (ACE) algorithm, which obtains\nconservative bounds on vehicle clearance, attitude, and suspension angles\nwithout iterative computation. It obtains those bounds by estimating the lowest\nand highest heights that each wheel may reach given the underlying terrain, and\ncalculating the worst-case vehicle configuration associated with those extreme\nwheel heights. The bounds are guaranteed to be conservative, hence ensuring\nvehicle safety during autonomous navigation. ACE is planned to be used as part\nof the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover. This paper describes\nthe algorithm in detail and validates our claim of conservatism and fast\ncomputation through experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On 2018 Feb. 4.41, the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN)\ndiscovered ASASSN-18bt in the K2 Campaign 16 field. With a redshift of\nz=0.01098 and a peak apparent magnitude of B_{max}=14.31, ASASSN-18bt is the\nnearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we\npresent the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and pre-discovery\ndata from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS). The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented 30-minute cadence\nand photometric precision for an SN~Ia light curve, and it unambiguously shows\na ~4 day nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt\njoins a growing list of SNe Ia whose early light curves are not well described\nby a single power law. We show that a double-power-law model fits the data\nreasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for\nthe observed rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with\na non-degenerate companion predict an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain\nthe initial, slower linear phase. Instead, we find that existing, published\nmodels with shallow 56Ni are able to span the observed behavior and, with\ntuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more\ntheoretical work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time\nSNe~Ia light curves. Finally, we use Swift X-ray non-detections to constrain\nthe presence of circumstellar material (CSM) at much larger distances and lower\ndensities than possible with the optical light curve. For a constant density\nCSM these non-detections constrain rho<4.5 * 10^5 cm^-3 at a radius of 4 *10^15\ncm from the progenitor star. Assuming a wind-like environment, we place\nmass-loss limits of Mdot< 8 * 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1 for v_w=100 km s^-1, ruling out\nsome symbiotic progenitor systems.",

Two-way\nILR will provide range data that are about 2 orders of magnitude more accurate\nthan radio-based range data. ILR does not produce Doppler data, however. In\nthis article, we compare the relative strength of radio Doppler and laser range\ndata for the retrieval of parameters of interest in planetary missions, to\nclarify and quantify the science case of ILR, with a focus on geodetic\nobservables.\nWe first provide an overview of the near-term attainable quality of ILR, in\nterms of both the realization of the observable and the models used to process\nthe measurements. Subsequently, we analyze the sensitivity of radio-Doppler and\nlaser-range measurements in representative mission scenarios. We use both an\nanalytical approximation and numerical analyses of the relative sensitivity of\nILR and radio Doppler observables for more general cases.\nWe show that mm-precise range normal points are feasible for ILR, but\nmm-level accuracy and stability is unlikely to be attained, due to a\ncombination of instrumental and model errors. ILR has the potential for\nsuperior performance in observing signatures in the data with a characteristic\nperiod of greater than 0.33-1.65 hours This indicates that Doppler tracking\nwill typically remain the method of choice for gravity field determination and\nspacecraft orbit determination in planetary missions. Laser ranging data,\nhowever, are shown to have a significant advantage for the retrieval of\nrotational and tidal characteristics from landers. Similarly, laser ranging\ndata will be superior for the construction of planetary ephemerides and the\nimprovement of solar system tests of gravitation.",

We complemented the data\nsimulator with a data reduction pipeline capable of performing a rough\nreduction of the simulated data. This pipeline will then be updated once the\nfinal CUTE data reduction pipeline will be fully developed. We further briefly\ndiscuss our plans for the development of a CUTE data reduction pipeline. The\ndata simulator will be used to inform the target selection, improve the\npreliminary signal-to-noise calculator, test the impact on the data of\ndeviations from the nominal instrument characteristics, identify the best\nspacecraft orientation for the observation of each target and construct\nsynthetic data to train the science team in the data analysis prior to launch.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Hot flow anomalies (HFAs) were first discovered in the early 1980s at the bow\nshock of the Earth. In the 1990s these features were studied, observed and\nsimulated very intensively and many new missions focused the attention to this\nphenomenon again. Many basic features and the HFA formation mechanism were\nclarified observationally and using hybrid simulation techniques. We described\nprevious observational, theoretical and simulation results in the research\nfield of HFAs. We introduced HFA observations performed at the Earth, Mars,\nVenus and Saturn in this paper. We share different observation results of space\nmission to give an overview to the reader. Cluster multi-spacecraft\nmeasurements gave us more observed HFA events and finer, more sophisticated\nmethods to understand them better. In this study, HFAs were studied using\nobservations of the Cluster magnetometer and the Cluster plasma detector aboard\nthe four Cluster spacecraft. Energetic particle measurements (28.2-68.9 keV)\nwere also used to detect and select HFAs. We studied several specific features\nof tangential discontinuities generating HFAs on the basis of Cluster\nmeasurements in the period February-April 2003, December 2005-April 2006 and\nJanuary-April, 2007, when the separation of spacecraft was large and the\nCluster fleet reached the bow shock. We have confirmed the condition for\nforming HFAs, that the solar wind speed is higher than the average. This\ncondition was also confirmed by simultaneous ACE magnetic field and solar wind\nplasma observations at the L1 point 1.4 million km upstream of the Earth. The\nmeasured and calculated features of HFA events were compared with the results\nof different previous hybrid simulations. During the whole spring season of\n2003, the solar wind speed was higher than the average. Here we checked whether\nthe higher solar wind speed is a real condition of HFA formation also in 2006\nand 2007.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The recent growing trend to develop large-scale satellite constellations\n(i.e., mega-constellation) with low-cost small satellites has brought the need\nfor an efficient and scalable maintenance strategy decision plan. Traditional\nspare strategies for satellite constellations cannot handle these\nmega-constellations due to their limited scalability in number of satellites\nand/or frequency of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel spare strategy\nusing an inventory management approach. We consider a set of parking orbits at\na lower altitude than the constellation for spare storage, and model satellite\nconstellation spare strategy problem using a multi-echelon (s,Q)-type inventory\npolicy, viewing Earth's ground as a supplier, parking orbits as warehouses, and\nin-plane spare stocks as retailers. This inventory model is unique in that the\nparking orbits (warehouses) drift away from the orbital planes over time due to\norbital mechanics' effects, and the in-plane spare stocks (retailers) would\nreceive the resupply from the closest (i.e., minimum waiting time) available\nwarehouse at the time of delivery. The parking orbits (warehouses) are also\nresupplied from the ground (supplier) with stochastic lead time caused by the\norder processing and launch opportunities, leveraging the cost saving effects\nby launching many satellites in one rocket (i.e., batch launch discount). The\nproposed analytical model is validated against simulations using Latin\nHypercube Sampling. Furthermore, based on the proposed model, an optimization\nformulation is introduced to identify the optimal spare strategy, comprising\nthe parking orbits characteristics and all locations policies, to minimize the\nmaintenance cost of the system given performance requirements. The proposed\nmodel and optimization method are applied to a real-world case study of\nsatellite mega-constellation to demonstrate their value.",
