    "abstract": "Abstract:  Energy harvesting is the fundamental activity in almost all forms of space\nexploration known to humans. So far, in most cases, it is not feasible to\nbring, along with probe, spacecraft or rover suitable supply of fuel to cover\nall mission's energy needs. Some concepts of mining or other form of\nmanufacturing of fuel on exploration site have been made, but they still base\neither on some facility that needs one mean of energy to generate fuel, perhaps\nof better quality, or needs some initial energy to be harvested to start a self\nsustaining cycle. Following paper summarizes key factors that determine\nsatellite energy needs, and explains some either most widespread or most\ninteresting examples of energy harvesting devices, present in Earth orbit as\nwell as exploring Solar System and, very recently, beyond. Some of presented\nenergy harvester are suitable for very large (in terms of size and\nfunctionality) probes, other fit and scale easily on satellites ranging from\ndozens of tons to few grams.",

In addition, ExoSOFT is packaged with a collection of\npost-processing tools to analyze and summarize the results. Although only a few\nsystems have been observed with both the radial velocity and direct imaging\ntechniques, this number will increase thanks to upcoming spacecraft and ground\nbased surveys. Providing both forms of data enables simultaneous fitting that\ncan help break degeneracies in the orbital elements that arise when only one\ndata type is available. The dynamical mass estimates this approach can produce\nare important when investigating the formation mechanisms and subsequent\nevolution of substellar companions.

Can such objects be intercepted? The\nchallenge of reaching the object within a reasonable timeframe is formidable\ndue to its high heliocentric hyperbolic excess velocity of about 26 km/s; much\nfaster than any vehicle yet launched. This paper presents a high-level analysis\nof potential near-term options for a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua and potential\nsimilar objects. Launching a spacecraft to 1I/'Oumuamua in a reasonable\ntimeframe of 5-10 years requires a hyperbolic solar system excess velocity\nbetween 33 to 76 km/s for mission durations between 30 to 5 years. Different\nmission durations and their velocity requirements are explored with respect to\nthe launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept\ntrajectory. For missions using a powered Jupiter flyby combined with a solar\nOberth maneuver using solid rocket boosters and Parker Solar Probe heat shield\ntechnology, a Falcon Heavy-class launcher would be able to launch a spacecraft\nof dozens of kilograms towards 1I/'Oumuamua, if launched in 2021. An additional\nSaturn flyby would allow for the launch of a New Horizons-class spacecraft.\nFurther technology options are outlined, ranging from electric propulsion, and\nmore advanced options such as laser electric propulsion, and solar and laser\nsails. To maximize science return decelerating the spacecraft at 'Oumuamua is\nhighly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity\nencounter. Electric and magnetic sails could be used for this purpose. It is\nconcluded that although reaching the object is challenging, there seem to be\nfeasible options based on current and near-term technology.",

Orbital analysis\nin several flybys of the Earth since the Galileo spacecraft flyby of the Earth\nin 1990 have shown that the asymptotic post-encounter velocity exhibits a\ndifference with the initial velocity that cannot be attributed to conventional\neffects. To elucidate its origin, we have developed an orbital program for\nanalyzing the trajectory of the spacecraft in the vicinity of the perigee,\nincluding both the Sun and the Moon's tidal perturbations and the geopotential\nzonal, tesseral and sectorial harmonics provided by the EGM96 model. The\nmagnitude and direction of the anomalous acceleration acting upon the\nspacecraft can be estimated from the orbital determination program by comparing\nwith the trajectories fitted to telemetry data as provided by the mission\nteams. This acceleration amounts to a fraction of a mm/s$^2$ and decays very\nfast with altitude. The possibility of some new physics of gravity in the\naltitude range for spacecraft flybys is discussed.",

A 1.8 to 4.1 lower-limit ratio between\ngravitational and magnetic tension forces was found.

A possible science payload includes instruments for\nsurface imaging, characterisation of the neutral exosphere, and magnetic field\nand plasma measurement near the target body down to very low-altitudes (~1 km),\nduring the probe's fast (~km/s) descent to the surface until impact.

Another type\nis a traveling foreshock that is bounded by two rotational discontinuities in\nthe interplanetary magnetic field and propagates along the bow-shock. Foreshock\ncompressional boundaries are found at the edges of both types of foreshock. We\nshow that isolated foreshock cavities are a subset of the traveling foreshock\nthat form when two bounding rotational discontinuities are so close that the\nultra-low frequency waves do not develop in the region between them. We also\nreport observations of a spontaneous hot flow anomaly inside a traveling\nforeshock. This means that other phenomena, such as foreshock cavitons, may\nalso exist inside this type of foreshock. In the second part of this work we\npresent statistical properties of phenomena related to the foreshock, namely\nforeshock cavities, cavitons, spontaneous hot flow anomalies and foreshock\ncompressional boundaries.

In many\ncontexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar\nspectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by\nsystematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope,\nor the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for\nthese nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many\n(unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes,\nhousekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as\npredictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of\nthese predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can\ncapture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics\nprior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a\nsimultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that\nif a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the\nweights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which\ncan (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the\napplicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2\ntime-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft\nmotion and variability.",

This process\ncan be described by the Parker equation, which calculates the phase space\ndistribution of GCRs depending on the main modulation processes: convection,\ndrifts, diffusion and adiabatic energy changes. A first order approximation of\nthis equation is the force field approach, reducing it to a one-parameter\ndependency, the solar modulation potential $\\phi$. Utilizing this approach, it\nis possible to reconstruct $\\phi$ from ground based and spacecraft\nmeasurements. However, it has been shown previously that $\\phi$ depends not\nonly on the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) but also on the energy range of\ninterest. We have investigated this energy dependence further, using published\nproton intensity spectra obtained by PAMELA as well as heavier nuclei\nmeasurements from IMP-8 and ACE/CRIS. Our results show severe limitations at\nlower energies including a strong dependence on the solar magnetic epoch. Based\non these findings, we will outline a new tool to describe GCR proton spectra in\nthe energy range from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV over the last solar\ncycles. In order to show the importance of our modification, we calculate the\nglobal production rates of the cosmogenic radionuclide $^{10}$Be which is a\nproxy for the solar activity ranging back thousands of years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar coronal jets are small, transient, collimated ejections most easily\nobserved in coronal holes (CHs). The upcoming Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission\nprovides the first opportunity to encounter CH jets in situ near the Sun and\nexamine their internal structure and dynamics. Using projected mission orbital\nparameters, we have simulated PSP encounters with a fully three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of a CH jet. We find that three internal jet\nregions, featuring different wave modes and levels of compressibility, have\ndistinct identifying signatures detectable by PSP. The leading Alfv\u00e9n wave\nfront and its immediate wake are characterized by trans-Alfv\u00e9nic plasma\nflows with mild density enhancements. This front exhibits characteristics of a\nfast switch-on MHD shock, whose arrival is signaled by the sudden onset of\nlarge-amplitude transverse velocity and magnetic-field oscillations highly\ncorrelated in space and time. The trailing portion is characterized by\nsupersonic but sub-Alfv\u00e9nic outflows of dense plasma with uncorrelated\nvelocity and magnetic-field oscillations. This compressible region contains\nmost of the jet's mass. The volume between the immediate wake and dense jet,\nthe remote wake, mixes and transitions the characteristics of the two other\nregions. In addition to probing each region separately, we also simulate a\nco-rotational PSP-jet encounter. In this scenario, the simulated spacecraft\nhovers over the jet-producing CH, as may occur during the mission's\nco-rotational phases, sampling each jet region in turn. We estimate that PSP\nwill encounter numerous CH jets over the lifetime of the mission.",

Variations in\ncomposition across the asteroid populations provide a tracer for the dynamical\nevolution of the Solar System.

The\nscientific payload comprises a 50 cm diameter telescope that includes an\nintegrated low-resolution (R = 30 to 100) spectrometer and visible context\nimager, a thermal (e.g. 6 to 16 microns) imager for use during the flybys, and\nmodified star tracker cameras to detect small (approx. 10 m) asteroids.

In space, cosmic rays irradiate spacecraft\nand instrument, which results in a large instrumental background from\nactivation of those materials, and leads to deterioration of the charge\ncollection properties of the Ge detectors. We use 13.5 years of INTEGRAL/SPI\nspectra for each detector and for each pointing of the satellite. Spectral fits\nprovide us with details about separated background components. From the\nstrongest background lines, we first determine how the spectral response\nchanges with time. We then determine how the instrumental background components\nchange in intensities and other characteristics, most-importantly their\nrelative distribution among detectors. Spectral resolution of Ge detectors in\nspace degrades with time, up to 15% within half a year, consistently for all\ndetectors, and across the SPI energy range. Semi-annual annealing operations\nrecover these losses, yet there is a small long-term degradation. The intensity\nof instrumental background varies anti-correlated to solar activity, in\ngeneral. There are significant differences among different lines and with\nrespect to continuum. Background lines are found to have a characteristic,\nwell-defined and long-term consistent intensity ratio among detectors. We use\nthis to categorise lines in groups of similar behaviour. The dataset of\nspectral-response and background parameters as fitted across the INTEGRAL\nmission allows studies of SPI spectral response and background behaviour in a\nbroad perspective, and efficiently supports precision modelling of instrumental\nbackground.",

It is\nfound that the fraction of the SDE $\\geq$M1.0-class flares (including spikes)\nin Cycle 24 exceeds that in Cycle 23 in all three temporal parameters at the\nmaximum phase and in the decay time during the ascending cycle phase. However,\nCycles 23 and 24 barely differ in the fraction of the SDE C-class flares. The\ntemporal parameters of SDEs, their fraction, and consequently the relationship\nbetween the SDE and LDE flares do not remain constant, but they reveal regular\nchanges within individual cycles and during the transition from one cycle to\nanother. In all phases of all four cycles, these changes have the character of\npronounced, large-amplitude \"quasi-biennial\" oscillations (QBOs). In different\ncycles and at the separate phases of individual cycles, such QBOs are\nsuperimposed on various systematic trends displayed by the analyzed temporal\nflare parameters. In Cycle 24, the fraction of the SDE $\\geq$M1.0-class flares\nfrom the N- and S-hemispheres displays the most pronounced synchronous QBOs.\nThe QBO amplitude and general variability of the intense $\\geq$M1.0-class\nflares almost always markedly exceeds those of the moderate C-class flares. The\nordered quantitative and qualitative variations of the flare type revealed in\nthe course of the solar cycles are discussed within the framework of the\nconcept that the SDE flares are associated mainly with small sunspots\n(including those in developed active regions) and that small and large sunspots\nbehave differently during cycles and form two distinct populations.",

Several different morphologies of the power\nspectrum can be identified: (1) two power laws separated by a break (2) an\nexponential cutoff near the Taylor shifted electron scales and (3) strong\nspectral knees at the Taylor shifted electron scales. These different\nmorphologies are investigated by using wavelet coherence, showing that in this\ninterval a clear break and strong spectral knees are features which are\nassociated with sporadic quasi parallel propagating whistler waves, even for\nshort times. On the other hand, when no signatures of whistler waves at 0.1 -\n0.2fce are present, a clear break is difficult to find and the spectrum is\noften more characteristic of a power law with an exponential cutoff.",

CME\nmagnetic flux ropes can lead to continuous forcing of the energy input to the\nEarth's magnetosphere by strong and steady southward-pointing magnetic fields.\nHere, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept way a new approach to predict the\nsouthward field Bz in a CME flux rope. It combines a novel semi-empirical model\nof CME flux rope magnetic fields (3-Dimensional Coronal ROpe Ejection or\n3DCORE) with solar observations and in situ magnetic field data from along the\nSun-Earth line. These are provided here by the MESSENGER spacecraft for a CME\nevent on 2013 July 9-13. 3DCORE is the first such model that contains the\ninterplanetary propagation and evolution of a 3D flux rope magnetic field, the\nobservation by a synthetic spacecraft and the prediction of an index of\ngeomagnetic activity. A counterclockwise rotation of the left-handed erupting\nCME flux rope in the corona of 30 degree and a deflection angle of 20 degree is\nevident from comparison of solar and coronal observations. The calculated Dst\nmatches reasonably the observed Dst minimum and its time evolution, but the\nresults are highly sensitive to the CME axis orientation. We discuss\nassumptions and limitations of the method prototype and its potential for real\ntime space weather forecasting and heliospheric data interpretation.",

After a successful cruise, the malfunction happened\non the propulsion system during the Venus orbit insertion (VOI) on Dec 7, 2010.\nThe engine shut down before the planned reduction in speed to achieve. The\nspacecraft did not enter the Venus orbit, but entered an orbit around the Sun\nwith a period of 203 days. Most of the fuel still had remained, but the orbital\nmaneuvering engine was found to be broken and unusable. However, we have found\nan alternate way of achieving orbit by using only the reaction control system\n(RSC). We had adopted the alternate way for orbital maneuver and three minor\nmaneuvers in Nov 2011 were successfully done so that AKATSUKI would meet Venus\nin 2015. We are considering several scenarios for VOI using only RCS.",

We used narrowband images obtained by the Medium Resolution\nImager (MRI) onboard the spacecraft to study the gas and dust in the innermost\ncoma. We derived an overall dust reddening of 15\\%/100 nm between 345 and 749\nnm and identified a blue enhancement in the dust coma in the sunward direction\nwithin 5 km from the nucleus, which we interpret as a localized enrichment in\nwater ice. OH column density maps show an anti-sunward enhancement throughout\nthe encounter except for the highest resolution images, acquired at CA, where a\nradial jet becomes visible in the innermost coma, extending up to 12 km from\nthe nucleus. The OH distribution in the inner coma is very different from that\nexpected for a fragment species. Instead, it correlates well with the water\nvapor map derived by the HRI-IR instrument onboard Deep Impact\n\\citep{AHearn2011}. Radial profiles of the OH column density and derived water\nproduction rates show an excess of OH emission during CA that cannot be\nexplained with pure fluorescence. We attribute this excess to a prompt emission\nprocess where photodissociation of H$_2$O directly produces excited\nOH*($A^2\\it{\\Sigma}^+$) radicals. Our observations provide the first direct\nimaging of Near-UV prompt emission of OH. We therefore suggest the use of a\ndedicated filter centered at 318.8 nm to directly trace the water in the coma\nof comets.",

(2.) Stereoscopy of coronal magnetic\nloops observed in EUV coronal images from different vantage points. Both\napproaches have their strength and weaknesses. Extrapolation methods are\nsensitive to noise and inconsistencies in the boundary data and the accuracy of\nstereoscopy is affected by the ability of identifying the same structure in\ndifferent images and by the separation angle between the view directions. As a\nconsequence, for the same observational data, the computed 3D coronal magnetic\nfield with the two methods do not necessarily coincide. In an earlier work\n(Paper I) we extended our NLFFF optimization code by the inclusion of\nstereoscopic constrains. The method was successfully tested with synthetic data\nand within this work we apply the newly developed code to a combined data-set\nfrom SDO/HMI, SDO/AIA and the two STEREO spacecraft. The extended method\n(called S-NLFFF) contains an additional term that monitors and minimizes the\nangle between the local magnetic field direction and the orientation of the 3D\ncoronal loops reconstructed by stereoscopy. We find that prescribing the shape\nof the 3D stereoscopically reconstructed loops the S-NLFFF method leads to a\nmuch better agreement between the modeled field and the stereoscopically\nreconstructed loops. We also find an appreciable decrease by a factor of two in\nthe angle between the current and the magnetic field which indicates the\nimproved quality of the force-free solution obtained by S-NLFFF.",

The first two techniques have respectively been applied to the cases\nof a spacecraft either always remaining very far or occasionally experiencing\nextremely close approaches to the third body. However, the paper also seeks\nsolutions for trajectories that undergo one or more close approaches at\ndistances in the order of the sphere of influence of the third body.

However, such an event could\nprovide us a good opportunity to study the evolution of embedded Alfv\u00e9nic\nfluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma heating\ndirectly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998\nis tracked to the location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside\nthe ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence rate of 21.7% and at broadband\nfrequencies from 4$\\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When the ICME\npropagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\u00e9nicity decreases significantly, and AFs are\nrare and only found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate\ndecreasing to 3.0%. At the same time, the magnetic field intensity at the\nAF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME expansion effect.\nThe energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated\nhere. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the\nturbulence cascade rate at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at\nthe AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain as the decrease of magnetic field\nintensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many AFs, it\nreduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation\nrate within the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$,\nwhich satisfies the requirement of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2\n$J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$. We suggest that AF dissipation is responsible for\nextra magnetic dissipation and local plasma heating inside ICME.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Exploration of asteroids and comets can give insight into the origins of the\nsolar system and can be instrumental in planetary defence and in-situ resource\nutilization (ISRU). Asteroids, due to their low gravity are a challenging\ntarget for surface exploration. Current missions envision performing\ntouch-and-go operations over an asteroid surface. In this work, we analyse the\nfeasibility of sending scores of nano-landers, each 1 kg in mass and volume of\n1U, or 1000 cm3. These landers would hop, roll and fly over the asteroid\nsurface. The landers would include science instruments such as stereo cameras,\nhand-lens imagers and spectrometers to characterize rock composition. A network\nof nano-landers situated on the surface of an asteroid can provide unique and\nvery detailed measurements of a spacecraft impacting onto an asteroid surface.\nA full-scale, artificial impact experiment onto an asteroid can help\ncharacterize its composition and geology and help in the development of\nasteroid deflection techniques intended for planetary defence. Scores of\nnano-landers could provide multiple complementary views of the impact,\nresultant seismic activity and trajectory of the ejecta. The nano-landers can\nanalyse the pristine, unearthed regolith shielded from effects of UV and cosmic\nrays and that may be millions of years old. Our approach to formulating this\nmission concepts utilizes automated machine learning techniques in the planning\nand design of space systems. We use a form of Darwinian selection to select and\nidentify suitable number of nano-landers, the on-board instruments and control\nsystem to explore and navigate the asteroid environment. Scenarios are\ngenerated in simulation and evaluated against quantifiable mission goals such\nas area explored on the asteroid and amount of data recorded from the impact\nevent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) probe the foundations of\nphysics. Ever since Galileo in the early 1600s, WEP tests have attracted some\nof the best experimentalists of any time. Progress has come in bursts, each\nstimulated by the introduction of a new technique: the torsion balance, signal\nmodulation by Earth rotation, the rotating torsion balance. Tests for various\nmaterials in the field of the Earth and the Sun have found no violation to the\nlevel of about 1 part in 1e13. A different technique, Lunar Laser Ranging\n(LLR), has reached comparable precision. Today, both laboratory tests and LLR\nhave reached a point when improving by a factor of 10 is extremely hard. The\npromise of another quantum leap in precision rests on experiments performed in\nlow Earth orbit. The Microscope satellite, launched in April 2016 and currently\ntaking data, aims to test WEP in the field of Earth to 1e-15, a 100-fold\nimprovement possible thanks to a driving signal in orbit almost 500 times\nstronger than for torsion balances on ground. The `Galileo Galilei' (GG)\nexperiment, by combining the advantages of space with those of the rotating\ntorsion balance, aims at a WEP test 100 times more precise than Microscope, to\n1e-17. A quantitative comparison of the key issues in the two experiments is\npresented, along with recent experimental measurements relevant for GG. Early\nresults from Microscope, reported at a conference in March 2017, show\nmeasurement performance close to the expectations and confirm the key role of\nrotation with the advantage (unique to space) of rotating the whole spacecraft.\nAny non-null result from Microscope would be a major discovery and call for\nurgent confirmation; with 100 times better precision GG could settle the matter\nand provide a deeper probe of the foundations of physics.",

Eight X-ray mirror modules\n(seven flight and one spare units) for ART-XC were developed and fabricated at\nthe Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NASA, USA. We present results of\ntesting procedures performed with an X-ray beam facility at MSFC to calibrate\nthe point spread function (PSF) of the mirror modules. The shape of the PSF was\nmeasured with a high-resolution CCD camera installed in the focal plane with\ndefocusing of 7 mm, as required by the ART-XC design. For each module, we\nperformed a parametrization of the PSF at various angular distances Theta. We\nused a King function to approximate the radial profile of the near on-axis PSF\n(Theta<9 arcmin) and an ellipse fitting procedure to describe the morphology of\nthe far off-axis angular response (9<Theta<24 arcmin). We found a good\nagreement between the seven ART-XC flight mirror modules at the level of 10%.\nThe on-axis angular resolution of the ART-XC optics varies between 27 and 33\narcsec (half-power diameter), except for the spare module.",

Rather than relying on\nsliding mode control or optimization based methods, the proposed approach\navoids the increased control utilization and computational complexity inherent\nin other techniques.

We find Saturn's polar-flattened magnetosphere to channel\n~20% more flow over the poles than around the flanks at the terminator.\nFurther, we decompose the MHD forces responsible for accelerating the\nmagnetosheath plasma to find the plasma pressure gradient as the dominant\ndriver. This is by virtue of a high-beta magnetosheath, and in turn, the\nhigh-MA bow shock. Together with long-term magnetosheath data by the Cassini\nspacecraft, we present evidence of how nonaxisymmetry substantially alters the\nconditions further downstream at the magnetopause, crucial for understanding\nsolar wind-magnetosphere interactions such as reconnection and shear\nflow-driven instabilities. We anticipate our results to provide a more accurate\ninsight into the global conditions upstream of Saturn and the outer planets.",

Vs/c has mainly been negative, driven by the\nhigh temperature (~5-10 eV) of the coma photoelectrons. The magnitude of the\nnegative Vs/c traces heliocentric, cometocentric, seasonal and diurnal\nvariations in cometary outgassing, consistent with production at or inside the\ncometocentric distance of the spacecraft being the dominant source of the\nobserved plasma. LAP only picks up a portion of the full Vs/c since the two\nprobes, mounted on booms of 2.2 and 1.6 m length, respectively, are generally\ninside the potential field of the spacecraft. Comparing with the minimum energy\nof positive ions collected by ICA, we find numerous cases with strong cor-\nrelation between the two instruments, from which the fraction of Vs/c picked up\nby LAP is found to vary between about 0.7 and 1. We also find an ICA energy\noffset of 13.7 eV (95% CI: [12.5, 15.0]). Many cases of poor correlation\nbetween the instruments are also observed, predominantly when local ion\nproduction is weak and accelerated ions dominate the flux, or during quiet\nperiods with low dynamic range in Vs/c and consequently low signal-to-noise\nratios.",

Miniaturized satellites, however, suffer from low reliability,\nas traditional hardware-based fault-tolerance (FT) concepts are ineffective for\non-board computers (OBCs) utilizing modern systems-on-a-chip (SoC). Therefore,\nlarger satellites continue to rely on proven processors with large feature\nsizes. Software-based concepts have largely been ignored by the space industry\nas they were researched only in theory, and have not yet reached the level of\nmaturity necessary for implementation. We present the first integral,\nreal-world solution to enable fault-tolerant general-purpose computing with\nmodern multiprocessor-SoCs (MPSoCs) for spaceflight, thereby enabling their use\nin future high-priority space missions. The presented multi-stage approach\nconsists of three FT stages, combining coarse-grained thread-level distributed\nself-validation, FPGA reconfiguration, and mixed criticality to assure\nlong-term FT and excellent scalability for both resource constrained and\ncritical high-priority space missions. Early benchmark results indicate a\ndrastic performance increase over state-of-the-art radiation-hard OBC designs\nand considerably lower software- and hardware development costs. This approach\nwas developed for a 4-year European Space Agency (ESA) project, and we are\nimplementing a tiled MPSoC prototype jointly with two industrial partners.",

Spectroscopic indicators of unequal\ntemperatures commence within a fraction of a solar radius above the surface of\nthe Sun, but the outer reach of this mechanism has yet to be determined. Here\nwe present an empirical procedure for combining interplanetary solar wind\nmeasurements and a modeled energy equation including Coulomb relaxation to\nsolve for the typical outer boundary of this zone of preferential heating.\nApplied to two decades of observations by the Wind spacecraft, our results are\nconsistent with preferential heating being active in a zone extending from the\ntransition region in the lower corona to an outer boundary 20-40 solar radii\nfrom the Sun, producing a steady state super-mass-proportional\n$\\alpha$-to-proton temperature ratio of $5.2-5.3$. Preferential ion heating\ncontinues far beyond the transition region and is important for the evolution\nof both the outer corona and the solar wind. The outer boundary of this zone is\nwell below the orbits of spacecraft at 1 AU and even closer missions such as\nHelios and MESSENGER, meaning it is likely that no existing mission has\ndirectly observed intense preferential heating, just residual signatures. We\npredict that {Parker Solar Probe} will be the first spacecraft with a perihelia\nsufficiently close to the Sun to pass through the outer boundary, enter the\nzone of preferential heating, and directly observe the physical mechanism in\naction.",
