We compared the observed\npositions of the planet Mars and its satellites with the theoretical positions\nfrom INPOP10 and DE430 planetary ephemerides, and from NOE and MAR097 satellite\nephemerides. The rms residuals in RA and Dec. of one position is less than 60\nmas, or about 20 km at Mars. This accuracy is comparable to the most recent CCD\nobservations. Moreover, it shows that astrometric data derived from\nphotographic plates can compete with those of old spacecraft (Mariner 9, Viking\n1 and 2).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Satellites of asteroids have been discovered in nearly every known small body\npopulation, and a remarkable aspect of the known satellites is the diversity of\ntheir properties. They tell a story of vast differences in formation and\nevolution mechanisms that act as a function of size, distance from the Sun, and\nthe properties of their nebular environment at the beginning of Solar System\nhistory and their dynamical environment over the next 4.5 Gyr. The mere\nexistence of these systems provides a laboratory to study numerous types of\nphysical processes acting on asteroids and their dynamics provide a valuable\nprobe of their physical properties otherwise possible only with spacecraft.\nAdvances in understanding the formation and evolution of binary systems have\nbeen assisted by: 1) the growing catalog of known systems, increasing from 33\nto nearly 250 between the Merline et al. (2002) Asteroids III chapter and now,\n2) the detailed study and long-term monitoring of individual systems such as\n1999 KW4 and 1996 FG3, 3) the discovery of new binary system morphologies and\ntriple systems, 4) and the discovery of unbound systems that appear to be\nend-states of binary dynamical evolutionary paths.\nSpecifically for small bodies (diameter smaller than 10 km), these\nobservations and discoveries have motivated theoretical work finding that\nthermal forces can efficiently drive the rotational disruption of small\nasteroids. Long-term monitoring has allowed studies to constrain the system's\ndynamical evolution by the combination of tides, thermal forces and rigid body\nphysics. The outliers and split pairs have pushed the theoretical work to\nexplore a wide range of evolutionary end-states.",

Observed surface temperature on Europa is 120 and 80 K in the\nequatorial region and polar region, respectively. At such low temperatures,\nGibbs energies of polymerization become negative, and the estimated thermal\nstructure of the icy crust should contain a shallow region (i.e., at a depth of\nonly a few kilometers) favorable for polymerization.

The purpose of this paper is to\nstudy the relative role of parallel versus oblique Alfv\u00e9n-cyclotron waves in\nthe observed heating and acceleration of minor ions in the fast solar wind. We\nconsider collisionless homogeneous multi-species plasma, consisting of\nisothermal electrons, isotropic protons and a minor component of drifting\n$\\alpha$ particles in a finite-$\\beta$ fast stream near the Earth. The kinetic\nions are modeled by initially isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution\nfunctions, which develop non-thermal features and temperature anisotropies when\na broad-band spectrum of low-frequency non-resonant, $\\omega \\leq 0.34\n\\Omega_p$, Alfv\u00e9n-cyclotron waves is imposed at the beginning of the\nsimulations. The initial plasma parameter values, such as ion density,\ntemperatures and relative drift speeds, are supplied by fast solar wind\nobservations made by the \\textit{Wind} spacecraft at 1AU. The imposed\nbroad-band wave spectra is left-hand polarized and resembles \\textit{Wind}\nmeasurements of Alfv\u00e9nic turbulence in the solar wind. The imposed magnetic\nfield fluctuations for all cases are within the inertial range of the solar\nwind turbulence and have a Kraichnan-type spectral slope $\\alpha=-3/2$. We vary\nthe propagation angle from $\\theta= 0^\\circ$ to $\\theta=30^\\circ$ and\n$\\theta=60^\\circ$, and find that the minor ion heating is most efficient for\nthe highly-oblique waves propagating at $60^\\circ$, whereas the protons exhibit\nperpendicular cooling at all propagation angles.",

The\nexistence and stability of triangular equilibrium points have been explored. It\nhas been shown that triangular equilibrium points are stable for $0<\\mu<\\mu_c$\nand unstable for $\\mu_c\\leq\\mu\\leq1/2$, where $\\mu_c$ denotes the critical mass\nparameter. We find that, the oblateness up to $J_2$ of the primaries and the\nradiation reduces the stability range while the oblateness up to $J_4$ of the\nprimaries increases the size of stability both in the context where PDP is\nconsidered and ignored. The PDP has an effect of about $\\approx0.01$ reduction\non the application of $\\mu_c$ to Earth-Moon and Jupiter-Moons systems.

As a large population of small bodies, they record important\ngravitational interactions and dynamical evolution of the Solar System. In the\npast decade, significant advances have been made in understanding physical\nproperties, and there has been a revolution in thinking about the origin of\nTrojans. The ice and organics generally presumed to be a significant part of\nTrojan compositions have yet to be detected directly, though low density of the\nbinary system Patroclus (and possibly low density of the binary/moonlet system\nHektor) is consistent with an interior ice component. By contrast, fine-grained\nsilicates that appear to be similar to cometary silicates in composition have\nbeen detected, and a color bimodality may indicate distinct compositional\ngroups among the Trojans. Whereas Trojans had traditionally been thought to\nhave formed near 5 AU, a new paradigm has developed in which the Trojans formed\nin the proto-Kuiper Belt, and they were scattered inward and captured in the\nTrojan swarms as a result of resonant interactions of the giant planets.\nWhereas the orbital and population distributions of current Trojans are\nconsistent with this origin scenario, there are significant differences between\ncurrent physical properties of Trojans and those of Kuiper Belt objects. These\ndifferences may be indicative of surface modification due to the inward\nmigration of objects that became the Trojans, but understanding of appropriate\nmodification mechanisms is poor and would benefit from additional laboratory\nstudies. Many open questions remain, and the future promises significant\nstrides in our understanding of Trojans.

We aimed\nto obtain good astrometric positions of irregular satellites to improve their\norbits and ephemeris. We identified and reduced observations of several\nirregular satellites from three databases containing more than 8000 images\nobtained between 1992 and 2014 at three sites (Observat\u00f3rio do Pico dos Dias,\nObservatoire de Haute-Provence, and European Southern Observatory - La Silla).\nWe used the software PRAIA (Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images\nAutomatically) to make the astrometric reduction of the CCD frames. The UCAC4\ncatalog represented the International Celestial Reference System in the\nreductions. Identification of the satellites in the frames was done through\ntheir ephemerides as determined from the SPICE/NAIF kernels. Some procedures\nwere followed to overcome missing or incomplete information (coordinates,\ndate), mostly for the older images. We managed to obtain more than 6000\npositions for 18 irregular satellites: 12 of Jupiter, 4 of Saturn, 1 of Uranus\n(Sycorax), and 1 of Neptune (Nereid). For some satellites the number of\nobtained positions is more than 50\\% of what was used in earlier orbital\nnumerical integrations. Comparison of our positions with recent JPL ephemeris\nsuggests there are systematic errors in the orbits for some of the irregular\nsatellites.

The emerging jet-like structures persist for a\nwide range of gas-dust interactions and show a dust velocity dependent bending.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In-situ spacecraft observations recently suggested that the transport of\nenergetic particles accelerated at heliospheric shocks can be anomalous, i.e.\nthe mean square displacement can grow non-linearly in time. In particular, a\nnew analysis technique has permitted the study of particle transport properties\nfrom energetic particle time profiles upstream of interplanetary shocks.\nIndeed, the time/spatial power laws of the differential intensity upstream of\nseveral shocks are indicative of superdiffusion. A complete determination of\nthe key parameters of superdiffusive transport comprises the power-law index,\nthe superdiffusion coefficient, the related transition scale at which the\nenergetic particle profiles turn to decay as power laws, and the energy\nspectral index of the shock accelerated particles. Assuming large-scale spatial\nhomogeneity of the background plasma, the power-law behaviour can been derived\nfrom both a (microscopic) propagator formalism and a (macroscopic) fractional\ntransport equation. We compare the two approaches and find a relation between\nthe diffusion coefficients used in the two formalisms. Based on the assumption\nof superdiffusive transport, we quantitatively derive these parameters by\nstudying energetic particle profiles observed by the Ulysses and Voyager 2\nspacecraft upstream of shocks in the heliosphere, for which a superdiffusive\nparticle transport has previously been observed. Further, we have jointly\nstudied the electron energy spectra, comparing the values of the spectral\nindices observed with those predicted by the standard diffusive shock\nacceleration theory and by a model based on superdiffusive transport. For a\nnumber of interplanetary shocks and for the solar wind termination shock, for\nthe first time we obtain the anomalous diffusion constants and the scale at\nwhich the probability of particle free paths changes to a power-law...",

This\nsimply implies that fractal is a shape that it would still look the same even\nif somebody could zoom in on one of its parts an infinite number of times. This\nproperty is also called self-similarity with several applications including\nnano pharmacology and drug nano carriers. We are interested in the study of the\nproperties of fractal aggregates in a microgravity environment above an\norbiting spacecraft. To model the effect we use a complete expression for the\ngravitational acceleration. In particular on the surface of the Earth the\nacceleration is corrected for the effect of oblateness and rotation. In the\ngravitational acceleration the effect of oblateness can be modeled with the\ninclusion of a term that contains the J2 harmonic coefficient, as well as a\nterm that depends on the square of angular velocity of the Earth. In orbit the\nacceleration of gravity at the point of the spacecraft is a function of the\norbital elements and includes only in our case the J2 harmonic since no\ncoriolis force is felt by the spacecraft. Using the fitting parameter d = 3.0\nwe have found that the aggregate monomer number N is not significantly affected\nand exhibits a minute 0.0001% difference between the geocentric and areocentric\nlatitudes of 90 degrees and 0 degrees. Finally for circular and elliptical\norbits around Earth and Mars of various inclinations and eccentricities the\naggregate monomer number is not affected at all at the orbital altitude of 300\nkm.",

Previous efforts to detect civilizations\nbased on side effects of planetary-scale engineering have focused on structures\naffecting the host star output (e.g. Dyson spheres). However, younger\ncivilizations are likely to be less advanced in their engineering efforts, yet\nstill capable of sending small spacecraft into orbit. Since M dwarfs are the\nmost common type of star in the solar neighborhood, it seems plausible that\nmany of the nearest habitable planets orbit dim, low-mass M stars, and will be\nin synchronous rotation. Logically, a civilization evolving on such a planet\nmay be inspired to illuminate their planet's dark side by placing a single\nlarge mirror at the L2 Lagrangian point, or launching a fleet of small thin\nmirrors into planetary orbit. We briefly examine the requirements and\nengineering challenges of such a collection of orbiting mirrors, then explore\ntheir impact on transit light curves. We incorporate stellar limb darkening and\nmodel a simplistic mirror fleet's effects for transits of Earth-like (R = 0.5\nto 2 R_Earth) planets which would be synchronously rotating for orbits within\nthe habitable zone of their host star.

Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased\nspacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals\nfrom the data. We here develop a method for producing periodograms of K2 light\ncurves that are insensitive to pointing-induced systematics; the\nSystematics-Insensitive Periodogram (SIP). Traditional sine-fitting\nperiodograms use a generative model to find the frequency of a sinusoid that\nbest describes the data. We extend this principle by including systematic\ntrends, based on a set of 'Eigen light curves', following Foreman-Mackey et al.\n(2015), in our generative model as well as a sum of sine and cosine functions\nover a grid of frequencies. Using this method we are able to produce\nperiodograms with vastly reduced systematic features. The quality of the\nresulting periodograms are such that we can recover acoustic oscillations in\ngiant stars and measure stellar rotation periods without the need for any\ndetrending. The algorithm is also applicable to the detection of other periodic\nphenomena such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries and short-period exoplanet\ncandidates.

Our ground-based lightcurve aligns with the published EPOXI\nlightcurve, indicating that the lightcurve represents changing activity rather\nthan viewing geometry of structures in the coma. The EPOXI lightcurve can best\nbe phased by a triple-peaked period near 54-55 hr that increases from October\nto November. This phasing reveals that the spacing between maxima is not\nconstant, and that the overall lightcurve shape evolves from one triple-peaked\ncycle to the next. These behaviors suggest that much of the scatter in apparent\nperiods derived from ground-based datasets acquired at similar epochs are\nlikely due to limited sampling of the data.",

In some more recent papers, however, electrons play a new\nimportant role in the shock dynamics and thermodynamics, especially at the\nsolar-wind termination shock. They react on the shock electric field in a very\nspecific way, leading to suprathermal nonequilibrium distributions of the\ndownstream electrons, which can be represented by a kappa distribution\nfunction. In this paper, we discuss why this anticipated hot electron\npopulation has not been seen by the plasma detectors of the Voyager spacecraft\ndownstream of the solar-wind termination shock. We show that hot nonequilibrium\nelectrons induce a strong negative electric charge-up of any spacecraft\ncruising through this downstream plasma environment. This charge reduces\nelectron fluxes at the spacecraft detectors to nondetectable intensities.\nFurthermore, we show that the Debye length $\\lambda _{\\mathrm D}^{\\kappa}$\ngrows to values of about $\\lambda _{\\mathrm D}^{\\kappa}/\\lambda _{\\mathrm\nD}\\simeq 10^{6}$ compared to the classical value $\\lambda _{\\mathrm D}$ in this\nhot-electron environment. This unusual condition allows for the propagation of\na certain type of electrostatic plasma waves that, at very large wavelengths,\nallow us to determine the effective temperature of the suprathermal electrons\ndirectly by means of the phase velocity of these waves. At moderate\nwavelengths, the electron-acoustic dispersion relation leads to nonpropagating\noscillations with the ion-plasma frequency $\\omega _{\\mathrm p}$ , instead of\nthe traditional electron plasma frequency.",

For this purpose from data\non about 350 flares observed from January 2007 to July 2014 (mainly exceeding\nthe GOES M1.0 level) both with GOES and STEREO, an empirical relation is\nestablished correlating the GOES 1-8 A peak flux and the B-streak length.

The standard two-step mapping technique is adopted to\nestablish the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic flux tubes along which\nthe ACE winds flow. The footpoints are then placed in the context of EIT\n284~\u00c5 images and photospheric magnetograms, allowing us to categorize the\nsources into four groups: coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), the quiet\nSun (QS), and \"Undefined\". This practice also enables us to establish the\nresponse to solar activity of the fractions occupied by each kind of solar\nwinds, and of their speeds and O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios measured in situ. We\nfind that during the maximum phase, the majority of ACE winds originate from\nARs. During the declining phase, CHs and ARs are equally important contributors\nto the ACE solar winds. The QS contribution increases with decreasing solar\nactivity, and maximizes in the minimum phase when QS appear to be the primary\nsupplier of the ACE winds. With decreasing activity, the winds from all sources\ntend to become cooler, as represented by the increasingly low O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$\nratios. On the other hand, during each activity phase, the AR winds tend to be\nthe slowest and associated with the highest O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios, and the\nCH winds correspond to the other extreme, with the QS winds lying in between.\nApplying the same analysis method to the slow winds only, here defined as the\nwinds with speeds lower than 500 km s$^{-1}$, we find basically the same\noverall behavior, as far as the contributions of individual groups of sources\nare concerned. This statistical study indicates that QS regions are an\nimportant source of the solar wind during the minimum phase.",

The largest values of E|| are observed\nwithin double layers. The existence of double layers in the Earth's\nmagnetosphere is well documented. In our simulation their formation is\ntriggered by large parallel streaming of electrons into the reconnection\nregion. These parallel electron fluxes are required for maintaining\nquasi-neutrality of the reconnection region and increase with decreasing values\nof the normalized electron pressure upstream of the reconnection region. A\nthreshold normalized pressure is derived for strong double layers to develop.\nWe also document how the electron confinement, provided in part by the\nstructure in E||, allows sustained energization by perpendicular electric\nfields. The energization is a consequence of the confined electrons' chaotic\norbital motion that includes drifts aligned with the reconnection electric\nfield. The level of energization is proportional to the initial particle energy\nand therefore is enhanced by the initial energy boost of the acceleration\npotential, acquired by electrons entering the region. The mechanism is\neffective in an extended region of the reconnection exhaust allowing for the\ngeneration of superthermal electrons in reconnection scenarios, including those\nwith only a single x-line. An expression for the phase-space distribution of\nthe superthermal electrons is derived, providing an accurate match to the\nkinetic simulation results. The numerical and analytical results agree with\ndetailed spacecraft observations recorded during reconnection events in the\nEarth's magnetotail.",

Conventional explanations based on either shock\nacceleration of charged particles or particle acceleration due to magnetic\nreconnection at interplanetary current sheets are not persuasive. We suggest\ninstead that recurrent magnetic reconnection occurs at the HCS and smaller\ncurrent sheets in the solar wind (Zharkova & Khabarova 2012), of which a\nconsequence is particle energization by the dynamically evolving secondary\ncurrent sheets and magnetic islands (Zank et al. 2014; Drake et al. 2006a). The\neffectiveness of the trapping and acceleration process associated with magnetic\nislands depends in part on the topology of the HCS. We show that the HCS\npossesses ripples superimposed on the large-scale flat or wavy structure. We\nconjecture that the ripples can efficiently confine plasma and provide\ntokamak-like conditions that are favorable for the appearance of small-scale\nmagnetic islands that merge and/or contract. Particles trapped in the vicinity\nof merging islands and experiencing multiple small-scale reconnection events\nare accelerated by the induced electric field, and experience first-order Fermi\nacceleration in contracting magnetic islands (Zank et al. 2014). We present\nmulti-spacecraft observations of magnetic island merging and particle\nenergization in the absence of other sources, providing support for theory and\nsimulations that show particle energization by reconnection related processes\nof magnetic island merging and contraction.",

The enhancement of the IMF associated with\nFDs occurs mainly in the shock-sheath region, and the turbulence level in the\nmagnetic field is also enhanced in this region. The observed FD profiles look\nremarkably similar to the IMF enhancement profiles. The FDs typically lag the\nIMF enhancement by a few hours. The lag corresponds to the time taken by high\nenergy protons to diffuse into the magnetic field enhancement via cross-field\ndiffusion. Conclusions.

This review discusses\nthe possibility of \"extreme events,\" defined as those with magnitudes greater\nthan have been seen in the existing historical record. For most quantitative\nmeasures, this direct information does not extend more than a century and a\nhalf into the recent past. The magnitude distributions (occurrence frequencies)\nof solar events (flares/CMEs) typically decrease with the parameter measured or\ninferred (peak flux, mass, energy etc. Flare radiation fluxes tend to follow a\npower law slightly flatter than $S^{-2}$, where S represents a peak flux; solar\nparticle events (SPEs) follow a still flatter power law up to a limiting\nmagnitude, and then appear to roll over to a steeper distribution, which may\ntake an exponential form or follow a broken power law. This inference comes\nfrom the terrestrial $^{14}$C record and from the depth dependence of various\nradioisotope proxies in the lunar regolith and in meteorites. Recently major\nnew observational results have impacted our use of the relatively limited\nhistorical record in new ways: the detection of actual events in the $^{14}$C\ntree-ring records, and the systematic observations of flares and \"superflares\"\nby the Kepler spacecraft. I discuss how these new findings may affect our\nunderstanding of the distribution function expected for extreme solar events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-539b (aka Kepler object of interest\nK00372.01), a giant transiting exoplanet orbiting a solar-analogue G2 V star.\nThe mass of Kepler-539b was accurately derived thanks to a series of precise\nradial velocity measurements obtained with the CAFE spectrograph mounted on the\nCAHA 2.2m telescope. A simultaneous fit of the radial-velocity data and Kepler\nphotometry revealed that Kepler-539b is a dense Jupiter-like planet with a mass\nof Mp = 0.97 Mjup and a radius of Rp = 0.747 Rjup, making a complete circular\nrevolution around its parent star in 125.6 days. The semi-major axis of the\norbit is roughly 0.5 au, implying that the planet is at roughly 0.45 au from\nthe habitable zone. By analysing the mid-transit times of the 12 transit events\nof Kepler-539b recorded by the Kepler spacecraft, we found a clear modulated\ntransit time variation (TTV), which is attributable to the presence of a planet\nc in a wider orbit. The few timings available do not allow us to precisely\nestimate the properties of Kepler-539c and our analysis suggests that it has a\nmass between 1.2 and 3.6 Mjup, revolving on a very eccentric orbit (0.4<e<0.6)\nwith a period larger than 1000 days. The high eccentricity of planet c is the\nprobable cause of the TTV modulation of planet b. The analysis of the CAFE\nspectra revealed a relatively high photospheric lithium content, A(Li)=2.48\ndex, which, together with both a gyrochronological and isochronal analysis,\nsuggests that the parent star is relatively young.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The alignment of Saturn's magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the\nuse of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period. The period\nwas previously determined from radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft to\nbe 10h 39m 22.4s. When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of 10h 47m 6s,\nwhich was additionally found to change between sequential measurements, it\nbecame clear that the radio period could not be used to determine the bulk\nplanetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's measured wind fields\nhave increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers smaller than the\nVoyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period is thought to\nbe between 10h 32m and 10h 47m, which is unsatisfactory for such a fundamental\nproperty. Here we report a period of 10h 32m 45s +- 46s, based upon an\noptimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field and limits on\nthe observed shape and possible internal density profiles. Moreover, even when\nsolely using the constraints from its gravitational field, the rotation period\ncan be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To validate our method, we\napplied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known\nrotation period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar system contains solids of all sizes, ranging from km-size bodies to\nnano-sized particles. Nanograins have been detected in situ in the Earth's\natmosphere, near cometary and giant planet environments, and more recently in\nthe solar wind at 1 AU. These latter nano grains are thought to be formed in\nthe inner solar system dust cloud, mainly through collisional break-up of\nlarger grains and are then picked-up and accelerated by the magnetized solar\nwind because of their large charge-to-mass ratio. In the present paper, we\nanalyze the low frequency bursty noise identified in the Cassini radio and\nplasma wave data during the spacecraft cruise phase inside Jupiter's orbit. The\nmagnitude, spectral shape and waveform of this broadband noise is consistent\nwith the signature of nano particles impinging at nearby the solar wind speed\non the spacecraft surface. Nanoparticles were observed whenever the radio\ninstrument was turned on and able to detect them, at different heliocentric\ndistances between Earth and Jupiter, suggesting their ubiquitous presence in\nthe heliosphere. We analyzed the radial dependence of the nano dust flux with\nheliospheric distance and found that it is consistent with the dynamics of nano\ndust originating from the inner heliosphere and picked-up by the solar wind.\nThe contribution of the nano dust produced in asteroid belt appears to be\nnegligible compared to the trapping region in the inner heliosphere. In\ncontrast, further out, nano dust are mainly produced by the volcanism of active\nmoons such as Io and Enceladus.",

The interstellar\nmagnetic field, frozen into this plasma, then becomes draped around the\nheliopause in a characteristic manner. We derive the analytical solution for\nthis draped magnetic field in the limit of weak field intensity, assuming an\nideal potential flow around the heliopause, which we model as a Rankine\nhalf-body. We compare the structure of the model magnetic field with observed\nproperties of the IBEX ribbon and with in situ observations at the Voyager 1\nspacecraft. We find reasonable qualitative agreement, given the idealizations\nof the model. This agreement lends support to the secondary ENA model of the\nIBEX ribbon and to the interpretation that Voyager 1 has crossed the\nheliopause. We also predict that the magnetic field measured by Voyager 2 after\nit crosses the heliopause will not be significantly rotated away from the\ndirection of the undisturbed interstellar field.",
