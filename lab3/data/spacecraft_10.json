    "abstract": "Abstract:  Aims: Our goal is to develop methodologies to seamlessly track transient\nsolar wind flows viewed by coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers from rapidly\nvarying viewpoints.\nMethods: We constructed maps of intensity versus time and elongation (J-maps)\nfrom Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Wide-field Imager (WISPR) observations during the\nfourth encounter of PSP. From the J-map, we built an intensity on\nimpact-radius-on-Thomson-surface map (R-map). Finally, we constructed a\nlatitudinal intensity versus time map (Lat-map). Our methodology satisfactorily\naddresses the challenges associated with the construction of such maps from\ndata taken from rapidly varying viewpoint observations.\nResults: Our WISPR J-map exhibits several tracks, corresponding to transient\nsolar wind flows ranging from a coronal mass ejection (CME) down to streamer\nblobs. The latter occurrence rate is about 4-5 per day, which is similar to the\noccurrence rate in a J-map made from $\\sim1$ AU data obtained with the\nHeliospheric Imager-1 (HI-1) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory Ahead spacecraft (STEREO-A). STEREO-A was radially aligned with PSP\nduring the study period. The WISPR J-map tracks correspond to angular speeds of\n$2.28 \\pm 0.7$$^{\\circ}$/hour ($2.49 \\pm 0.95$$^{\\circ}$/hour), for linear\n(quadratic) time-elongation fittings, and radial speeds of about 150-300 km\ns$^{-1}$. The analysis of the Lat-map reveals a bifurcating streamer, which\nimplies that PSP was flying through a slightly folded streamer during\nperihelion.\nConclusions: We developed a framework to systematically capture and\ncharacterize transient solar wind flows from space platforms with rapidly\nvarying vantage points. The methodology can be applied to PSP WISPR\nobservations as well as to upcoming observations from instruments on board the\nSolar Orbiter mission.",

The tetrahedral configuration and\nhigh time resolution density data obtained by calibrating spacecraft potential\nallow an investigation of the turbulent density fluctuations in the solar wind\nand their three-dimensional structure in the sub-ion range. The wave-vector\nassociated with the highest energy density at each spacecraft frequency is\nobtained by application of the Multi-point signal resonator technique to the\nfour-point density data. The fluctuations show a strong wave-vector anisotropy\n$k_{\\perp}\\gg k_{\\parallel}$ where the parallel and perpendicular symbols are\nwith respect to the mean magnetic field direction. The plasma frame frequencies\nshow two populations, one below the proton cyclotron frequency\n$\\omega<\\Omega_{ci}$ consistent with kinetic Alfv\u00e9n wave (KAW) turbulence.\nThe second component has higher frequencies $\\omega > \\Omega_{ci}$ consistent\nwith ion Bernstein wave (IBW) turbulence. Alternatively, these fluctuations may\nconstitute KAWs that have undergone multiple wave-wave interactions causing a\nbroadening in the plasma frame frequencies. The scale-dependent kurtosis in\nthis wave-vector region shows a reduction in intermittency at the small scales\nwhich can also be explained by the presence of wave activity. Our results\nsuggest that small-scale turbulence exhibits linear-wave properties of kinetic\nAlfv\u00e9n and possibly ion-Bernstein/magnetosonic waves. Based on our results,\nwe speculate that these waves may play a role in describing the observed\nreduction in intermittency at sub ion scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  One of the main discoveries from the first two orbits of Parker Solar Probe\n(PSP) was the presence of magnetic switchbacks, whose deflections dominated the\nmagnetic field measurements. Determining their shape and size could provide\nevidence of their origin, which is still unclear. Previous work with a single\nsolar wind stream has indicated that these are long, thin structures although\nthe direction of their major axis could not be determined. We investigate if\nthis long, thin nature extends to other solar wind streams, while determining\nthe direction along which the switchbacks within a stream were aligned. We try\nto understand how the size and orientation of the switchbacks, along with the\nflow velocity and spacecraft trajectory, combine to produce the observed\nstructure durations for past and future orbits. We searched for the alignment\ndirection that produced a combination of a spacecraft cutting direction and\nswitchback duration that was most consistent with long, thin structures. The\nexpected form of a long, thin structure was fitted to the results of the best\nalignment direction, which determined the width and aspect ratio of the\nswitchbacks for that stream. The switchbacks had a mean width of $50,000 \\,\n\\rm{km}$, with an aspect ratio of the order of $10$. We find that switchbacks\nare not aligned along the background flow direction, but instead aligned along\nthe local Parker spiral, perhaps suggesting that they propagate along the\nmagnetic field. Since the observed switchback duration depends on how the\nspacecraft cuts through the structure, the duration alone cannot be used to\ndetermine the size or influence of an individual event. For future PSP orbits,\na larger spacecraft transverse component combined with more radially aligned\nswitchbacks will lead to long duration switchbacks becoming less common.",

Results from the calibration planner applied to a\nsubset of informed architecture designs show that a 4 sat constellation\nprovides multiple calibration opportunities within half a day planning horizon,\nfor Cubesat sensors deployed into a typical rideshare orbits.

When combined with appropriate software, this agility can\nsignificantly increase response rate, revisit time and coverage. In prior work,\nwe have demonstrated an algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics,\nattitude control and scheduling optimization to plan the time-varying,\nfull-body orientation of agile, small spacecraft in a constellation. The\nproposed schedule optimization would run at the ground station autonomously,\nand the resultant schedules uplinked to the spacecraft for execution. The\nalgorithm is generalizable over small steerable spacecraft, control capability,\nsensor specs, imaging requirements, and regions of interest. In this article,\nwe modify the algorithm to run onboard small spacecraft, such that the\nconstellation can make time-sensitive decisions to slew and capture images\nautonomously, without ground control. We have developed a communication module\nbased on Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) for onboard data management\nand routing among the satellites, which will work in conjunction with the other\nmodules to optimize the schedule of agile communication and steering. We then\napply this preliminary framework on representative constellations to simulate\ntargeted measurements of episodic precipitation events and subsequent urban\nfloods. The command and control efficiency of our agile algorithm is compared\nto non-agile (11.3x improvement) and non-DTN (21% improvement) constellations.",

Arrokoth belongs to the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt Object\npopulation that occupies dynamically undisturbed orbits around the Sun, and as\nsuch, is a primitive object that formed in situ. Therefore, whether its shape\nis primordial or evolutionary carries important implications for understanding\nthe evolution of both KBOs and potentially their dynamically derived objects,\nCentaurs and Jupiter Family Comets (JFC). Applying our mass loss driven shape\nevolution model (MONET), here we suggest that the current shape of Arrokoth\ncould be of evolutionary origin due to volatile outgassing in a timescale of\nabout 1 to 100 Myr, while its spin state would not significantly affected. We\nfurther argue that such a process may be ubiquitous in the evolution of the\nshape of KBOs shortly after their formation. This shape changing process could\nalso be reactivated when KBOs dynamically evolve to become Centaurs and then\nJFCs and receive dramatically increased solar heating.",

The comet fully disintegrated during its perihelion\npassage. Prior to that, a broadening and an increase of the intensity peak with\ndecreasing heliocentric distance was accompanied by a drop to zero polarisation\nat high phase angles (~105-135\u00b0, STEREO-B) and the emergence of negative\npolarisation at low phase angles (~25-35\u00b0, STEREO-A). Outside the\nnear-comet region, the tail exhibited a steep slope of increasing polarisation\nwith increasing cometocentric distance, with the slope showing a marked\ndecrease with decreasing heliocentric distance. The steep slope is attributed\nto sublimation of refractory organic matrix and the accompanied processing of\nthe fluffy aggregate dust grains, exposing silicates. The decrease in slope is\nlikely caused by the gradual sublimation of all refractory material closer to\nthe Sun, with resulting gases suppressing polarisation signal of the dust.\nNear-zero polarisation closer to the comet head may be explained by the same\nmechanism, stronger there due to the large amounts of material being ejected\nand sublimated from the presumably disintegrating core, which correlates with\nintensity data. Negative polarisation at small phase angles may be explained by\nthe presence of freshly ejected large silicate-rich aggregates. Despite both\nzero and negative polarisation being observed simultaneously, the two\nhypotheses on their causes are not easily reconciled. The need for further\nstudies of such comets, both observational and theoretical, is highlighted.",

However, the non-transparency of\nthe Earth's ionosphere, ionospheric distortion and artificial radio frequency\ninterference (RFI) have made it difficult to detect the VLF celestial radio\nemission with ground-based instruments. A straightforward solution to overcome\nthese problems is a space based VLF radio telescope, just like the VLF radio\ninstruments onboard the Chang'E 4 spacecraft. But building such a space\ntelescope would be inevitably costly and technically challenging. The\nalternative approach would be then a ground based VLF radio telescope.\nParticularly, in the period of post 2020 when the solar and terrestrial\nionospheric activities are expected to be in a 'calm' state, it will provide us\na good chance to perform VLF ground-based radio observations. Anticipating such\nan opportunity, we built an agile VLF radio spectrum explorer co-located with\nthe currently operational Mingantu Spectra Radio Heliograph (MUSER). The\ninstrument includes four antennas operating in the VLF frequency range 1-70\nMHz. Along with them, we employ an eight-channel analog and digital receivers\nto amplify, digitize and process the radio signals received by the antennas. We\npresent in the paper this VLF radio spectrum explorer and the instrument will\nbe useful for celestial studies of VLF radio emissions.",

We show\nthat a minimum network consisting of 9 identical spacecraft in two orbits with\ndifferent inclinations provides a good combination of sky coverage with\nseveral-degree localization accuracy with detector areas of 100 cm$^2$. In\norder to achieve this, careful attention must be paid to systematics. This\nincludes accurate photon timing ($\\sim$ 0.1 ms), good energy resolution ($\\sim$\n10\\%), and reduction of Earth albedo, which are all within current\ncapabilities. Such a network can be scaled in both the number and size of\ndetectors to produce increased accuracy. We introduce a new method of\nlocalization which does not rely on on-board trigger systems or on the\ncross-correlation of time histories, but rather, in ground processing, tests\npositions over the entire sky and assigns probabilities to them to detect and\nlocalize events. We demonstrate its capabilities with simulations.

The steep slope before 465 nm displays very distinct variations and\nmay be a proxy for the absorptions caused by the $O_2^{-}$ -> $Fe^{3+}$ or the\n$2Fe^{3+}$ -> $Fe^{2+} + Fe^{4+}$ charge transfer, if the latter are found to\nbe responsible for the drop in this spectral range. We notice several\nsimilarities between the spectral slopes and the abundance of phyllosilicates\ndetected in the infrared by the VIR, whereas no correlation can be clearly\nestablished with carbonate species.

These stars are intriguing in that the pulsations\nare inconsistent with the standard models for pulsations in hot subdwarfs,\nwhich predicts that they should display short-period pulsations rather than the\nobserved longer periods. We perform a stability analysis of the pulsation modes\nbased on data from two campaigns with K2. The highest amplitude mode is found\nto be stable with a period drift, $\\dot{P}$, of less than $1.1\\cdot10^{-9}$\ns/s.

The initial acceleration phase is characterized by a\nrapid increase in CME velocity just after eruption in the inner corona. This\nphase is followed by a non-significant residual acceleration (deceleration)\ncharacterized by an almost constant speed of CMEs. We demonstrate that the\ninitial acceleration is in the range 0.24-2616 ms-2 with median (average) value\nof 57 ms-2 (34 ms-2 ) and it takes place up to a distance of about 28 solar\nradius with median (average) value of 7.8 solar radius (6 solar radius).\nAdditionally, the initial acceleration is significant in the case of fast CMEs\n(V > 900 kms-1 ), where the median (average) values are about 295 ms-2 (251\nms-2 ), respectively, and much weaker in the case of slow CMEs (V < 250 kms-1\n), where the median (average) values are about 18 ms-2 (17 ms-2 ),\nrespectively. We note that the significant driving force (Lorentz force) can\noperate up to a distance of 6 solar radius from the Sun during the first 2\nhours of propagation. We found a significant anti-correlation between the\ninitial acceleration magnitude and the acceleration duration, whereas the\nresidual acceleration covers a range from -1224 to 0 ms-2 with a median\n(average) value of -34 ms-2 (-17 ms-2 ). One intriguing finding is that the\nresidual acceleration is much smaller during the 24th cycle in comparison to\nthe 23rd cycle of solar activity. Our study has also revealed that the\nconsidered parameters, initial acceleration (ACC INI ), residual acceleration\n(ACC RES ), maximum velocity (V MAX ), and time at maximum velocity (Time MAX )\nmostly follow solar cycles and the intensities of the individual cycle.",

It is well-known\nthat the use of linearized spacecraft rendezvous equations may not give\nsufficiently accurate results for far-field rendezvous. In particular, as the\ndistance between the active and the target spacecraft becomes significantly\ngreater than the distance between the target spacecraft and the center of\ngravity of the planet, the accuracy of linearization-based control design\napproaches may decline substantially. In this paper, we use a nonlinear state\nspace model which corresponds to more accurate description of dynamics than\nlinearized models but at the same time poses the known challenges of nonlinear\ncontrol design. To overcome these challenges, we utilize a Koopman operator\nbased approach with which the nonlinear spacecraft rendezvous dynamics is\nlifted into a higher dimensional space over which the nonlinear dynamics can be\napproximated by a linear system which is more suitable for control design\npurposes than the original nonlinear model. An Iteratively Recursive Least\nSquares (IRLS) algorithm from compressive sensing is then used to solve the\nminimum fuel control problem based on the lifted linear system. Numerical\nsimulations are performed to show the efficacy of the proposed Koopman operator\nbased approach.",

The closer the spacecraft is to\nthe Sun when it starts its outward journey, the larger the radiation pressure\nand so the larger the final velocity. For a spacecraft starting on the Earth's\norbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket\nengine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun. Employing\nthe so-called Oberth effect, a second, prograde, impulse at closest approach\nwill raise the final velocity further.

Once {\\Delta}v exceeds a threshold that depends on\nthe lightness number of the sail (a measure of its sun-induced acceleration),\nthe best strategy is to use all of the {\\Delta}v in the retrograde impulse to\ndive as close as possible to the Sun.

The\nDFD is a D -$^3$He fuelled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system.\nThis fusion propulsion concept is based on a magnetically confined field\nreversed configuration plasma, where the deuterium propellant is heated by\nfusion products, and then expanded into a magnetic nozzle, providing both\nthrust and electrical energy to the spacecraft [1]. The trajectories\ncalculations and analysis for the Titan mission are obtained based on the\ncharacteristics provided by the PPPL [1]. Two different profile missions are\nconsidered: the first one is a thrust-coast-thrust profile with constant thrust\nand specific impulse; the second scenario is a continuous and constant thrust\nprofile mission. Each mission study is divided into four different phases,\nstarting from the initial low Earth orbit departure, the interplanetary\ntrajectory, Saturn orbit insertion and the Titan orbit insertion. For all\nmission phases, maneuver time and propellant consumption are calculated. The\nresults of calculations and mission analysis offer a complete overview of the\nadvantages in term of payload mass and travel time. It is important to\nemphasize that the deceleration capability is one of the DFD game changer: in\nfact, the DFD performance allows to rapidly reach high velocities and\ndecelerate in even shorter time period. This capability results in a total trip\nduration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years\nconsidering the continuous thrust profile. The high payload enabling\ncapability, combined with the huge electrical power available from the fusion\nreactor, leads to a tremendous advantage compared to present technology.",

It was found that redder and brighter stars are spinning\nslower than the rest of the main sequence. On the theoretical side, it was\ndemonstrated that metallicity should affect the rotational evolution of stars\nas well as their evolution in the Hertzprung-R\u00fcssel or Color-Magnitude\ndiagram. In this work we combine this dataset with medium and high resolution\nspectroscopic metallicities and carefully select main sequence single stars in\na given mass range. We show that the structure seen in the CMPD also\ncorresponds to a broad correlation between metallicity and rotation, such that\nstars with higher metallicity rotate on average more slowly than those with low\nmetallicity. We compare this sample to theoretical rotational evolution models\nthat include a range of different metallicities. They predict a correlation\nbetween rotation rate and metallicity that is in the same direction and of\nabout the same magnitude as that observed. Therefore metallicity appears to be\na key parameter to explain the observed rotation period distributions. We also\ndiscuss a few different ways in which metallicity can affect the observed\ndistribution of rotation period, due to observational biases and age\ndistributions, as well as the effect on stellar wind torques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) was selected in 2012, as the\nfirst small mission in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched in\nDecember 2019. CHEOPS is a partnership between ESA and Switzerland with\nimportant contributions by ten additional ESA Member States. CHEOPS is the\nfirst mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets using ultrahigh\nprecision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a\nfollow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly dedicated to improving, whenever possible,\nexisting radii measurements or provide first accurate measurements for a subset\nof those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from\nground-based spectroscopic surveys and to following phase curves. CHEOPS will\nprovide prime targets for future spectroscopic atmospheric characterisation.\nRequirements on the photometric precision and stability have been derived for\nstars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular, CHEOPS\nshall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars in the\nmagnitude range between 6 and 9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm\nin 6 hours of integration. For K stars in the magnitude range between 9 and 12,\nCHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets achieving a\nphotometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration. This is achieved by\nusing a single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal\nplane assembly of a 33.5 cm diameter telescope. The 280 kg spacecraft has a\npointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms and orbits on a sun-synchronous\ndusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude.\nThe nominal mission lifetime is 3.5 years. During this period, 20% of the\nobserving time is available to the community through a yearly call and a\ndiscretionary time programme managed by ESA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Uncertain partially observable Markov decision processes (uPOMDPs) allow the\nprobabilistic transition and observation functions of standard POMDPs to belong\nto a so-called uncertainty set. Such uncertainty, referred to as epistemic\nuncertainty, captures uncountable sets of probability distributions caused by,\nfor instance, a lack of data available. We develop an algorithm to compute\nfinite-memory policies for uPOMDPs that robustly satisfy specifications against\nany admissible distribution. In general, computing such policies is\ntheoretically and practically intractable. We provide an efficient solution to\nthis problem in four steps. (1) We state the underlying problem as a nonconvex\noptimization problem with infinitely many constraints. (2) A dedicated\ndualization scheme yields a dual problem that is still nonconvex but has\nfinitely many constraints. (3) We linearize this dual problem and (4) solve the\nresulting finite linear program to obtain locally optimal solutions to the\noriginal problem. The resulting problem formulation is exponentially smaller\nthan those resulting from existing methods. We demonstrate the applicability of\nour algorithm using large instances of an aircraft collision-avoidance scenario\nand a novel spacecraft motion planning case study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar Orbiter is the first space mission observing the solar plasma both in\nsitu and remotely, from a close distance, in and out of the ecliptic. The\nultimate goal is to understand how the Sun produces and controls the\nheliosphere, filling the Solar System and driving the planetary environments.\nWith six remote-sensing and four in-situ instrument suites, the coordination\nand planning of the operations are essential to address the following four\ntop-level science questions: (1) What drives the solar wind and where does the\ncoronal magnetic field originate? (2) How do solar transients drive\nheliospheric variability? (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle\nradiation that fills the heliosphere? (4) How does the solar dynamo work and\ndrive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere? Maximising the mission's\nscience return requires considering the characteristics of each orbit,\nincluding the relative position of the spacecraft to Earth (affecting downlink\nrates), trajectory events (such as gravitational assist manoeuvres), and the\nphase of the solar activity cycle. Furthermore, since each orbit's science\ntelemetry will be downloaded over the course of the following orbit, science\noperations must be planned at mission level, rather than at the level of\nindividual orbits. It is important to explore the way in which those science\nquestions are translated into an actual plan of observations that fits into the\nmission, thus ensuring that no opportunities are missed. First, the overarching\ngoals are broken down into specific, answerable questions along with the\nrequired observations and the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP) is\ndeveloped to achieve this. The SAP groups objectives that require similar\nobservations into Solar Orbiter Observing Plans (SOOPs), resulting in a\nstrategic, top-level view of the optimal opportunities for science observations\nduring the mission lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Cometary meteoroid trails exist in the vicinity of comets, forming fine\nstructure of the interplanetary dust cloud. The trails consist predominantly of\ncometary particles with sizes of approximately 0.1 mm to 1 cm which are ejected\nat low speeds and remain very close to the comet orbit for several revolutions\naround the Sun. When re-analysing the Helios dust data measured in the 1970s,\nAltobelli et al. (2006) recognized a clustering of seven impacts, detected in a\nvery narrow region of space at a true anomaly angle of 135 deg, which the\nauthors considered as potential cometary trail particles. We re-analyse these\ncandidate cometary trail particles to investigate the possibility that some or\nall of them indeed originate from cometary trails and we constrain their source\ncomets. The Interplanetary Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust\nstreams in space model is a new universal model for cometary meteoroid streams\nin the inner solar system, developed by Soja et al. (2015). Using IMEX we study\ncometary trail traverses by Helios. During ten revolutions around the Sun, and\nin the narrow region of space where Helios detected the candidate dust\nparticles, the spacecraft repeatedly traversed the trails of comets\n45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajduvsakova and 72P/Denning-Fujikawa. Based on the detection\ntimes and particle impact directions, four detected particles are compatible\nwith an origin from these two comets. We find a dust spatial density in these\ntrails of about 10^-8 to 10^-7 m^-3. The in-situ detection and analysis of\nmeteoroid trail particles which can be traced back to their source bodies by\nspacecraft-based dust analysers opens a new window to remote compositional\nanalysis of comets and asteroids without the necessity to fly a spacecraft to\nor even land on those celestial bodies. This provides new science opportunities\nfor future missions like Destiny+, Europa Clipper and IMAP.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission is the first\nfocusing X-ray telescope in the hard X-ray (3-79 keV) band. Among the phenomena\nthat can be studied in this energy band, some require high time resolution and\nstability: rotation-powered and accreting millisecond pulsars, fast variability\nfrom black holes and neutron stars, X-ray bursts, and more. Moreover, a good\nalignment of the timestamps of X-ray photons to UTC is key for multi-instrument\nstudies of fast astrophysical processes. In this Paper, we describe the timing\ncalibration of the NuSTAR mission. In particular, we present a method to\ncorrect the temperature-dependent frequency response of the on-board\ntemperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Together with measurements of the\nspacecraft clock offsets obtained during downlinks passes, this allows a\nprecise characterization of the behavior of the oscillator. The calibrated\nNuSTAR event timestamps for a typical observation are shown to be accurate to a\nprecision of ~65 microsec.",

The spacecraft were close to radial alignment throughout\nthe event, with a longitudinal separation of $3.6^{\\circ}$ between Juno and the\nspacecraft near Earth. The magnetic cloud likely originated from a filament\neruption on 22 October 2011 at 00:05 UT, and caused a strong geomagnetic storm\nat Earth commencing on 24 October. Observations of the magnetic cloud at each\nspacecraft have been analysed using Minimum Variance Analysis and two flux rope\nfitting models, Lundquist and Gold-Hoyle, to give the orientation of the flux\nrope axis. We explore the effect different trailing edge boundaries have on the\nresults of each analysis method, and find a clear difference between the\norientations of the flux rope axis at the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno,\nindependent of the analysis method. The axial magnetic field strength and the\nradial width of the flux rope are calculated using both observations and\nfitting parameters and their relationship with heliocentric distance is\ninvestigated. Differences in results between the near-Earth spacecraft and Juno\nare attributed not only to the radial separation, but to the small longitudinal\nseparation which resulted in a surprisingly large difference in the in situ\nobservations between the spacecraft. This case study demonstrates the utility\nof Juno cruise data as a new opportunity to study magnetic clouds beyond 1 AU,\nand the need for caution in future radial alignment studies.",

Previous works have assumed a uniform risk allocation to cast the\noptimal control problem as a semi-definite program (SDP), which can be solved\nefficiently using standard SDP solvers. We adopt an Iterative Risk Allocation\n(IRA) formalism, which uses a two-stage approach to solve the optimal risk\nallocation problem for covariance steering. The upper-stage of IRA optimizes\nthe risk, which is proved to be a convex problem, while the lower-stage\noptimizes the controller with the new constraints. This is done iteratively so\nas to find the optimal risk allocation that achieves the lowest total cost. The\nproposed framework results in solutions that tend to maximize the terminal\ncovariance, while still satisfying the chance constraints, thus leading to less\nconservative solutions than previous methodologies. We also introduce two novel\nconvex relaxation methods to approximate quadratic chance constraints as\nsecond-order cone constraints. We finally demonstrate the approach to a\nspacecraft rendezvous problem and compare the results.",

Assuming the Sun spins-down as it ages, following\nrotation rate $\\propto$ age$^{-1/2}$, requires the current solar angular\nmomentum-loss rate to be around $6\\times 10^{30}$erg. Magnetohydrodynamic\nmodels, and previous observations of the solar wind (from the Helios and Wind\nspacecraft), generally predict a values closer to $1\\times 10^{30}$erg or\n$3\\times 10^{30}$erg, respectively. Recently, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nobserved tangential solar wind speeds as high as $\\sim50$km/s in a localized\nregion of the inner heliosphere. If such rotational flows were prevalent\nthroughout the corona, it would imply that the solar wind angular momentum-loss\nrate is an order of magnitude larger than all of those previous estimations. In\nthis letter, we evaluate the angular momentum flux in the solar wind, using\ndata from the first two orbits of PSP. The solar wind is observed to contain\nboth large positive (as seen during perihelion), and negative angular momentum\nfluxes. We analyse two solar wind streams that were repeatedly traversed by\nPSP; the first is a slow wind stream whose average angular momentum flux\nfluctuates between positive to negative, and the second is an intermediate\nspeed stream containing a positive angular momentum flux (more consistent with\na constant flow of angular momentum). When the data from PSP is evaluated\nholistically, the average equatorial angular momentum flux implies a global\nangular momentum-loss rate of around $2.6-4.2\\times 10^{30}$ erg (which is more\nconsistent with observations from previous spacecraft).",

The ion group peak\nidentifications are compared with previously proposed neutral PAHs and are\nfound to be at similar masses, supporting a PAH interpretation. The spacing\nbetween the ion group peaks is also investigated, finding a spacing of 12 or 13\nu/q indicating the addition of C or CH.

This paper aims at establishing a method\nfor modelling FGMs in molecular dynamics (MD) to get a better insight of their\nmechanical properties. In this study, the mechanical characteristics of Cu-Ni\nFGM nanowires (NW) under uniaxial loading have been investigated using the\nproposed method through MD simulations. In order to describe the inter-atomic\nforces and hence predict the properties properly, EAM (Embedded atom model)\npotential has been used. The nanowire is composed of an alloying constituent in\nthe core and the other constituent graded functionally along the outward radial\ndirection. Simple Linear and Exponential functions have been considered as the\nfunctions which defines the grading pattern. The alloying percentage on the\nsurface has been varied from 0% to 50% for both Cu-cored and Ni-cored\nnanowires. All the simulations have been carried out at 300 K. The L/D ratios\nare 10.56 and 10.67 for Cu-cored and Ni-cored NWs, respectively. This study\nsuggests that Ultimate Tensile Stress and Young's modulus increase with\nincreasing surface Ni percentage in Cu-cored NWs. However, in Ni-cored NWs\nthese values decrease with the increase of surface Cu percentage. Also, for the\nsame surface percentage of Ni in Cu-cored NW, the values are higher in linearly\ngraded FGMs than that in exponentially graded FGMs. While in Ni-cored NWs,\nexponentially graded FGM shows higher values of UTS and E than those in\nlinearly graded FGM. Thus, grading functions and surface percentages can be\nused as parameters for modulating the mechanical properties of FGM nanowires.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Asteroid Impacts pose a major threat to all life on the Earth. Deflecting the\nasteroid from the impact trajectory is an important way to mitigate the threat.\nA kinetic impactor remains to be the most feasible method to deflect the\nasteroid. However, due to the constraint of the launch capability, an impactor\nwith the limited mass can only produce a very limited amount of velocity\nincrement for the asteroid. In order to improve the deflection efficiency of\nthe kinetic impactor strategy, this paper proposed a new concept called the\nAssembled Kinetic Impactor (AKI), which is combining the spacecraft with the\nlaunch vehicle final stage. By making full use of the mass of the launch\nvehicle final stage, the mass of the impactor will be increased, which will\ncause the improvement of the deflection efficiency. According to the technical\ndata of Long March 5 (CZ-5) launch vehicle, the missions of deflecting Bennu\nare designed to demonstrate the power of the AKI concept. Simulation results\nshow that, compared with the Classic Kinetic Impactor (CKI, performs\nspacecraft-rocket separation), the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle\nfinal stage can increase the deflection distance to more than 3 times, and\nreduce the launch lead-time by at least 15 years. With the requirement of the\nsame deflection distance, the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle final\nstage can reduce the number of launches to 1/3 of that of the number of CKI\nlaunches. The AKI concept makes it possible to defend Bennu-like large\nasteroids by a no-nuclear technique within 10-year launch lead-time. At the\nsame time, for a single CZ-5, the deflection distance of a 140 m diameter\nasteroid within 10-year launch lead-time, can be increased from less than 1\nEarth radii to more than 1 Earth radii.",

The ejecta regions are divided into two broad\nclasses: magnetic clouds (MC) that exhibit the characteristics of magnetic flux\nropes and non-magnetic clouds (NMC) that do not. As CMEs result from eruption\nof magnetic flux ropes, it is important to answer why NMCs do not have the flux\nrope features. One claims that NMCs lose their original flux rope features due\nto the interactions between ICMEs or ICMEs and other large scale structures\nduring their transit in the heliosphere. The other attributes this phenomenon\nto the geometric selection effect, i.e., when an ICME has its nose (flank,\nincluding leg and non-leg flanks) pass through the observing spacecraft, the MC\n(NMC) features will be detected along the spacecraft trajectory within the\nejecta. In this Letter, we examine which explanation is more reasonable through\nthe geometric properties of ICMEs. If the selection effect leads to different\nejecta types, MCs should have narrower sheath region compared to NMCs from the\nstatistical point of view, which is confirmed by our statistics. Besides, we\nfind that NMCs have the similar size in solar cycles 23 and 24, and NMCs are\nsmaller than MCs in cycle 23 but larger than MCs in cycle 24. This suggests\nthat most NMCs have their leg flank pass through the spacecraft. Our geometric\nanalyses support that all ICMEs should have a magnetic flux rope structure near\n1 AU.",

In this work, we\nexplore additional constraints on the initial conditions of the pre-impact\nlunar sediment required in order to produce a plume model that is consistent\nwith the ground-based observations. We match the observed debris plume\nlightcurve using a layer of dirty ice with an ice concentration that increases\nwith depth, a layer of pure regolith, and a layer of material at about 6 meters\nbelow the lunar surface that would otherwise have been visible in the plume but\nhas a high enough tensile strength to resist excavation. Among a few possible\nmaterials, a mixture of regolith and ice with a sufficiently high ice\nconcentration could plausibly produce such a behavior. The vertical albedo\nprofiles used in the best fit model allows us to calculate a pre-impact mass of\nwater ice within Cabeus crater of $5 \\pm 3.0 \\times 10^{11}$ kg and a mass\nconcentration of water in the lunar sediment of $8.2 \\pm 0.001$ %wt, assuming a\nwater ice albedo of 0.8 and a lunar regolith density of 1.5 g cm$^{-3}$, or a\nmass concentration of water of $4.3 \\pm 0.01$ %wt, assuming a lunar regolith\ndensity of 3.0. These models fit to ground-based observations result in derived\nmasses of regolith and water ice within the debris plume that are consistent\nwith \\emph{in situ} measurements, with a model debris plume ice mass of 108 kg.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Turbulence, a ubiquitous phenomenon in interplanetary space, is crucial for\nthe energy conversion of space plasma at multiple scales. This work focuses on\nthe propagation, polarization and wave composition properties of the solar wind\nturbulence within 0.3AU, and its variation with heliocentric distances at MHD\nscales (from 10s to 1000s in the spacecraft frame). We present the probability\ndensity function of propagation wavevectors (${\\rm{PDF}}(k_\\parallel,k_\\perp)$)\nfor solar wind turbulence winthin 0.3 AU for the first time: (1) wavevectors\ncluster quasi-(anti-)parallel to the local background magnetic field for\n$kd_{\\rm i}<0.02$, where $d_{\\rm i}$ is the ion inertial length; (2)\nwavevectors shift to quasi-perpendicular directions for $kd_{\\rm i}>0.02$.\nBased on our wave composition diagnosis, we find that: the outward/anti-sunward\nAlfv\u00e9n mode dominates over the whole range of scales and distances, the\nspectral energy density fraction of the inward/sunward fast mode decreases with\ndistance, and the fractional energy densities of the inward and outward slow\nmode increase with distance. The outward fast mode and inward Alfv\u00e9n mode\nrepresent minority populations throughout the explored range of distances and\nscales. On average, the degree of anisotropy of the magnetic fluctuations\ndefined with respect to the minimum variation direction decreases with\nincreasing scale, with no trend in distance at all scales. Our results provide\ncomprehensive insight into the scenario of transport and transfer of the solar\nwind fluctuations/turbulence in the inner heliosphere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Mission designers must study many dynamical models to plan a low-cost\nspacecraft trajectory that satisfies mission constraints. They routinely use\nPoincar\u00e9 maps to search for a suitable path through the interconnected web of\nperiodic orbits and invariant manifolds found in multi-body gravitational\nsystems. This paper is concerned with the extraction and interactive visual\nexploration of this structural landscape to assist spacecraft trajectory\nplanning. We propose algorithmic solutions that address the specific challenges\nposed by the characterization of the topology in astrodynamics problems and\nallow for an effective visual analysis of the resulting information. This\nvisualization framework is applied to the circular restricted three-body\nproblem (CR3BP), where it reveals novel periodic orbits with their relevant\ninvariant manifolds in a suitable format for interactive transfer selection.\nRepresentative design problems illustrate how spacecraft path planners can\nleverage our topology visualization to fully exploit the natural dynamics\npathways for energy-efficient trajectory designs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Spacecraft potential has often been used to infer electron density with much\nhigher time resolution than is typically possible with plasma instruments.\nHowever, recently two studies by Torkar et al. 2017 and Graham et al. 2018 have\nshown that external electric fields can also have an effect on the spacecraft\npotential by enhancing photoelectron escape from the surface. Consequently,\nshould the electron density derived from the spacecraft potential be used\nduring an event with a large electric field, the estimation would be\ncontaminated and the user would see the effects of the electric field rather\nthan density perturbations. The goal of this paper is to propose a method to\nremove the electric field effects to allow the density derived from spacecraft\npotential to be used even during large amplitude wave events such as Langmuir\nwaves or upper hybrid waves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The zeroth law of turbulence states that, for fixed energy input into\nlarge-scale motions, the statistical steady state of a turbulent system is\nindependent of microphysical dissipation properties. The behavior, which is\nfundamental to nearly all fluid-like systems from industrial processes to\ngalaxies, occurs because nonlinear processes generate smaller and smaller\nscales in the flow, until the dissipation -- no matter how small -- can\nthermalize the energy input. Using direct numerical simulations and theoretical\narguments, we show that in strongly magnetized plasma turbulence such as that\nrecently observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft, the zeroth law is\nroutinely violated. Namely, when such turbulence is \"imbalanced\" -- when the\nlarge-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating in one\ndirection (the most common situation in space plasmas) -- nonlinear\nconservation laws imply the existence of a \"barrier\" at scales near the ion\ngyroradius. This causes energy to build up over time at large scales. The\nresulting magnetic-energy spectra bear a strong similarity to those observed in\nsitu, exhibiting a sharp, steep kinetic transition range above and around the\nion-Larmor scale, with flattening at yet smaller scales, thus resolving the\ndecade-long puzzle of the position and variability of ion-kinetic spectral\nbreaks in plasma turbulence. The \"barrier\" effect also suggests that how a\nplasma is forced at large scales (the imbalance) may have a crucial influence\non thermodynamic properties such as the ion-to-electron heating ratio.",
