The goal of this work was to use\nGORID's particle data to identify and separate the space debris to\ninterplanetary dust particles (IDPs) in GEO, to more finely determine the\ninstrument's measurement characteristics and to derive impact fluxes. While the\nphysical characteristics of the GORID impacts alone are insufficient for a\nreliable distinction between debris and interplanetary dust, the temporal\nbehavior of the impacts are strong enough indicators to separate the\npopulations based on clustering. Non-cluster events are predominantly\ninterplanetary, while cluster events are debris. The GORID mean flux\ndistributions (at mass thresholds which are impact speed dependent) for IDPs,\ncorrected for dead time, are 1.35x10^{-4} m^{-2} s^{-1} using a mean detection\nrate: 0.54 d^{-1}, and for space debris are 6.1x10^{-4} m^{-2} s^{-1} using a\nmean detection rate: 2.5 d^{-1}.

The steady-state cascades, of waves traveling in\nopposite directions along the mean magnetic field, carry unequal energy fluxes\nto small length scales, where they decay due to viscous and resistive\ndissipation. The inertial-range scalings are well-understood when both cascades\nare weak. We study the case when both cascades are, in a sense, strong. The\ninertial-range of this imbalanced cascade has the following properties: (i) the\nratio of the r.m.s. Elsasser amplitudes is independent of scale, and is equal\nto the ratio of the corresponding energy fluxes; (ii) in common with the\nbalanced strong cascade, the energy spectra of both Elsasser waves are of the\nanisotropic Kolmogorov form, with their parallel correlation lengths equal to\neach other on all scales, and proportional to the two-thirds power of the\ntransverse correlation length; (iii) the equality of cascade time and\nwaveperiod (critical balance) that characterizes the strong balanced cascade\ndoes not apply to the Elsasser field with the larger amplitude. Instead, the\nmore general criterion that always applies to both Elsasser fields is that the\ncascade time is equal to the correlation time of the straining imposed by\noppositely-directed waves. Our results are particularly relevant for turbulence\nin the solar wind. Spacecraft measurements have established that, in the\ninertial range of solar wind turbulence, waves travelling away from the sun\nhave higher amplitudes than those travelling towards it. Result (i) allows us\nto infer the turbulent flux ratios from the amplitude ratios, thus providing\ninsight into the origin of the turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present direct evidence that magnetic clouds (MCs) have highly flattened\nand curved cross section resulting from their interaction with the ambient\nsolar wind. Lower limits on the transverse size are obtained for three MCs\nobserved by ACE and Ulysses from the latitudinal separation between the two\nspacecraft, ranging from 40$^{\\circ}$ to 70$^{\\circ}$. The cross-section aspect\nratio of the MCs is estimated to be no smaller than $6:1$. We offer a simple\nmodel to extract the radius of curvature of the cross section, based on the\nelevation angle of the MC normal distributed over latitude. Application of the\nmodel to Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 (close to solar minimum) shows that\nthe cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with a\nradius of curvature of $\\sim$ 0.3 AU. Near solar maximum, MCs tend to be convex\noutward in the solar wind with a uniform speed; the radius of curvature is\nproportional to the heliographic distance of MCs, as demonstrated by Ulysses\nobservations between 1999 and 2003. These results improve our knowledge of the\nglobal morphology of MCs in the pre-Stereo era, which is crucial for space\nweather prediction and heliosphere studies.",

This camera\nhas two channels covering the 60 to 210 microns wavelength range. The focal\nplane of the short wavelength channel is made of a mosaic of 2x4 3-sides\nbuttable bolometer arrays (16x16 pixels each) for a total of 2048 pixels, while\nthe long wavelength channel has a mosaic of 2 of the same bolometer arrays for\na total of 512 pixels. The 10 arrays have been fabricated, individually tested\nand integrated in the photometer. They represent the first filled arrays of\nfully collectively built bolometers with a cold multiplexed readout, allowing\nfor a properly sampled coverage of the full instrument field of view. The\ncamera has been fully characterized and the ground calibration campaign will\ntake place after its delivery to the PACS consortium in mid 2006. The\nbolometers, working at a temperature of 300 mK, have a NEP close to the BLIP\nlimit and an optical bandwidth of 4 to 5 Hz that will permit the mapping of\nlarge sky areas. This paper briefly presents the concept and technology of the\ndetectors as well as the cryocooler and the warm electronics.

The eclipse depths are 0.28 and 0.16 mag,\nand show that the two eclipsing components of Psi Cen have very different\nradii. As a consequence, the secondary eclipse is total. We find the\neccentricity to be e=0.55 with an orbital period of 38.8 days from combining\nthe WIRE light curve with data taken over two years from the Solar Mass\nEjection Imager camera. We have fitted the light curve with EBOP and have\nassessed the uncertainties of the resulting parameters using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The fractional radii of the stars and the inclination of the orbit\nhave random errors of only 0.1% and 0.01 degrees, respectively, but the\nsystematic uncertainty in these quantities may be somewhat larger.

The Assembly of\nGalaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,\nmetals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from\nthe epoch of reionization to the present day. The Birth of Stars and\nProtoplanetary Systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution of\nstars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary\nsystems. The Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme seeks to determine\nthe physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own,\nand investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. To\nenable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package,\na spacecraft and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments,\nsome of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment\non-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The JWST\noperations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the\nmajority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international\nastronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.",

A partially\nactive or fully active anti-coincidence shield/collimator with a total area of\nbetween 15 and 35 square meters will be used to define the field of view of the\nCZT detectors and to suppress the background of cosmic-ray-induced events. In\nthis paper, we describe the use of a sodium activated cesium iodide\nshield/collimator to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and to measure their energy\nspectra in the energy range from 100 keV up to 10 MeV. We use the code GEANT4\nto simulate the interactions of photons and cosmic rays with the spacecraft and\ninstrument and the code DETECT2000 to simulate the optical properties of the\nscintillation detectors. The shield collimator achieves a nu-F-nu sensitivity\nof 3 x 10^(-9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) and 2 x 10^(-8) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) at 100 keV\nand 600 keV, respectively. The sensitivity is well matched to that of the coded\nmask telescope. The broad energy coverage of an EXIST-type mission with active\nshields will constrain the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) for a\nlarge number of GRBs. The measurement of the SED peak may be key for\ndetermining photometric GRB redshifts and for using GRBs as cosmological\nprobes.",

Various missions aimed at improving such limits by several orders\nof magnitude have more or less recently been proposed like LATOR, ASTROD,\nBepiColombo and GAIA. They involve the use of various spacecraft, to be\nlaunched along interplanetary trajectories, for measuring the effects of the\nsolar gravity on the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In this paper we\ninvestigate what is needed to measure the combination nu=(2+2gamma-beta)/3 of\nthe post-Newtonian gravitoelectric Einstein perigee precession of a test\nparticle to an accuracy of about 10^-5 with a pair of drag-free spacecraft in\nthe Earth's gravitational field. It turns out that the latest gravity models\nfrom the dedicated CHAMP and GRACE missions would allow to reduce the\nsystematic error of gravitational origin just to this demanding level of\naccuracy. In regard to the non-gravitational errors, the spectral noise density\nof the drag-free sensors required to reach such level of accuracy would amounts\nto 10^-8-10^-9 cm s^-2 Hz^-1/2 over very low frequencies. Although not yet\nobtainable with the present technologies, such level of compensation is much\nless demanding than those required for, e.g., LISA. As a by-product, an\nindependent measurement of the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring\neffect with a 0.9% accuracy would be possible as well. The forthcoming Earth\ngravity models from CHAMP and GRACE will further reduce the systematic\ngravitational errors in both of such tests.",

When all three spacecraft observe a burst, the result\nis an error box whose area varies between 1 and 48000 square arcminutes,\nresulting in an average reduction of the BATSE error circle area of a factor of\n87.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  As the data from space missions and laboratories improve, a research domain\ncombining plasmas and charged dust is gaining in prominence. Our solar system\nprovides many natural laboratories such as planetary rings, comet comae and\ntails, ejecta clouds around moons and asteroids, and Earth's noctilucent clouds\nfor which to closely study plasma-embedded cosmic dust. One natural laboratory\nto study electromagnetically-controlled cosmic dust has been provided by the\nJovian dust streams and the data from the instruments which were on board the\nGalileo spacecraft. Given the prodigious quantity of dust poured into the\nJovian magnetosphere by Io and its volcanoes resulting in the dust streams, the\npossibility of dusty plasma conditions exist. This paper characterizes the main\nparameters for those interested in studying dust embedded in a plasma with a\nfocus on the Jupiter environment. I show how to distinguish between\ndust-in-plasma and dusty-plasma and how the Havnes parameter P can be used to\nsupport or negate the possibility of collective behavior of the dusty plasma.\nThe result of applying these tools to the Jovian dust streams reveals mostly\ndust-in-plasma behavior. In the orbits displaying the highest dust stream\nfluxes, portions of orbits E4, G7, G8, C21 satisfy the minimum requirements for\na dusty plasma. However, the P parameter demonstrates that these mild dusty\nplasma conditions do not lead to collective behavior of the dust stream\nparticles.",

This non-stationary gravitational field of the Sun is\nassociated with the Lorentz transformation of the metric tensor and the affine\nconnection from the heliocentric to the barycentric frame of the solar system\nand can be treated as gravimagnetic field.\nThe gravimagnetic field perturbs the propagation of a radio wave and\ncontributes to its frequency shift at the level up to 4 10^{-13} that may\naffect the precise measurement of the parameter gamma in the Cassini experiment\nto about one part in 10,000.

Although in principle the\nphoton-limited precision of the STIS data should allow us to measure the timing\nof individual transits to a precision of 2-7 s, we find that systematic\ninstrumental offsets in the measured flux from one orbit of the spacecraft to\nthe next degrade these measurements to a typical precision of +/- 14 s.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Optimal control problems are formulated and efficient computational\nprocedures are proposed for combined orbital and rotational maneuvers of a\nrigid body in three dimensions. The rigid body is assumed to act under the\ninfluence of forces and moments that arise from a potential and from control\nforces and moments. The key features of this paper are its use of computational\nprocedures that are guaranteed to preserve the geometry of the optimal\nsolutions. The theoretical basis for the computational procedures is\nsummarized, and examples of optimal spacecraft maneuvers are presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  If the Pioneer anomaly has a gravitational origin, it would, according to the\nequivalence principle, distort the motions of the planets in the Solar System.\nSince no anomalous motion of the planets has been detected, it is generally\nbelieved that the Pioneer anomaly can not originate from a gravitational source\nin the Solar System. However, this conclusion becomes less obvious when\nconsidering models that either imply modifications to gravity at long range or\ngravitational sources localized to the outer Solar System, given the\nuncertainty in the orbital parameters of the outer planets. Following the\ngeneral assumption that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a\nspherically symmetric spacetime metric, we derive the metric disturbance that\nis needed in order to account for the Pioneer anomaly. We then analyze the\nresidual effects on the astronomical observables of the three outer planets\nthat would arise from this metric disturbance, given an arbitrary metric theory\nof gravity. Providing a method for comparing the computed residuals with actual\nresiduals, our results imply that the presence of a perturbation to the\ngravitational field necessary to induce the Pioneer anomaly is in conflict with\navailable data for the planets Uranus and Pluto, but not for Neptune. We\ntherefore conclude that the motion of the Pioneer spacecraft must be\nnon-geodesic. Since our results are model independent within the class of\nmetric theories of gravity, they can be applied to rule out any model of the\nPioneer anomaly that implies that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a\nperturbed spacetime metric, regardless of the origin of this metric\ndisturbance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Today, the motion of spacecrafts is still described according to the\nclassical Newtonian equations plus the so-called \"relativistic corrections\",\ncomputed with the required precision using the Post-(Post-)Newtonian formalism.\nThe current approach, with the increase of tracking precision (Ka-Band Doppler,\ninterplanetary lasers) and clock stabilities (atomic fountains) is reaching its\nlimits in terms of complexity, and is furthermore error prone. In the\nappropriate framework of General Relativity, we study a method to numerically\nintegrate the native relativistic equations of motion for a weak gravitational\nfield, also taking into account small non-gravitational forces. The latter are\ntreated as perturbations, in the sense that we assume that both the local\nstructure of space-time is not modified by these forces, and that the\nunperturbed satellite motion follows the geodesics of the local space-time. The\nuse of a symplectic integrator to compute the unperturbed geodesic motion\ninsures the constancy of the norm of the proper velocity quadrivector. We\nfurther show how this general relativistic framework relates to the classical\none.",
