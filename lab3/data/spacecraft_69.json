    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Cluster Wideband Data instrument has been used to determine the locations\nof auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) using very long baseline interferometry.\nThe technique involves cross-correlating individual AKR bursts from all six\nCluster baselines using time and frequency filtered waveforms. We report the\nlocations of over 1,700 individual AKR bursts during six observing epochs\nbetween 10 July 2002 and 22 January 2003 when the Cluster constellation was\nhigh above the southern or northern hemisphere. In general we find that the AKR\nburst locations lie along magnetic field lines which map onto the nighttime\nauroral zone as expected from previous AKR studies. The distribution of AKR\nauroral footprint locations at each epoch had a overall spatial scale between\n1000 - 2000 km, much larger than the positional uncertainty of an individual\nAKR burst location magnetic footprint, but a small fraction of the auroral\noval. For two of the six epochs, there was a significant drift in the mean\nlocation of AKR activity over a period of 1-2 hours. The drift was\npredominantly in latitude at one epoch and in longitude at the other, with\naverage drift speed V ~ 80-90 m s-1 at the AKR emission location.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A phase-locking configuration for LISA is proposed that provides a\nsignificantly simpler mode of operation. The scheme provides one Sagnac signal\nreadout inherently insensitive to laser frequency noise and optical bench\nmotion for a non-rotating LISA array. This Sagnac output is also insensitive to\nclock noise, requires no time shifting of data, nor absolute arm length\nknowledge. As all measurements are made at one spacecraft, neither clock\nsynchronization nor exchange of phase information between spacecraft is\nrequired. The phase-locking configuration provides these advantages for only\none Sagnac variable yet retains compatibility with the baseline approach for\nobtaining the other TDI variables. The orbital motion of the LISA constellation\nis shown to produce a 14 km path length difference between the\ncounter-propagating beams in the Sagnac interferometer. With this length\ndifference a laser frequency noise spectral density of 1 Hz/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$\nwould consume the entire optical path noise budget of the Sagnac variables. A\nsignificant improvement of laser frequency stability (currently at 30\nHz/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$) would be needed for full-sensitivity LISA operation in the\nSagnac mode. Alternatively, an additional level of time-delay processing could\nbe applied to remove the laser frequency noise. The new time-delayed\ncombinations of the phase measurements are presented.",

Sensitivity\ncurves are presented for SyZyGys having various arm-lengths. A number of\ntechnical simplifications result from the linear configuration. These include\nonly one faceted (e.g., cubical) proof mass per spacecraft, intra-spacecraft\nlaser metrology needed only at the central spacecraft, placement in a single\nappropriate orbit can reduce Doppler drifts so that no laser beam modulation is\nrequired for ultra-stable oscillator noise calibration, and little or no\ntime-dependent articulation of the telescopes to maintain pointing. Because\nSyZyGy's sensitivity falls off more sharply at low frequency than that of an\nequilateral triangular array, it may be more useful for GW observations in the\nband between those of ground-based interferometers (10-2000 Hz) and LISA (.1\nmHz-.1 Hz).

We discuss the\ntheoretical possibilities to use low-frequency spacecraft arrays to detect\nsignals from magnetized extrasolar planets, including earthlike ones. A major\nuncertainty that prohibits us from knowing if it is possible to detect\nexoplanet cyclotron maser signals is the incomplete knowledge of the properties\nof the interstellar plasma.\nWe also present some ideas of how to construct efficient and affordable\nspace-based radio telescopes. We discuss two possibilities, a log-periodic\nantenna in the spin plane and a two-spacecraft concept where one spacecraft\nholds a large parabolic wire mesh reflector and the other one contains the\nreceiver. In the latter case, the effective area could be of the order of 1\nkm$^2$.

The majority of the dust particles have been sensed at altitudes\nbelow five radii of these lunar-sized satellites. We identify the particles in\nthe dust clouds surrounding the moons by their impact direction, impact\nvelocity, and mass distribution. Average particle sizes are 0.5 to $\\rm 1 \\mu\nm$, just above the detector threshold, indicating a size distribution with\ndecreasing numbers towards bigger particles. Our results imply that the\nparticles have been kicked up by hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids onto\nthe satellites' surfaces. The measured radial dust density profiles are\nconsistent with predictions by dynamical modeling for satellite ejecta produced\nby interplanetary impactors (Krivov et al., PSS, 2003, 51, 251--269), assuming\nyield, mass and velocity distributions of the ejecta from laboratory\nmeasurements. The dust clouds of the three outer Galilean moons have very\nsimilar properties and are in good agreement with the model predictions for\nsolid ice-silicate surfaces. The dust density in the vicinity of Io, however,\nis more than an order of magnitude lower than expected from theory. This may be\ndue to a softer, fluffier surface of Io (volcanic deposits) as compared to the\nother moons. The log-log slope of the dust number density in the clouds vs.\ndistance from the satellite center ranges between --1.6 and --2.8. Appreciable\nvariations of number densities obtained from individual flybys with varying\ngeometry, especially at Callisto, might be indicative of leading-trailing\nasymmetries of the clouds due to the motion of the moons with respect to the\nfield of impactors.",

The spacecraft is\nbased on the dynamic Casimir effect, in which electromagnetic radiation is\nemitted when an uncharged mirror is properly accelerated in the vacuum. The\nradiative reaction produces a dissipative force on the mirror that tends to\nresist the acceleration of the mirror. This force can be used to accelerate a\nspacecraft attached to the mirror. We also show that, in principal, one could\nobtain the power to operate the accelerated mirror in such a spacecraft using\nenergy extracted from the quantum vacuum using the standard Casimir effect\nwitha parallel plate geometry. Unfortunately the method as currently conceived\ngenerates a miniscule thrust, and is no more practical than a spacewarp, yet it\ndoes provide an interesting demonstration of our current understanding of the\nphysics of the quantized electromagnetic field in vacuum.",

MIRAX is an international collaboration that includes, besides\nINPE, the University of California San Diego, the University of Tuebingen in\nGermany, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Space Research\nOrganization Netherlands. The payload of MIRAX will consist in two identical\nhard X-ray cameras (10 -200 keV) and one soft X-ray camera (2-28 keV), both\nwith angular resolution of ~ 5-6 arcmin. The basic objective of MIRAX is to\ncarry out continuous broadband imaging spectroscopy observations of a large\nsource sample (~ 9 months/yr) in the central Galactic plane region. This will\nallow the detection, localization, possible identification, and\nspectral/temporal study of the entire history of transient phenomena to be\ncarried out in one single mission. MIRAX will have sensitivities of ~ 5\nmCrab/day in the 2-10 keV band (~2 times better than the All Sky Monitor on\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer) and 2.6 mCrab/day in the 10-100 keV band (~40\ntimes better than the Earth Occultation technique of the Burst and Transient\nSource Experiment on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory). The MIRAX spacecraft\nwill weigh about 200 kg and is expected to be launched in a low-altitude (~ 600\nkm) circular equatorial orbit around 2007/2008.",

We use the asymptotic scheme of PN approximation, that expands all\nfields. We find that the PN acceleration A of the small body keeps a\nstructure-dependent part at this limit. In particular, if the only massive body\nis static and spherical, then A differs from the PN acceleration of a test\nparticle in a Schwarzschild field only by this structure-dependent part. The\npresence of the latter is due to the fact that the PN metric depends on the\nfirst spatial derivatives of the Newtonian potential. Since just the same form\nof PN metric is valid for the standard form of Schwarzschild's solution, the\nacceleration of a small body might keep a structure-dependent part at the point\nlimit in general relativity also, depending on the gauge. The magnitude of the\nstructure-dependent acceleration is already challenging on Earth. For the\nPioneer spacecrafts, it is likely to discard the current version of the scalar\ntheory.

These conundrums may be resolved in the theory of Self Creation\nCosmology, in which the Principle of Mutual Interaction subsumes both Mach's\nPrinciple and the Local Conservation of Energy. The theory is conformally\nequivalent to General Relativity in vacuo with the consequence that predictions\nof the theory are identical with General Relativity in the standard solar\nsystem experiments. Other observable local and cosmological consequences offer\nan explanation for the anomalies above. The SCC universe expands linearly in\nits Einstein Frame and it is static in its Jordan Frame; hence, as there are no\ndensity, smoothness or horizon problems, there is no requirement for Inflation.\nThe theory determines the total density parameter to be one third, and the cold\ndark matter density parameter to be two ninths, yet in the Jordan frame the\nuniverse is similar to Einstein's original static cylindrical model and\nspatially flat. Therefore there is no need for a 'Dark Energy' hypothesis. As\nthe field equations determine the false vacuum energy density to be a specific,\nand feasibly small, value there is no 'Lambda Problem'. Finally certain\nobservations in SCC would detect cosmic acceleration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  WXM gives GRB localizations in instrument coordinates. WXM localizations must\nbe converted to celestial coordinates using spacecraft aspect information\nobtained by the optical cameras on HETE. We must therefore accurately determine\nthe alignment of the WXM boresight with respect to that of the optical cameras,\nin order to accurately determine the celestial coordinates of WXM burst\nlocations. We use a seven-parameter model that treats as free parameters the\nthree Euler angles of a pure rotation, two horizontal shifts of the\ncoded-aperture masks with respect to the detectors, and the heights of the\nmasks above the two detectors. We determine the alignment by fitting the model\nto a set of 252 WXM localizations of Sco X-1 obtained between 23 April and 28\nJune 2001. We estimate the systematic error in WXM GRB locations by comparing\nthe actual and the calculated locations of Sco X-1. We find that the systematic\nerror corresponding to a 68.3% confidence region is 1.7$'$, and the systematic\nerror corresponding to a 90% confidence region is 2.4$'$. We find that this\nastrometric solution also provides a satisfactory fit to an independent sample\nof SGR and XRB events. These results are consistent with the astrometric\ncalibration and the systematic error in WXM localizations derived independently\nusing the RIKEN localization method.",

The error is due to a residual\nmisalignment of the two instruments with respect to the spacecraft Z axis\narisen from the presence of attitude inaccuracies in the observations used to\ncalibrate the pointing direction of LECS and MECS optical axes. Analytical\nformulae to correct LECS and MECS sky coordinates are derived. After the\ncoordinate correction the 90% confidence level error radii are 16'' and 17''\nfor LECS and MECS respectively, improving by a factor of ~2 the source location\naccuracy of the two instruments.

I confirm that an apparent anomalous acceleration is\nacting on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which is not accounted for by present\nphysical models of spacecraft navigation. My best fit value for the\nacceleration, including corrections for systematic biases and uncertainties, is\n(8.60 +/- 1.34) x 10^{-8} cm s^{-2}, directed towards the Sun. This value\ncompares favorably to previous results. I examine the robustness of my result\nto various perturbations of the analysis method, and find agreement to within\n+/- 5%. The anomalous acceleration is reasonably constant with time, with a\ncharacteristic variation time scale of > 70 yr.

The EUV data interpretation,\nin particular, has suffered because of inadequate neutral hydrogen-plasma\nmodels, difficulty of calculating the multiply scattered Lyman alpha glow and\ncalibration uncertainties. Recently, all these difficulties have been\nsignificantly reduced. In the present work we have used the latest state of the\nart supersonic VLISM neutral hydrogen-plasma and Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nmodel, incorporating neutral density, temperature, and velocity variations,\nactual solar line shape, realistic redistribution function, Doppler and\naberration effects. This work presents the methodology of the radiative\ntransfer code and the first results of the comparison of the model predictions\nwith the Pioneer 10 data. Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations were\ncarried out for five neutral hydrogen- plasma models and compared with Pioneer\ndata. The first results are quite encouraging. We found that the VLISM\nionization ratio is between 0.2 and 0.5 and that the VLISM neutral hydrogen\ndensity is less than 0.25 cm^{-3}. The present calculation suggests that the\nPioneer 10 photometer derived intensities (Rayleighs) need to be increased by a\nfactor of 2. If this model- derived calibration is used then the difference\nbetween Pioneer 10 and Voyager 2 intensity values is reduced to about 2.2. The\nmodel, neutral hydrogen density = 0.15 cm${-3} and proton density = 0.07\ncm^{-3}, is found to best fit the Pioneer 10 data.",

We discuss the internal-dissipation-caused\nrelaxation of a freely precessing rotator towards its minimal-energy mode (mode\nthat corresponds to the spin about the maximal-inertia axis). While the body\nnutates at some rate, the internal stresses and strains within the body\noscillate at frequencies both higher and lower than this rate. The internal\ndissipation takes place mostly the second and higher harmonics. We discuss the\napplication of our findings to asteroids. Regarding the comets, estimates show\nthat the currently available angular resolution of spacecraft-based instruments\nmakes it possible to observe wobble damping within year- or maybe even\nmonth-long spans of time. We also discuss cosmic-dust astrophysics; in\nparticular, the role played by precession damping in the dust alignment. We\nshow that this damping provides coupling of the grain's rotational and\nvibrational degrees of freedom; this entails occasional flipping of dust grains\ndue to thermal fluctuations. During such a flip, grain preserves its angular\nmomentum, but the direction of torques arising from H2 formation reverses. As a\nresult, flipping grain will not rotate fast in spite of the action of\nuncompensated H2 formation torques. The grains get ``thermally trapped,'' and\ntheir alignment is marginal.",

The key science objectives of XEUS are: Search for\nthe origin, and subsequent study of growth, of the first massive black holes in\nthe early Universe; assessment of the formation of the first gravitationally\nbound dark matter dominated systems and their evolution; study of the evolution\nof metal synthesis up till the present epoch; characterization of the true\nintergalactic medium.\nTo reach these ambitious science goals the two salient characteristics of the\nXEUS observatory entail: (1) Its effective spectroscopic grasp, combining a\nsensitive area > 20 m^2 below 2 keV with a spectral resolution better than 2\neV. This allows significant detection of the most prominent X-ray emission\nlines (e.g. O-VII, Si-XIII and Fe-XXV) in cosmologically distant sources\nagainst the sky background; (2) Its angular resolving power, between 2 and 5\narc seconds, to minimize source confusion as well as noise due to the galactic\nX-ray foreground emission.\nTo accommodate these instrument requirements a mission concept has been\ndeveloped featuring an X-ray telescope of 50-m focal length, comprising two\nlaser-locked (separate) mirror and detector spacecraft's. The telescope is\ninjected in a low earth orbit with an inclination commensurate with the ISS. At\npresent an on-orbit growth of the mirror spacecraft is foreseen with the aid of\nthe ISS, raising the mirror diameter from 4.5 to 10 m. The detector spacecraft\nwill be replaced at 5 year intervals after run-out of consumables with an\nassociated upgrade of the focal plane package.",

The contribution due to faculae and the network is of basic\nimportance, but suffers from considerable uncertainty. We determine the\ncontrasts of active region faculae and the network, both as a function of\nheliocentric angle and magnetogram signal. To achieve this, we analyze\nnear-simultaneous full disk images of photospheric continuum intensity and\nline-of-sight magnetic field provided by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer\n(MDI) on board the SOHO spacecraft. Starting from the surface distribution of\nthe solar magnetic field we first construct a mask, which is then used to\ndetermine the brightness of magnetic features, and the relatively field-free\npart of the photosphere separately. By sorting the magnetogram signal into\ndifferent bins we are able to distinguish between the contrasts of different\nconcentrations of magnetic field. We find that the contrasts of active region\nfaculae (large magnetogram signal) and the network (small signal) exhibit a\nvery different CLV, showing that the populations of magnetic flux tubes are\ndifferent. This implies that these elements need to be treated separately when\nreconstructing variations of the total solar irradiance with high precision. We\nhave obtained an analytical expression for the contrast of photospheric\nmagnetic features as a function of both position on the disk and magnetic field\nstrength, by performing a 2-dimensional fit to the observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Jovian dust streams are high-speed bursts of submicron-sized particles\ntraveling in the same direction from a source in the Jovian system. Since their\ndiscovery in 1992, they have been observed by three spacecraft: Ulysses,\nGalileo and Cassini. The source of the Jovian dust streams is dust from Io's\nvolcanoes. The charged and traveling dust stream particles have particular\nsignatures in frequency space and in real space. The frequency-transformed\nGalileo dust stream measurements show different signatures, varying\norbit-to-orbit during Galileo's first 29 orbits around Jupiter. Time-frequency\nanalysis demonstrates that Io is a localized source of charged dust particles.\nAspects of the particles' dynamics can be seen in the December-2000 joint\nGalileo-Cassini dust stream measurements. To match the travel times, the\nsmallest dust particles could have the following range of parameters: radius:\n6nm, density: 1.35-1.75gr/cm$^3$, sulfur charging conditions, which produce\ndust stream speeds: 220|450km/sec (Galileo|Cassini) and charge potentials:\n5.5|6.3Volt (Galileo|Cassini).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have studied the science rationale, goals and requirements for a mission\naimed at using the gravitational lensing from the Sun as a way of achieving\nhigh angular resolution and high signal amplification. We find that such a\nmission concept is plagued by several practical problems. Most severe are the\neffects due to the plasma in the solar atmosphere which cause refraction and\nscattering of the propagating rays. These effects limit the frequencies that\ncan be observed to those above $\\sim$100-200 GHz and moves the optical point\noutwards beyond the vacuum value of $\\geq$ 550 AU. Density fluctuations in the\ninner solar atmosphere will further cause random pathlength differences for\ndifferent rays. The corrections for the radiation from the Sun itself will also\nbe a major challenge at any wavelength used. Given reasonable constraints on\nthe spacecraft (particularly in terms of size and propulsion) source selection\nas well as severe navigational constraints further add to the difficulties for\na potential mission.",
