    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have built and evaluated a prototype quantum radar, which we call a\nquantum two-mode squeezing radar (QTMS radar), in the laboratory. It operates\nsolely at microwave frequencies; there is no downconversion from optical\nfrequencies. Because the signal generation process relies on quantum mechanical\nprinciples, the system is considered to contain a quantum-enhanced radar\ntransmitter. This transmitter generates a pair of entangled microwave signals\nand transmits one of them through free space, where the signal is measured\nusing a simple and rudimentary receiver.\nAt the heart of the transmitter is a device called a Josephson parametric\namplifier (JPA), which generates a pair of entangled signals called two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum (TMSV) at 6.1445 GHz and 7.5376 GHz. These are then sent\nthrough a chain of amplifiers. The 7.5376 GHz beam passes through 0.5 m of free\nspace; the 6.1445 GHz signal is measured directly after amplification. The two\nmeasurement results are correlated in order to distinguish signal from noise.\nWe compare our QTMS radar to a classical radar setup using conventional\ncomponents, which we call a two-mode noise radar (TMN radar), and find that\nthere is a significant gain when both systems broadcast signals at -82 dBm.\nThis is shown via a comparison of receiver operator characteristic (ROC)\ncurves. In particular, we find that the quantum radar requires 8 times fewer\nintegrated samples compared to its classical counterpart to achieve the same\nperformance.",

The\nflow equations are discretised with a mixed discontinuous Galerkin formulation\nand are advanced in time with an explicit time marching scheme. The\ndiscretisation meshes may contain simplicial (triangular or tetrahedral)\nelements of different sizes and need not be structured. On the discretisation\nmesh the fluid domain boundary is represented with an implicit signed distance\nfunction. The cut-elements partially covered by the solid domain are integrated\nafter tessellation with the marching triangle or tetrahedra algorithms. Two\nalternative techniques are introduced to overcome the excessive stable time\nstep restrictions imposed by cut-elements. In the first approach the cut-basis\nfunctions are replaced with the extrapolated basis functions from the nearest\nlargest element. In the second approach the cut-basis functions are simply\nscaled proportionally to the fraction of the cut-element covered by the solid.\nTo achieve high-order accuracy additional nodes are introduced on the element\nfaces abutting the solid boundary. Subsequently, the faces are curved by\nprojecting the introduced nodes to the boundary. The proposed approach is\nverified and validated with several two- and three-dimensional subsonic and\nhypersonic low Reynolds number flow applications, including the flow over a\ncylinder, a space capsule and an aerospace vehicle.",

GaN is also stable in\nradiation-rich and high-temperature environments, which makes photodetectors\nfabricated using this material useful for in-situ flame detection and\ncombustion monitoring. In this paper, we use a GaN photodetector to measure\nultraviolet (UV) emissions from a hybrid rocket motor igniter plume. The\nnormalized photocurrent-to-dark current ratio (NPDR) is a performance metric\nwhich simultaneously captures the two desired characteristics of high\nresponsivity and low dark current. The NPDR of our device is record-high with a\nvalue of 6 x 10$^{14}$ W$^{-1}$ and the UV-to-visible rejection ratio is 4 x\n10$^6$. The photodetector shows operation at high temperatures (up to\n250\u00b0C), with the NPDR still remaining above 10$^9$ W$^{-1}$ and the peak\nwavelength shifting from 362 nm to 375 nm. The photodetector was placed at\nthree radial distances (3\", 5.5\", and 7\") from the base of the igniter plume\nand the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (O2/CH4) was varied. The data demonstrates a\nclear trend of increasing current (and thus intensity of plume emission) with\nincreasing fuel concentration and decreasing separation between the\nphotodetector and the plume. By treating the plume as a black body, and\ncalculating a radiative configuration factor corresponding to the geometry of\nthe plume and the detector, we calculated average plume temperatures at each of\nthe three oxidizer-to-fuel ratios. The estimated plume temperatures were\nbetween 850 and 950 K for all three combustion conditions. The temperature is\nroughly invariant for a fixed fuel concentration for the three tested\ndistances. These data demonstrate the functionality of GaN as a material\nplatform for use in harsh environment flame monitoring.",

As many\napplications of collision detection run online, timing requirements are imposed\non the algorithm runtime: algorithms must, at a minimum, keep up with the\npassage of time. In practice, this places a limit on the number of objects, n,\nthat can be tracked at the same time. In this paper, we improve the scalability\nof collision detection, effectively raising the limit n for online object\ntracking.\nThe key to our approach is the use of a four-dimensional axis-aligned\nbounding box (AABB) tree, which stores each object's three-dimensional\noccupancy region in space during a one-dimensional interval of time. This\nimproves efficiency by permitting per-object variable times steps. Further, we\ndescribe partitioning strategies that can decompose the 4D AABB tree search\ninto several smaller-dimensional problems that can be solved in parallel.

In the detection phase, raw\nsignals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain. A Markov\nmodels-based naive Bayes approach is used to check for the presence of a UAV in\neach frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that\nrely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed\ntechnique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to\nnoise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized\nenergy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of\nthe raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient\nare detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy\ntrajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy\ntransient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood\ncomponent analysis (NCA) to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low.\nFinally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for\nclassification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database\ncontaining 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The\nsignals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data\nset is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the\nratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to\nassess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected\ncorrectly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest\nneighbor (kNN) classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and results are reported.",

This is\nachieved through the use of highly stretched elements in the viscous boundary\nlayers near the wall surfaces. CADfix is used to first repair any possible\ndefects in the CAD geometry and then generate a medial object based\ndecomposition of the domain that wraps the wall boundaries with partitions\nsuitable for the generation of either prismatic or hexahedral elements. The\nlatter is a novel distinctive feature of the method that permits to obtain\nwell-shaped hexahedral meshes at corners or junctions in the boundary layer.\nThe medial object approach allows greater control on the \"thickness\" of the\nboundary-layer mesh than is generally achievable with advancing layer\ntechniques. CADfix subsequently generates a hybrid straight sided mesh of\nprismatic and hexahedral elements in the near-field region modelling the\nboundary layer, and tetrahedral elements in the far-field region covering the\nrest of the domain. The mesh in the near-field region provides a framework that\nfacilitates the generation, via an isoparametric technique, of layers of highly\nstretched elements with a distribution of points in the direction normal to the\nwall tailored to efficiently and accurately capture the flow in the boundary\nlayer. The final step is the generation of a high-order mesh using NekMesh, a\nhigh-order mesh generator within the Nektar++ framework. NekMesh uses the\nCADfix API as a geometry engine that handles all the geometrical queries to the\nCAD geometry required during the high-order mesh generation process. We will\ndescribe in some detail the methodology using a simple geometry, a NACA wing\ntip, for illustrative purposes. Finally, we will present two examples of\napplication to reasonably complex geometries proposed by NASA as CFD validation\ncases.",

The measurements from these previous experiments demonstrated\nthickening and mixing enhancement of the jet shear layer as a result of fluidic\ninjection. The current numerical study examines the underlying physics of the\nflow field, as well as the effectiveness of the DMFI system at smaller mass\nflow rate ratios compared to those utilized in the previous experiments.\nResults indicate good agreement with the trend observed by the experimental\nstudy, and considerable improvement in enhancement of the jet mixing is\nobserved. The observed mixing enhancement is attributed to the presence of the\nmicrojet tube and fluidic injection and the consequent generation of streamwise\nvortices, as well as the natural separating bow shock due to the transverse\nflow injection. DMFI system is shown to enhance the early mixing, resulting in\nattenuation of the downstream turbulence production. Furthermore, the DMFI\nsystem is demonstrated to be an effective method of mixing enhancement for\nsupersonic jets with a potential for reducing the jet noise radiation.",

But we lack direct knowledge of\nthe geophysical behavior of an asteroid surface under milligravity conditions,\nand therefore landing on an asteroid and manipulating its surface material\nremains a daunting challenge.\nTowards this goal we are putting forth plans for a 12U CubeSat that will be\nin Low Earth Orbit and that will operate as a spinning centrifuge on-orbit. In\nthis paper, we will present an overview of the systems engineering and\ninstrumentation design on the spacecraft.

The laboratory will spin at 1 to 2 RPM during the\nprimary mission to simulate surface conditions of asteroids 2 km and smaller,\nfollowed by an extended mission where the spacecraft will spin at even higher\nRPM. The result is a bed of realistic regolith, the environment that landers\nand diggers and maybe astronauts will interact with. The CubeSat is configured\nwith cameras, lasers, actuators and small mechanical instruments to both\nobserve and manipulate the regolith at low simulated gravity conditions.

The risk is so high that missions such as\nHayabusa II and OSIRIS-REx will be performing touch and go missions to obtain\nsamples. The next logical step is to perform longer-term mobility on the\nsurface of these asteroid. This can be accomplished by sending small landers of\na 1 kg or less with miniature propulsion systems that can just offset the force\nof asteroid gravity. Such a propulsion system would ideally be used to hop on\nthe surface of the asteroid. Hopping has been found to be most efficient form\nof mobility on low-gravity. Use of wheels for rolling presents substantial\nchallenges as the wheel can't gain traction to roll. The Asteroid Mobile Imager\nand Geologic Observer (AMIGO) utilizes 1 kg landers that are stowed in a 1U\nCubeSat configuration and deployed, releasing an inflatable that is 1 m in\ndiameter. The inflatable is attached to the top of the 1U lander, enabling high\nspeed communications and a means of easily tracking lander from an overhead\nmothership. Milligravity propulsion is required for the AMIGO landers to\nperform ballistic hops on the asteroid surface. The propulsion system is used\nto navigate the lander across the surface of the asteroid under the extremely\nlow gravity while taking care to not exceed escape velocity.Although the\nconcept for AMIGO missions is to use multiple landers, the more surface area\nevaluated by each lander the better. Without a propulsion system, each AMIGO\nwill have a limited range of observable area.

We empirically evaluate our\napproach by using only a human demonstration model and modified DQN with human\ndemonstration model included in the Microsoft AirSim car simulator. Our results\nshow that (1) pre-training with human demonstration in a supervised learning\napproach is better and much faster at discovering features than DQN alone, (2)\ninitializing the DQN with a pre-trained model provides a significant\nimprovement in training time and performance even with limited human\ndemonstration, and (3) providing the ability for humans to supply suggestions\nduring DQN training can speed up the network's convergence on an optimal\npolicy, as well as allow it to learn more complex policies that are harder to\ndiscover by random exploration.",

Measurements were performed using UWB\nradios operating at a frequency range of 3.1 GHz - 4.8 GHz and UWB planar\nelliptical dipole antennas having an omni-directional pattern in the azimuth\nplane and typical donut shaped pattern in the elevation plane. Three scenarios\nwere considered for the channel measurements: (i)two receivers (RXs) at\ndifferent heights above the ground and placed close to each other in\nline-of-sight (LOS) with the transmitter (TX) on the UAV and the UAV is\nhovering; (ii) RXs are in obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) with the UAV TX due\nto foliage, and the UAV is hovering; and, (iii) UAV is moving in a circular\npath. Different horizontal and vertical distances between the RXs and TX were\nused in the measurements. In addition, two different antenna orientations were\nused on the UAV antennas (vertical and horizontal) to analyze the effects of\nantenna radiation patterns on the UWB AG propagation. From the empirical\nresults, it was observed that the received power depends mainly on the antenna\nradiation pattern in the elevation plane when the antennas are oriented in the\nsame direction, as expected for these omni-azimuth antennas. Moreover, the\noverall antenna gain at the TX and RX can be approximated using trigonometric\nfunctions of the elevation angle.",

Specifically, we extend\nthe method for static systems with parametric geometry (that deforms the mesh),\nin addition to parametric boundary conditions. The main idea is to first\nperform a transformation on the governing equations such that it is lifted to a\nhigher dimensional but linear under-determined system. This enables one to\nextract the system matrices easily compared to that of the original non-linear\nsystem. The under-determined system is closed with a set of model-dependent\nnon-linear constraints upon which the model reduction is finally performed. The\nmethodology is validated on the subsonic and transonic inviscid flow past the\nNACA0012 and the RAE2822 airfoils. We further demonstrate the utility of the\napproach by applying it to two common problems in aerospace design namely,\nderivative-free global optimization and parametric uncertainty quantification\nwith Monte Carlo sampling.

To overpass the traditional capabilities of those coatings,\nnew functionalities and coherent responses are being integrated, opening the\nfield of functional and smart coatings. The aim of this paper is to present a\ncomprehensive review of the current state of functional and smart coatings\nproduced using thermal spraying deposition. It will first describe the\ndifferent thermal spraying technologies, with a focus on how different\ntechniques achieve the thermal and kinetic energy required to form a coating,\nas well as the environment to which feedstock particles are exposed in terms of\ntemperature and velocity. It will then deal with the state-of-the-art\nfunctional and smart coatings applied using thermal spraying techniques, with a\ndiscussion on the fundamentals on which the coatings are designed, the\nefficiency of its performance and the industrial applications, both current and\npotential. The inherent designing flexibility of thermal sprayed functional and\nsmart coatings has been exploited to explore exciting new possibilities on many\ndifferent fields. Applications such as anti-bacterial and anti-fouling\ncoatings, superhydrophobic surfaces, electrical and heating devices for\nfunctional coatings and self-healing, self-lubricating and sensors for smart\ncoatings are here presented and discussed. All these exciting developments pave\nthe way for the numerous applications that are to come in the next decade,\nmaking the field of thermal sprayed coatings a unique opportunity for research.",

However, two issues hinder reliable on-board monocular vision\nbased pose estimation: robustness to illumination conditions due to a lack of\nreliable visual features and scarcity of image datasets required for training\nand benchmarking. To address these two issues, this work details the design and\nvalidation of a monocular vision based pose determination architecture for\nspaceborne applications. The primary contribution to the state-of-the-art of\nthis work is the introduction of a novel pose determination method based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to provide an initial guess of the pose in\nreal-time on-board. The method involves discretizing the pose space and\ntraining the CNN with images corresponding to the resulting pose labels. Since\nreliable training of the CNN requires massive image datasets and computational\nresources, the parameters of the CNN must be determined prior to the mission\nwith synthetic imagery. Moreover, reliable training of the CNN requires\ndatasets that appropriately account for noise, color, and illumination\ncharacteristics expected in orbit. Therefore, the secondary contribution of\nthis work is the introduction of an image synthesis pipeline, which is tailored\nto generate high fidelity images of any spacecraft 3D model. The proposed\ntechnique is scalable to spacecraft of different structural and physical\nproperties as well as robust to the dynamic illumination conditions of space.\nThrough metrics measuring classification and pose accuracy, it is shown that\nthe presented architecture has desirable robustness and scalable properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Drone racing is becoming a popular sport where human pilots have to control\ntheir drones to fly at high speed through complex environments and pass a\nnumber of gates in a pre-defined sequence. In this paper, we develop an\nautonomous system for drones to race fully autonomously using only onboard\nresources. Instead of commonly used visual navigation methods, such as\nsimultaneous localization and mapping and visual inertial odometry, which are\ncomputationally expensive for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we developed the\nhighly efficient snake gate detection algorithm for visual navigation, which\ncan detect the gate at 20HZ on a Parrot Bebop drone. Then, with the gate\ndetection result, we developed a robust pose estimation algorithm which has\nbetter tolerance to detection noise than a state-of-the-art perspective-n-point\nmethod. During the race, sometimes the gates are not in the drone's field of\nview. For this case, a state prediction-based feed-forward control strategy is\ndeveloped to steer the drone to fly to the next gate. Experiments show that the\ndrone can fly a half-circle with 1.5m radius within 2 seconds with only 30cm\nerror at the end of the circle without any position feedback. Finally, the\nwhole system is tested in a complex environment (a showroom in the faculty of\nAerospace Engineering, TU Delft). The result shows that the drone can complete\nthe track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5m/s which is faster than the speeds\nexhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.",

Key elements of the\nresponse are the amplitude, phase, and damping ratio, which are quantities that\nvary with the excitation frequency. In this paper, we extend the discipline of\nstructural dynamics to the realm of materials engineering by intrinsically\nbuilding localized substructures within, or attached to, the material domain\nitself$-$which is viewed as an extended medium without defined external\nboundaries. Our system is essentially a locally resonant elastic metamaterial,\nexcept here it is viewed from the perspective of unique dissipation\ncharacteristics rather than subwavelength effective properties or band gaps, as\nwidely done in the literature. We provide a theory, validated by experiments,\nfor substructurally synthesizing the dissipation under the conditions of\nfree-wave motion, i.e., waves not constrained to a prescribed driving\nfrequency. We use an extended elastic beam with attached pillars as an example\nof a metamaterial. When compared to an identical infinite beam with no attached\nsubstructures, we show that within certain frequency ranges the metamaterial\nexhibits either enhanced or reduced dissipation$-$which we refer to as positive\nand negative metadamping, respectively. These regimes are rigorously identified\nand characterized using the metamaterial's band structure and\nwavenumber-dependent dissipation diagram. This theory impacts applications that\nrequire a combination of high stiffness and high damping or, conversely,\napplications that benefit from a reduction in loss without the need to change\nthe backbone constituent material.",

The classical approach to\nthis problem is to augment the state vector to include the states of all the\ntargets and the sensor biases, and then implement an augmented state Kalman\nfilter (ASKF). In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled Kalman filtering\nalgorithm. The decoupled Kalman filtering first processes each target in a\nseparate branch, namely the single-target Kalman filtering branch, where the\nsingle-target states and the sensor biases are estimated. Then the bias\nestimate is refined by fusing the former bias estimates across all the\nsingle-target Kalman filtering branches. Finally, the refined bias estimate is\nfed back to each single-target Kalman filtering branch to improve the target\nstate estimation. We prove that the proposed decoupled Kalman filtering is\nexactly equivalent to the ASKF in terms of the estimation results under a usual\ninitial condition. The equivalence is also confirmed via the numerical example.\nMoreover, we further validate the proposed algorithm using the field\nexperimental data of a multistatic passive radar.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  \"Auxetic\" materials have the counter-intuitive property of expanding rather\nthan contracting perpendicular to an applied stretch, formally they have\nnegative Poisson's Ratios (PRs).[1,2] This results in properties such as\nenhanced energy absorption and indentation resistance, which means that\nauxetics have potential for applications in areas from aerospace to biomedical\nindustries.[3,4] Existing synthetic auxetics are all created by carefully\nstructuring porous geometries from positive PR materials. Crucially, their\ngeometry causes the auxeticity.[3,4] The necessary porosity weakens the\nmaterial compared to the bulk and the structure must be engineered, for\nexample, by using resource-intensive additive manufacturing processes.[1,5] A\nlongstanding goal for researchers has been the development of a synthetic\nmaterial that has intrinsic auxetic behaviour. Such \"molecular auxetics\" would\navoid porosity-weakening and their very existence implies chemical\ntuneability.[1,4-9] However molecular auxeticity has never previously been\nproven for a synthetic material.[6,7] Here we present a synthetic molecular\nauxetic based on a monodomain liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). When stressed\nperpendicular to the alignment direction, the LCE becomes auxetic at strains\ngreater than approximately 0.8 with a minimum PR of -0.8. The critical strain\nfor auxeticity coincides with the occurrence of a negative liquid crystal order\nparameter (LCOP). We show the auxeticity agrees with theoretical predictions\nderived from the Warner and Terentjev theory of LCEs.[10] This demonstration of\na synthetic molecular auxetic represents the origin of a new approach to\nproducing molecular auxetics with a range of physical properties and functional\nbehaviours. Further, it demonstrates a novel feature of LCEs and a route for\nrealisation of the molecular auxetic technologies that have been proposed over\nthe years.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Wireless links are characterized by fluctuating quality leading to variable\npacket error rates which are orders of magnitude higher than the ones of wired\nlinks. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to investigate the limitations\nof using 5G wireless links for internet of things (IoT) applications. 5G\nwireless links in IoT need to assure determinism of process flows via realtime\ncommunication anytime and anywhere, which is an utmost requirement for multiple\nverticals like automotive, industrial automation and aerospace. Based on a\nspace-time approach, in this work, we provide novel definitions of wireless\nlink availability and reliability, assuming a number of access points (APs) and\nend points (EPs) deployed over a fixed area. Our objective is to analyze the\navailability of a service in both domains. In the space domain, we characterize\nspatially available areas consisting of all locations that meet a performance\nrequirement with confidence. In the time domain, we propose a channel\nallocation scheme accounting for the spatial availability of a cell. To\nemphasize the incurred space-time performance trade-offs, numerical results are\npresented, also highlighting the effect of different system parameters on the\nachievable link availability and reliability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In computational fluid dynamics simulations of industrial flows, models based\non the Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations are expected to play\nan important role in decades to come. However, model uncertainties are still a\nmajor obstacle for the predictive capability of RANS simulations. This review\nexamines both the parametric and structural uncertainties in turbulence models.\nWe review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and\ndata-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing\nmodel uncertainties in RANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of\nuncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of\nRANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties\nin scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on\nlarge eddy simulations.",
