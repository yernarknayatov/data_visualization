    "abstract": "Abstract:  Sublimating gas molecules scatter off of the surface of an icy body in the\nsame manner as photons. This means that for every photon-driven body force,\nthere should be a sublimation-driven analogue that affects icy bodies. Thermal\nphotons emitted from the surfaces of asymmetrically shaped bodies in the Solar\nSystem generate net torques that change the spin rates of these bodies over\ntime. The long-term averaging of this torque is called the YORP effect. Here we\npropose a sublimation-driven analogue to the YORP effect (SYORP), in which\nsublimating gas molecules emitted from the surfaces of icy bodies also generate\nnet torques on the bodies. However, sublimating molecules carry momentum away\nfrom the body at a rate ~10^4-10^5 greater than thermal photons, resulting in\nmuch greater body torques. While previous studies of sublimative torques\nfocused on emissions from highly localized sources on the surfaces of Jupiter\nFamily Comet nuclei, SYORP applies to non-localized emissions across the entire\nbody, which likely dominates sublimation-drive torques on small icy chunks and\nDynamically Young Comets, and can therefore be applied without high-resolution\nspacecraft observations of their surfaces. Instead, we repurpose the equations\nof the YORP effect to account for sublimation-driven torques. We show how an\nSYORP-driven mechanism best matches observations of the Sun-oriented lineaments\n(striae) of comet tails, whose formation mechanism has remained enigmatic for\ndecades. The SYORP effect explains why striae are observed between\nnear-perihelion and ~1 AU from the Sun for comets with perihelia less than 0.6\nAU, and solves longstanding problems with moving enough material into the\ncometary tail to form visible striae. We show that SYORP can form striae that\nmatch those of Comet West, and produce a power-law size frequency distribution\nof their parent chunks with an index of -1.4 (-1.1- 2).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Images obtained by the Cassini spacecraft between 2012 and 2015 reveal a\nperiodic brightness variation in a region of Saturn's D ring that previously\nappeared to be rather featureless. Furthermore, the intensity and radial\nwavenumber of this pattern have decreased steadily with time since it was first\nobserved. Based on analogies with similar structures elsewhere in the D ring,\nwe propose that this structure was created by some event that disturbed the\norbital motions of the ring particles, giving them finite orbital\neccentricities and initially aligned pericenters. Differential orbital\nprecession then transformed this structure into a spiral pattern in the ring's\noptical depth that became increasingly tightly wound over time. The observed\ntrends in the pattern's radial wavenumber are roughly consistent with this\nbasic model, and also indicate that the ring-disturbing event occurred in early\nDecember 2011. Similar events in 1979 may have generated the periodic patterns\nseen in this same region by the Voyager spacecraft. The 2011 event could have\nbeen caused by debris striking the rings, or by a disturbance in the planet's\nelectromagnetic environment. The rapid reduction in the intensity of the\nbrightness variations over the course of just a few years indicates that some\nprocess is either damping orbital eccentricities in this region or causing the\norbital pericenters of particles with the same semi-major axis to become\nmisaligned.",

However, the resolution of\nthe RADAR instrument is not good enough to allow a detailed study of the\nmorphology of these features. In addition, other linear wind-related landforms,\nsuch as mega-yardangs (linear wind-abraded ridges formed in cohesive rocks),\nare likely to present a comparable radar signature that could be confused with\nthe one of dunes.

We analysed\nthe radar scattering of both terrestrial linear dunes and mega-yardangs, using\nhigh-resolution radar images acquired by the X-band (9.6 GHz - 3.1 cm) sensor\nof the TerraSAR-X satellite. Variations seen in the radar response of dunes are\nthe result of a contrast between the dune and interdune scattering, while for\nmega-yardangs these variations are the result of a contrast between ridges and\nerosion valleys. We tested a simple surface scattering model, with parameters\nderived from the local topography and surface roughness estimates, to\naccurately reproduce the radar signal variations for both landforms.

For the first time, we can\nreport the simultaneous observation of counter-propagating magnetohydrodynamic\nwaves in the solar wind turbulence. Different from the traditional paradigm\nwith counter-propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves, anti-sunward Alfv\u00e9n waves (AWs) are\nencountered by sunward slow magnetosonic waves (SMWs) in this new type of solar\nwind compressible turbulence. The counter-propagating AWs and SWs correspond\nrespectively to the dominant and sub-dominant populations of the imbalanced\nEls\u00e4sser variables. Nonlinear interactions between the AWs and SMWs are\ninferred from the non-orthogonality between the possible oscillation direction\nof one wave and the possible propagation direction of the other. The associated\nprotons are revealed to exhibit bi-directional asymmetric beams in their\nvelocity distributions: sunward beams appearing in short and narrow patterns\nand anti-sunward broad extended tails. It is suggested that multiple types of\nwave-particle interactions, i.e., cyclotron and Landau resonances with AWs and\nSMWs at kinetic scales, are taking place to jointly heat the protons\nperpendicularly and parallel.",

Itokawa was the target of the Hayabusa sample\nreturn mission and has a surface composition similar to LL-type ordinary\nchondrites. Existing laboratory spectral calibrations use a spectral wavelength\nrange that is wider (0.75-2.5 microns) than that of the NIRS instrument\n(0.85-2.1 microns) making them unfit for interpreting the Hayabusa spectral\ndata currently archived in the Planetary Data System. We used laboratory\nmeasured near-infrared reflectance spectra of ordinary (H, L and LL) chondrites\nfrom the study of Dunn et al. (2010), which we resampled to the NIRS wavelength\nrange. Using spectral parameters extracted from these resampled spectra we\nestablished a relationship between band parameters and their mafic silicate\ncomposition (olivine and low-Ca pyroxene). We found a correlation >90% between\nmafic silicate composition (fayalite and forsterite mol. %) estimated by our\nspectral method and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measured values. To test the\nvalidity of the newly derived equations we blind tested them using nine\nlaboratory-measured spectra of L and LL type chondrites with known composition.\nWe found that the absolute difference between the measured and computed values\nis in the range 0.1 to 1.6 mol. %. Our study suggests that the derived\ncalibration is robust and can be applied to Hayabusa NIRS data despite its\nlimited spectral range.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) experiment on board the two STEREO spacecraft\n(Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory) launched on 25 October 2006 is\ndedicated to the measurement of the radio spectrum at frequencies between a few\nkilohertz and 16 MHz. The SWAVES antenna system consists of 6 m long orthogonal\nmonopoles designed to measure the electric component of the radio waves. With\nthis configuration direction finding of radio sources and polarimetry (analysis\nof the polarization state) of incident radio waves is possible. For the\nevaluation of the SWAVES data the receiving properties of the antennas,\ndistorted by the radiation coupling with the spacecraft body and other onboard\ndevices, have to be known accurately. In the present context, these properties\nare described by the antenna effective length vectors. We present the results\nof an in-flight calibration of the SWAVES antennas using the observations of\nthe nonthermal terrestrial auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) during STEREO\nroll maneuvers in an early stage of the mission. A least squares method\ncombined with a genetic algorithm was applied to find the effective length\nvectors of the STEREO Behind (STEREO-B)/WAVES antennas in a quasi-static\nfrequency range ($L_{antenna} \\ll \\lambda_{wave}$) which fit best to the model\nand observed AKR intensity profiles. The obtained results confirm the former\nSWAVES antenna analysis by rheometry and numerical simulations. A final set of\nantenna parameters is recommended as a basis for evaluations of the SWAVES\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The field of asteroid thermophysical modeling has experienced an\nextraordinary growth in the last ten years, as new thermal infrared data became\navailable for hundreds of thousands of asteroids. The infrared emission of\nasteroids depends on the body's size, shape, albedo, thermal inertia, roughness\nand rotational properties. These parameters can therefore be derived by\nthermophysical modeling of infrared data. Thermophysical modeling led to\nasteroid size estimates that were confirmed at the few-percent level by later\nspacecraft visits. We discuss how instrumentation advances now allow\nmid-infrared interferometric observations as well as high-accuracy\nspectro-photometry, posing their own set of thermal-modeling challenges.We\npresent major breakthroughs achieved in studies of the thermal inertia, a\nsensitive indicator for the nature of asteroids soils, allowing us, for\ninstance, to determine the grain size of asteroidal regoliths. Thermal inertia\nalso governs non-gravitational effects on asteroid orbits, requiring\nthermophysical modeling for precise asteroid dynamical studies. The radiative\nheating of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets from the Sun also governs the\nthermal stress in surface material; only recently has it been recognized as a\nsignificant weathering process. Asteroid space missions with thermal infrared\ninstruments are currently undergoing study at all major space agencies. This\nwill require a high level of sophistication of thermophysical models in order\nto analyze high-quality spacecraft data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The outer solar atmosphere, i.e., the corona and the chromosphere, is replete\nwith small energy-release events, which are accompanied by transient\nbrightening and jet-like ejections. These events are considered to be magnetic\nreconnection events in the solar plasma, and their dynamics have been studied\nusing recent advanced observations from the Hinode spacecraft and other\nobservatories in space and on the ground. These events occur at different\nlocations in the solar atmosphere, and vary in their morphology and amount of\nthe released energy. The magnetic field configurations of these reconnection\nevents are inferred based on observations of magnetic fields at the\nphotospheric level. Observations suggest that these magnetic configurations can\nbe classified into two groups. In the first group, two anti-parallel magnetic\nfields reconnect to each other, yielding a 2D emerging flux configuration. In\nthe second group, helical or twisted magnetic flux tubes are parallel or at a\nrelative angle to each other. Reconnection can occur only between anti-parallel\ncomponents of the magnetic flux tubes and may be referred to as component\nreconnection. The latter configuration type may be more important for the\nlarger class of small-scale reconnection events. The two types of magnetic\nconfigurations can be compared to counter-helicity and co-helicity\nconfigurations, respectively, in laboratory plasma collision experiments.",

We analysed several parameters of the ISD flow in a\ntime-resolved fashion: flux, flow direction, mass index, and flow width. The\ngeneral picture is in agreement with a time-dependent focussing/defocussing of\nthe charged dust particles due to long-term variations of the solar magnetic\nfield throughout a solar magnetic cycle of 22 years. In addition, we confirm a\nshift in dust direction of $50^{\\circ} \\pm 7^{\\circ}$ in 2005, along with a\nsteep, size-dependent increase in flux by a factor of 4 within 8 months. To\ndate, this is difficult to interpret and has to be examined in more detail by\nnew dynamical simulations. This work is part of a series of three papers. This\npaper concentrates on the time-dependent flux and direction of the ISD. In a\ncompanion paper (Kr\u00fcger et al., 2015) we analyse the overall mass\ndistribution of the ISD measured by Ulysses, and a third paper discusses the\nresults of modelling the flow of the ISD as seen by Ulysses (Sterken et al.,\n2015).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The primary challenge of rocket propulsion is the burden of needing to\naccelerate the spacecraft's own fuel, resulting in only a logarithmic gain in\nmaximum speed as propellant is added to the spacecraft. Light sails offer an\nattractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with\nacceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially\nilluminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by\nthe area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the\naccelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail\npropulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be\ndetectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave\nbeam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around\na single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.\nLeakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and\ndurations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary\nsystem would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system,\nmultiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of\ndetection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed\nfrom Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly\nemployed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of\nnearby transiting exoplanetary systems. The expected signal properties define a\nnew strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).",

Three\ndifferent analysis methods are used to separately determine spectral\ncoefficients representing the poloidal flows, the toroidal flows, and the\nradial flows. The amplitudes of these spectral coefficients are constrained by\nsimulated data analyzed with the same procedures as the HMI data. We find that\nthe total velocity spectrum rises smoothly to a peak at a wavenumber of about\n120 (wavelength of about 35 Mm), which is typical of supergranules. The\nspectrum levels off out to wavenumbers of about 400, and then rises again to a\npeak at a wavenumber of about 3500 (wavelength of about 1200 km), which is\ntypical of granules. The velocity spectrum is dominated by the poloidal flow\ncomponent (horizontal flows with divergence but no curl) at wavenumbers above\n30. The toroidal flow component (horizontal flows with curl but no divergence)\ndominates at wavenumbers less than 30. The radial flow velocity is only about\n3\\% of the total flow velocity at the lowest wavenumbers, but increases in\nstrength to become about 50\\% at wavenumbers near 4000.

Here we present the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) for\nKepler data, a data-driven model intended to capture variability but preserve\ntransit signals. The CPM works at the pixel level so that it can capture very\nfine-grained information about the variation of the spacecraft. The CPM\npredicts each target pixel value from a large number of pixels of other stars\nsharing the instrument variabilities while not containing any information on\npossible transits in the target star. In addition, we use the target star's\nfuture and past (auto-regression). By appropriately separating, for each data\npoint, the data into training and test sets, we ensure that information about\nany transit will be perfectly isolated from the model. The method has four\nhyper-parameters (the number of predictor stars, the auto-regressive window\nsize, and two L2-regularization amplitudes for model components), which we set\nby cross-validation. We determine a generic set of hyper-parameters that works\nwell for most of the stars and apply the method to a corresponding set of\ntarget stars. We find that we can consistently outperform (for the purposes of\nexoplanet detection) the Kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) method for\nexoplanet discovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Utilizing new Voyager measurements at lower energies and higher energy\nspacecraft measurements near the Earth, the interstellar spectra of primary\ncosmic ray nuclei from H to Fe have now been determined from ~10 MeV/nuc to >\n100 GeV/nuc. These measurements are compared with the predictions from a Leaky\nBox propagation model. It is found that above ~50-100 MeV/nuc the spectra of\nall the nuclei, H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are well connected between 100\nMeV/nuc and 10 GeV/nuc and above by simple source rigidity spectra proportional\nto P-2.28, with the exponent independent of rigidity and using a rigidity\ndependent diffusion coefficient ~P0.50 above ~1.0 GV. This leads to intensities\nand spectra ~P-2.78 at ~100 GeV/nuc and above, which are consistent with new\nAMS-2 and PAMELA measurements of H, He and C to within + 10%.\nBelow 50-100 MeV the spectra of these primary charges fall into two groups.\nThe spectra of primary nuclei with Z > 6 fall more rapidly at low energies than\nthose of H and He and more rapidly than would be expected from a pure diffusive\nLBM, where energy loss by ionization is important at low energies. Increasing\nthe fraction of ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium from 15% to 30%\ndoes not satisfactorily explain the systematics of the intensity decreases of\nthe heavier primary nuclei at low energies. Other processes beyond those\nassumed in a simple leaky box model, such as a lack of cosmic ray sources near\nthe Sun are being investigated as the source of this more rapid intensity\ndecrease of these nuclei.\nThe spectra of H and He are very similar to each other but both contain more\nlow energy particles than would be expected from a correspondence with the\nheavier nuclei spectra. We believe that this may indicate the presence of a\nlocal (heliospheric) component of these nuclei in addition to the galactic\ncomponent.",

TCOs\nform a new population of near Earth objects presenting many advantages toward\nthat goal. Prior to the mission, we consider the spacecraft hibernating on a\nHalo orbit around the Earth-Moon's $L_2$ libration point. The objective is to\ndesign a transfer for the spacecraft from the parking orbit to rendezvous with\n\\RH while minimizing the fuel consumption. Our transfers use indirect methods,\nbased on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, combined with continuation\ntechniques and a direct method to address the sensitivity of the\ninitialization. We demonstrate that a rendezvous mission with \\RH can be\naccomplished with low delta-v. This exploratory work can be seen as a first\nstep to identify good candidates for a rendezvous on a given TCO trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The appearance of debris disks around distant stars depends upon the\nscattering/phase function (SPF) of the material in the disk. However,\ncharacterizing the SPFs of these extrasolar debris disks is challenging because\nonly a limited range of scattering angles are visible to Earth-based observers.\nBy contrast, Saturn's tenuous rings can be observed over a much broader range\nof geometries, so their SPFs can be much better constrained. Since these rings\nare composed of small particles released from the surfaces of larger bodies,\nthey are reasonable analogs to debris disks and so their SPFs can provide\ninsights into the plausible scattering properties of debris disks. This work\nexamines two of Saturn's dusty rings: the G ring (at 167,500 km from Saturn's\ncenter) and the D68 ringlet (at 67,600 km). Using data from the cameras onboard\nthe Cassini spacecraft, we are able to estimate the rings' brightnesses at\nscattering angles ranging from 170 to 0.5 degrees. We find that both of the\nrings exhibit extremely strong forward-scattering peaks, but for scattering\nangles above 60 degrees their brightnesses are nearly constant. These SPFs can\nbe well approximated by a linear combination of three Henyey-Greenstein\nfunctions, and are roughly consistent with the SPFs of irregular particles from\nlaboratory measurements. Comparing these data to Fraunhofer and Mie models\nhighlights several challenges involved in extracting information about particle\ncompositions and size distributions from SPFs alone. The SPFs of these rings\nalso indicate that the degree of forward scattering in debris disks may be\ngreatly underestimated.",

For the relatively slower CMEs, we find that\ndrag-based models initiated below heliocentric distances ranging from 15 to 50\n$R_{\\odot}$ cannot account for the observed CME trajectories.

The bulk of this report is a description of the portion of PCK\nand SPK formats required for these ephemerides. New SPK and PCK data types,\nboth called Type 20: Chebyshev (Velocity Only), have been added.

We use the first-order structure function,\n$SF(\\delta t)$, to fit both light curves to the damped power-law PSD of\nKasliwal, Vogeley & Richards, 2015. On short timescales, we find a steeper\nlog-PSD slope ($\\gamma = 2.90$ to within $10$ percent) for the re-processed\nlight curve as compared to the light curve found on MAST ($\\gamma = 2.65$ to\nwithin $10$ percent)---both inconsistent with a damped random walk which\nrequires $\\gamma = 2$. The log-PSD slope inferred for the re-processed light\ncurve is consistent with previous results (Carini & Ryle, 2012, Williams &\nCarini, 2015) that study the same re-processed light curve. The turnover\ntimescale is almost identical for both light curves ($27.1$ and $27.5$~d for\nthe reprocessed and MAST database light curves). Based on the obvious visual\ndifference between the two versions of the light curve and on the PSD model\nfits, we conclude that there remain significant levels of spacecraft-induced\neffects in the standard pipeline reduction of the Kepler data.

The SuperMAG auroral electroject SME index, an\nenhanced version of the traditional AE index, is used as an auroral power (AP)\nindicator. AP intensity jumps triggered by shock impacts are correlated with\nboth shock speed and impact angle. It is found that high AP intensity events\ntypically occur when high speed IP shocks impact the Earths magnetosphere with\nthe shock normal almost parallel to the Sun-Earth line. This result suggests\nthat symmetric and strong magnetospheric compression leads to favorable\nconditions for intense auroral power release, as shown previously by\nsimulations and observations. Some potential mechanisms will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Mars flyby of C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) represented a unique opportunity\nfor imaging a long-period comet and resolving its nucleus and rotation period.\nBecause of the small encounter distance and the high relative velocity, the\ngoal of successfully observing C/2013 A1 from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts\nposed strict accuracy requirements on the comet's ephemerides. These\nrequirements were hard to meet, as comets are known for being highly\nunpredictable: astrometric observations can be significantly biased and\nnongravitational perturbations affect comet trajectories. Therefore, even prior\nto the encounter, we remeasured a couple of hundred astrometric images obtained\nwith ground-based and Earth-orbiting telescopes. We also observed the comet\nwith the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science\nExperiment (HiRISE) camera on 2014 October 7. In particular, these HiRISE\nobservations were decisive in securing the trajectory and revealed that\nout-of-plane nongravitational perturbations were larger than previously\nassumed. Though the resulting ephemeris predictions for the Mars encounter\nallowed observations of the comet from the Mars orbiting spacecrafts,\npost-encounter observations show a discrepancy with the pre-encounter\ntrajectory. We reconcile this discrepancy by employing the Rotating Jet Model,\nwhich is a higher fidelity model for nongravitational perturbations and\nprovides an estimate of C/2013 A1's spin pole.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper is the result of the International Cometary Workshop, held in\nToulouse, France in April 2014, where the participants came together to assess\nour knowledge of comets prior to the ESA Rosetta Mission. In this paper, we\nlook at the composition of the gas and dust from the comae of comets. With the\ngas, we cover the various taxonomic studies that have broken comets into groups\nand compare what is seen at all wavelengths. We also discuss what has been\nlearned from mass spectrometers during flybys. A few caveats for our\ninterpretation are discussed. With dust, much of our information comes from\nflybys. They include {\\it in situ} analyses as well as samples returned to\nEarth for laboratory measurements. Remote sensing IR observations and\npolarimetry are also discussed. For both gas and dust, we discuss what\ninstruments the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander will bring to bear to\nimprove our understanding of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as \"ground-truth\"\nfor our previous comprehensive studies. Finally, we summarize some of the\ninitial Rosetta Mission findings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A spacecraft pushed by radiation has the major advantage that the power\nsource is not included in the accelerated mass, making it the preferred\ntechnique for reaching relativistic speeds. There are two main technical\nchallenges. First, to get significant acceleration, the sail must be both\nextremely light weight and capable of operating at high intensities of the\nincident beam and the resulting high temperatures. Second, the transmitter must\nemit high power beams through huge apertures, many kilometers in diameter, in\norder to focus radiation on the sail across the long distances needed to\nachieve high final speeds. Existing proposals for the sail use carbon or\naluminum films, but aluminum is limited by a low melting point, and both have\nlow mechanical strength requiring either a distributed payload or complex\nrigging. We propose here a graphene sail, which offers high absorption per unit\nweight, high temperature operation, and the mechanical strength to support\nsimple rigging to a lumped mass payload. For the transmitter, existing\nproposals use a compact high power source, and focus the energy with a large\n(hundreds to thousands of km) space-based lens. Existing optical drive\nproposals also require launch from the outer solar system, have severe pointing\nrestrictions, and require difficult maneuvering of the beam source. Instead we\npropose an active Fresnel lens, allowing smaller apertures of less mass, easier\npointing with fewer restrictions, and probe launch from the inner solar system.\nThe technologies for both the sail and the transmitter are already under\ndevelopment for other reasons. Worked examples, physically smaller and less\nmassive than those suggested so far, range from a 1kg payload launched to 10\\%\nof the speed of light by a transmitter only 25 times the mass of ISS, to a\nlarger system that can launch a 1000 kg payload to 50\\% of the speed of light.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We consider the best today available observations of the Sun free of\nturbulent Earth atmospheric effects, taken with the Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT) onboard the Hinode spacecraft. Both the instrumental smearing and the\nobserved stray light are analyzed in order to improve the resolution. The Point\nSpread Function (PSF) corresponding to the blue continuum Broadband Filter\nImager (BFI) near 450 nm is deduced by analyzing i/ the limb of the Sun and ii/\nimages taken during the transit of the planet Venus in 2012. A combination of\nGaussian and Lorentzian functions is selected to construct a PSF in order to\nremove both smearing due to the instrumental diffraction effects (PSF core) and\nthe large-angle stray light due to the spiders and central obscuration (wings\nof the PSF) that are responsible for the parasitic stray light. A\nMax-likelihood deconvolution procedure based on an optimum number of iterations\nis discussed. It is applied to several solar field images, including the\ngranulation near the limb. The normal non-magnetic granulation is compared to\nthe abnormal granulation which we call magnetic. A new feature appearing for\nthe first time at the extreme- limb of the disk (the last 100 km) is discussed\nin the context of the definition of the solar edge and of the solar diameter. A\nsingle sunspot is considered in order to illustrate how effectively the\nrestoration works on the sunspot core. A set of 125 consecutive deconvolved\nimages is assembled in a 45 min long movie illustrating the complexity of the\ndynamical behavior inside and around the sunspot.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic reconnection, a change of magnetic field connectivity, is a\nfundamental physical process in which magnetic energy is released explosively.\nIt is responsible for various eruptive phenomena in the universe. However, this\nprocess is difficult to observe directly. Here, the magnetic topology\nassociated with a solar reconnection event is studied in three dimensions (3D)\nusing the combined perspectives of two spacecraft. The sequence of extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) images clearly shows that two groups of oppositely directed\nand non-coplanar magnetic loops gradually approach each other, forming a\nseparator or quasi-separator and then reconnecting. The plasma near the\nreconnection site is subsequently heated from $\\sim$1 to $\\ge$5 MK. Shortly\nafterwards, warm flare loops ($\\sim$3 MK) appear underneath the hot plasma.\nOther observational signatures of reconnection, including plasma inflows and\ndownflows, are unambiguously revealed and quantitatively measured. These\nobservations provide direct evidence of magnetic reconnection in a 3D\nconfiguration and reveal its origin.",
