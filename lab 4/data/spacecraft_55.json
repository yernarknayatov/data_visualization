Our analysis shows, for the first time, that kinetic-scale\nfluctuations play a significant role in the Mercury's magnetosphere up to the\nlargest resolvable time scale ~20 s imposed by the signal nonstationarity,\nsuggesting that turbulence at this planet is largely controlled by finite\nLarmor radius effects. In particular, we report the presence of a highly\nturbulent and extended foreshock system filled with packets of ULF\noscillations, broad-band intermittent fluctuations in the magnetosheath,\nion-kinetic turbulence in the central plasma sheet of Mercury's magnetotail,\nand kinetic-scale fluctuations in the inner current sheet encountered at the\noutbound (dawn-side) magnetopause. Overall, our measurements indicate that the\nHermean magnetosphere, as well as the surrounding region, are strongly affected\nby non-MHD effects introduced by finite sizes of cyclotron orbits of the\nconstituting ion species. Physical mechanisms of these effects and their\npotentially critical impact on the structure and dynamics of Mercury's magnetic\nfield remain to be understood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Between 2004 and 2007 the instruments of the CASSINI spacecraft discovered\nhydrocarbon lakes in the polar regions of Titan. We have developed a\nlake-atmosphere equilibrium model allowing the determination of the chemical\ncomposition of these liquid areas. The model is based on uncertain\nthermodynamic data and precipitation rates of organic species predicted to be\npresent in the lakes and seas that are subject to spatial and temporal\nvariations. Here we explore and discuss the influence of these uncertainties\nand variations. The errors and uncertainties relevant to thermodynamic data are\nsimulated via Monte-Carlo simulations. Global Circulation Models (GCM) are also\nemployed in order to investigate the possibility of chemical asymmetry between\nthe south and the north poles, due to differences in precipitation rates. We\nfind that mole fractions of compounds in the liquid phase have a high\nsensitivity to thermodynamic data used as inputs, in particular molar volumes\nand enthalpies of vaporization. When we combine all considered uncertainties,\nthe ranges of obtained mole fractions are rather large (up to ~8500%) but the\ndistributions of values are narrow. The relative standard deviations remain\nbetween 10% and ~300% depending on the compound considered. Compared to other\nsources of uncertainties and variability, deviation caused by surface pressure\nvariations are clearly negligible, remaining of the order of a few percent up\nto ~20%. Moreover no significant difference is found between the composition of\nlakes located in north and south poles. Because the theory of regular solutions\nemployed here is sensitive to thermodynamic data and is not suitable for polar\nmolecules such as HCN and CH3CN, our work strongly underlines the need for\nexperimental simulations and the improvement of Titan's atmospheric models.",

There are also density and magnetic field variations in the far wake,\nmaybe from an ion beam instability related to the wake refill. The results are\ncompared to observations by the WIND spacecraft during a wake crossing. The\nmodel magnetic field and ion velocities are in agreement with the measurements.\nThe density and the electron temperature in the central wake are not as well\ncaptured by the model, probably from the lack of electron physics in the hybrid\nmodel.",

In\nthis paper, we present our orbit selection with one Venus swing-by together\nwith orbit simulation. In Paper I, our orbit choice is with two Venus\nswing-bys. The present choice takes shorter time (about 250 days) to reach the\nopposite side of the Sun. We also present a preliminary design of the optical\nbench, and elaborate on the solar physics goals with the radiation monitor\npayload. We discuss telescope size, trade-offs of drag-free sensitivities,\nthermal issues and present an outlook. ASTROD I is a planned interplanetary\nspace mission with multiple goals. The primary aims are: to test General\nRelativity with an improvement in sensitivity of over 3 orders of magnitude,\nimproving our understanding of gravity and aiding the development of a new\nquantum gravity theory; to measure key solar system parameters with increased\naccuracy, advancing solar physics and our knowledge of the solar system; and to\nmeasure the time rate of change of the gravitational constant with an order of\nmagnitude improvement and the anomalous Pioneer acceleration, thereby probing\ndark matter and dark energy gravitationally. It is envisaged as the first in a\nseries of ASTROD missions. ASTROD I will consist of one spacecraft carrying a\ntelescope, four lasers, two event timers and a clock. Two-way, two-wavelength\nlaser pulse ranging will be used between the spacecraft in a solar orbit and\ndeep space laser stations on Earth, to achieve the ASTROD I goals.",

At present what makes\nthe fast wind fast and the slow wind slow still remains to be answered. While a\nrobust empirical correlation exists between the coronal expansion rate $f_c$ of\nthe flow tubes and the speeds $v$ measured in situ, further data analysis\nsuggests that $v$ depends on more than just $f_c$. We examine whether the\nnon-radial shape of field lines, which naturally accompanies any non-radial\nexpansion, could be an additional geometrical factor. We solved the transport\nequations incorporating the heating due to turbulent Alfv\u00e9n waves for an\nelectron-proton solar wind along curved field lines given by an analytical\nmagnetic field model, representative of a solar minimum corona. The field line\nshape is found to influence substantially the solar wind parameters, reducing\nthe asymptotic speed by up to $\\sim 130$ km s$^{-1}$, or by $\\sim 28%$ in\nrelative terms, compared with the case neglecting the field line curvature.\nThis effect was interpreted in the general framework of energy addition in the\nsolar wind: Relative to the straight case, the field line curvature enhances\nthe effective energy deposition to the subsonic flow, resulting in a higher\nproton flux and a lower terminal proton speed. Our computations suggest that\nthe field line curvature could be a geometrical factor which, in addition to\nthe tube expansion, substantially influences the solar wind speed. Furthermore,\nat solar minima although the field line curvature unlikely affects the polar\nfast solar wind, it does help make the wind at low latitudes slow, thereby\nhelping better reproduce the Ulysses measurements.",

The Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nTelescope (EIT) of solar corona on-board SOHO spacecraft has uncovered a new\nclass of eruptive events which are often identified as signatures of Coronal\nMass Ejection (CME) initiations on solar disk. It is evident that a crucial\ntask is the development of an automatic detection tool of CMEs precursors. The\nNovel EIT wave Machine Observing (NEMO) (this http URL) code is an\noperational tool that detects automatically solar eruptions using EIT image\nsequences. NEMO applies techniques based on the general statistical properties\nof the underlying physical mechanisms of eruptive events on the solar disc. In\nthis work, the most recent updates of NEMO code - that have resulted to the\nincrease of the recognition efficiency of solar eruptions linked to CMEs - are\npresented. These updates provide calculations of the surface of the dimming\nregion, implement novel clustering technique for the dimmings and set new\ncriteria to flag the eruptive dimmings based on their complex characteristics.\nThe efficiency of NEMO has been increased significantly resulting to the\nextraction of dimmings observed near the solar limb and to the detection of\nsmall-scale events as well. As a consequence, the detection efficiency of CMEs\nprecursors and the forecasts of CMEs have been drastically improved.\nFurthermore, the catalogues of solar eruptive events that can be constructed by\nNEMO may include larger number of physical parameters associated to the dimming\nregions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Coronal plumes, which extend from solar coronal holes (CH) into the high\ncorona and - possibly - into the solar wind (SW), can now continuously be\nstudied with modern telescopes and spectrometers on spacecraft, in addition to\ninvestigations from the ground, in particular, during total eclipses. Despite\nthe large amount of data available on these prominent features and related\nphenomena, many questions remained unanswered as to their generation and\nrelative contributions to the high-speed streams emanating from CHs. An\nunderstanding of the processes of plume formation and evolution requires a\nbetter knowledge of the physical conditions at the base of CHs, in plumes and\nin the surrounding inter-plume regions (IPR). More specifically, information is\nneeded on the magnetic field configuration, the electron densities and\ntemperatures, effective ion temperatures, non-thermal motions, plume\ncross-sections relative to the size of a CH, the plasma bulk speeds, as well as\nany plume signatures in the SW. In spring 2007, the authors proposed a study on\n\"Structure and dynamics of coronal plumes and inter-plume regions in solar\ncoronal holes\" to the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern to\nclarify some of these aspects by considering relevant observations and the\nextensive literature. This review summarizes the results and conclusions of the\nstudy. Stereoscopic observations allowed us to include three-dimensional\nreconstructions of plumes. Multi-instrument investigations carried out during\nseveral campaigns led to progress in some areas, such as plasma densities,\ntemperatures, plume structure and the relation to other solar phenomena, but\nnot all questions could be answered concerning the details of plume generation\nprocess(es) and interaction with the SW.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar flares radiates energy at all wavelengths, but the spectral\ndistribution of this energy is still poorly known. White-light continuum\nemission is sometimes observed and the flares are then termed \"white-light\nflares\" (WLF). In this paper, we investigate if all flares are white-light\nflares and how is the radiated energy spectrally distributed. We perform a\nsuperposed epoch analysis of spectral and total irradiance measurements\nobtained since 1996 by the SOHO and GOES spacecrafts at various wavelength,\nfrom Soft X-ray to the visible domain. The long-term record of solar irradiance\nand excellent duty cycle of the measurements allow us to detect a signal in\nvisible irradiance even for moderate (C-class) flares, mainly during the\nimpulsive phase. We identify this signal as continuum emission emitted by\nwhite-light flares, and find that it is consistent with a blackbody emission at\n~9000K. We estimate for several sets of flares the contribution of the WL\ncontinuum and find it to be of ~70% of the total radiated energy. We re-analyse\nthe X17 flare that occurred on 28 October 2003 and find similar results. This\npaper brings evidence that all flares are white-light flares and that the\nwhite-light continuum is the main contributor to the total radiated energy;\nthis continuum is consistent with blackbody spectrum at ~9000K. These\nobservational results are important in order to understand the physical\nmechanisms during flares and open the way to a possible contribution of flares\nto TSI variations.",

The Sheperding Spacecraft (SSC) separated \\sim9 hours before impact\nand performed a small braking maneuver in order to observe the Centaur impact\nplume, looking for evidence of water and other volatiles, before impacting\nitself. This paper describes the registration of imagery of the LCROSS impact\nregion from the mid- and near-infrared cameras onboard the SSC, as well as from\nthe Goldstone radar. We compare the Centaur impact features, positively\nidentified in the first two, and with a consistent feature in the third, which\nare interpreted as a 20 m diameter crater surrounded by a 160 m diameter ejecta\nregion. The images are registered to Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter (LRO)\ntopographical data which allows determination of the impact location. This\nlocation is compared with the impact location derived from ground-based\ntracking and propagation of the spacecraft's trajectory and with locations\nderived from two hybrid imagery/trajectory methods. The four methods give a\nweighted average Centaur impact location of -84.6796\\circ, -48.7093\\circ, with\na 1{\\sigma} un- certainty of 115 m along latitude, and 44 m along longitude,\njust 146 m from the target impact site. Meanwhile, the trajectory-derived SSC\nimpact location is -84.719\\circ, -49.61\\circ, with a 1{\\sigma} uncertainty of 3\nm along the Earth vector and 75 m orthogonal to that, 766 m from the target\nlocation and 2.803 km south-west of the Centaur impact. We also detail the\nCentaur impact angle and SSC instrument pointing errors. Six high-level LCROSS\nmission requirements are shown to be met by wide margins. We hope that these\nresults facilitate further analyses of the LCROSS experiment data and follow-up\nobservations of the impact region.",

We perform time-series\nanalysis on the nearly continuous month-long Kepler datasets of these 5\nobjects; these datasets provide nearly alias-free time-series photometry at\nunprecedented precision. Following an iterative prewhitening process we derive\nthe pulsational frequency spectra of these stars, separating out artefacts of\nknown instrumental origin. We find that these new pulsating sdB stars are\nmultiperiodic long-period pulsators of the V1093 Her type, with the number of\nperiodicities ranging from 8 (KIC8302197) to 53 (KIC11558725). The frequencies\nand amplitudes are typical of g-mode pulsators of this type. We do not find any\nevidence for binarity in the five stars from their observed pulsation\nfrequencies. As these are g-mode pulsators, we briefly looked for period\nspacings for mode identification, and found average spacings about 260s and\n145s. This may indicate l=1 and 2 patterns. Some modes may show evidence of\nrotational splitting. These discoveries complete the list of compact pulsators\nfound in the survey phase. Of the 13 compact pulsators, only one star was\nidentified as a short-period (p-mode) V361Hya pulsator, while all other new\npulsators turned out to be V1093 Her class objects. Among the latter objects,\ntwo of them seemed to be pure V1093 Her while the others show additional low\namplitude peaks in the p-mode frequency range, suggesting their hybrid nature.\nAuthenticity of these peaks will be tested with longer runs currently under\nanalysis.",

The wave is\nmore pronounced in the eastern propagation direction, and is thus, better\nobservable in STEREO-B images. From STEREO-B observations we derive two\nseparate initiation centers for the wave, and their locations fit with the\ncoronal dimming regions. Assuming a simple geometry of the wave we reconstruct\nits 3D nature from combined STEREO-A and STEREO-B observations. We find that\nthe wave structure is asymmetric with an inclination towards East. The\nassociated CME has a deprojected speed of ~750+/-50 km/s, and shows a\nnon-radial outward motion towards the East with respect to the underlying\nsource region location. Applying the forward fitting model developed by\nThernisien, Howard, and Vourlidas (2006), we derive the CME flux rope position\non the solar surface to be close to the dimming regions. We conclude that the\nexpanding flanks of the CME most likely drive and shape the coronal wave.",

The response of each detector in\nturn is also investigated. Results: We find that on 2004 November 6 the\nobserved oscillations correspond to the nutation period of the RHESSI\ninstrument. These oscillations are also of greatest amplitude for detector 5,\nwhile in the lightcurves of many other detectors the oscillations are small or\nundetectable. We also find that the variation in detector pointing is much\nlarger during this flare than the counterexample of 2004 November 4.\nConclusions: Sufficiently large nutation motions of the RHESSI spacecraft lead\nto clearly observable oscillations in count rates, posing a significant hazard\nfor data analysis. This issue is particularly problematic for detector 5 due to\nits design characteristics. Dynamic correction of the RHESSI counts, accounting\nfor the livetime, data gaps, and the transmission of the bi-grid collimator of\neach detector, is required to overcome this issue. These corrections should be\napplied to all future oscillation studies.",

These spectra show a narrow\noptical depth minimum at wavelengths around 2.87 microns. This minimum is\nlikely due to the Christiansen Effect, a reduction in the extinction of small\nparticles when their (complex) refractive index is close to that of the\nsurrounding medium. Simple Mie-scattering models demonstrate that the strength\nof this opacity dip is sensitive to the size distribution of particles between\n1 and 100 microns across. Furthermore, the spatial resolution of the\noccultation data is sufficient to reveal variations in the transmission spectra\nwithin and among these rings. For example, in both the Encke Gap ringlets and F\nring, the opacity dip weakens with increasing local optical depth, which is\nconsistent with the larger particles being concentrated near the cores of these\nrings. The strength of the opacity dip varies most dramatically within the F\nring; certain compact regions of enhanced optical depth lack an opacity dip and\ntherefore appear to have a greatly reduced fraction of grains in the few-micron\nsize range.Such spectrally-identifiable structures probably represent a subset\nof the compact optically-thick clumps observed by other Cassini instruments.\nThese variations in the ring's particle size distribution can provide new\ninsights into the processes of grain aggregation, disruption and transport\nwithin dusty rings. For example, the unusual spectral properties of the F-ring\nclumps could perhaps be ascribed to small grains adhering onto the surface of\nlarger particles in regions of anomalously low velocity dispersion.",

Since other planets and solar-system\nbodies also perturb the orbits of LISA spacecraft and affect the time delay\ninterferometry (TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically in this paper for\nall solutions with the generation number n \\leq 3. We have worked out a set of\n3-year optimized mission orbits of LISA spacecraft starting at January 1, 2021\nusing the CGC2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use this numerical solution to\ncalculate the residual optical path differences in the second-generation\nsolutions of our previous paper, and compare with the semi-analytic error\nestimate. The accuracy of this calculation is better than 1 cm (or 30 ps). The\nmaximum path length difference, for all configuration calculated, is below 1 m\n(3 ns). This is well below the limit under which the laser frequency noise is\nrequired to be suppressed.

These data mimic what we will see when we point next-generation\nspace telescopes at nearby exoplanets. We use principal component analysis\n(PCA) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneities\nand map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as a\ncomplement to the equatorial views presented in Cowan et al. (2009). We also\nperform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves\nfrom NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This\nnumerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA\ncan robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar\nbroadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent\nalbedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to\nmid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes\nemphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the\nmid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at\nshort wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor\nin the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a\nsnowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the\nmodern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not\nnoticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short\nwavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in\nthose wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color\nvariations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day\nEarth, regardless of viewing angle.",

Asymptotic limits for gravity (g-)mode pulsations provide\nrelationships between equal period spacings of modes with differing degrees and\nrelationships between periods of the same radial order but differing degrees.\nPeriod transforms, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and linear least-squares fits have\nbeen used to detect and determine the significance of equal period spacings. We\nhave also used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the likelihood that the\ndetected spacings could be produced randomly.\nPeriod transforms for nine of the Kepler stars indicate ell=1 period\nspacings, with five also showing peaks for ell=2 modes. 12 stars indicate ell=1\nmodes using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test while another shows solely ell=2 modes.\nMonte Carlo results indicate that equal period spacings are significant in 10\nstars above 99% confidence and 13 of the 14 are above 94% confidence. For 12\nstars, the various methods find consistent regular period spacing values to\nwithin the errors, two others show some inconsistencies, likely caused by\nbinarity, and the last has significant detections but the mode assignment\ndisagrees between methods.\nWe find a common ell=1 period spacing spanning a range from 231 to 272 s\nallowing us to correlate pulsation modes with 222 periodicities and that the\nell=2 period spacings are related to the ell=1 spacings by the asymptotic\nrelationship $1/\\sqrt{3}$. We briefly discuss the impact of equal period\nspacings which indicate low-degree modes with a lack of significant mode\ntrappings.",

On a limited number of objects, the spatial resolution allows for\ndirect measurement of the size or even surface mapping with a resolution down\nto 13 milliarcseconds.

In this retarded\ngravitation theory (RGT), the gravitational force depends upon both retarded\nposition and velocity, and the equations of motion are time-asymmetric retarded\nfunctional differential equations. We explicitly solve these equations, under\nsimplifying assumptions, for various NASA spacecraft. This shows that the\ndifferences from Newtonian gravity, though tiny within the solar system, are\njust appropriate to explain the flyby anomaly as a v/c effect due to earth's\nrotation. The differences can, however, be large in the case of a spiral\ngalaxy, and we show that the combined velocity drag from a large number of\nco-rotating stars enormously speeds up a test particle. Thus, the non-Newtonian\nbehaviour of rotation curves in a spiral galaxy may be explained as being due\nto velocity drag rather than dark matter. RGT can also be tested in the\nlaboratory. It necessitates a reappraisal of current laboratory methods of\ndetermining the Newtonian gravitational constant G. Since RGT makes no\nspeculative assumptions, its refutation would have serious implications across\nphysics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  It was found out that the distribution's shape of the in-ecliptic (as well as\nradial) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) significantly\nchanges with the heliocentric distance, which poorly corresponds to classical\nmodels of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) expansion.\nFor example, distributions of the radial photospheric and the source surface's\nmagnetic field in the ecliptic plane are Gaussian-like, the distribution of the\nradial IMF component at the Earth orbit demonstrates two-humped shape, and it\nbecomes again Gaussian-like at 3-4 AU. These differences lead to lack of\ncorrespondence between simulations of the IMF behaviour at 1 AU and\nobservations. Our results indicate that picture of the IMF expansion into space\nis more complicated than usually considered, and the sector structure is not\nthe only source of the two-humped shape of the in-ecliptic or radial IMF\ncomponent. We have analysed data from different spacecraft at the distances\nfrom 0.29 AU to 4 AU and found that the shape of the radial IMF component\ndistribution strongly depends on a heliocentric distance and a heliolatitude.\nThe \"two-humped IMF\" effect is most brightly expressed at low heliolatitudes at\n0.7-2 AU, but it fully disappears at 3-4 AU. There is also dependence of the\nIMF distributions' view on a solar cycle due to active processes, such as solar\nflares and CMEs. We suppose that the in-ecliptic solar wind field at 1 AU is\ninfluenced by solar active regions in a high degree, and actually the\ndistribution is the three-humped: two humps correspond to the IMF from the\nmiddle and high heliolatitudes and the third one is the theoretically expected\ndistribution from the solar field nearby the heliomagnetic equator. Vanishing\nof the IMF zero-component with the distance from the Sun partially could be a\nresult of a magnetic reconnection at the current sheets in the solar wind.",

We conclude that the appearance and\ndisappearance of the Evershed flow and penumbra grains occur at nearly the same\ntime and are associated with changes of the inclination angle of the magnetic\nfield from vertical to more horizontal. This supports the idea that Evershed\nflow is a result of thermal convection in the inclined field lines. The dark\ncore of the bright penumbral filament also appears coincidental with the\nEvershed flow. However, the dark-cored bright filament survives at least for\n10-20 minutes after the disappearance of the Evershed flow. The heat input into\nthe bright filament continues after the end of heat transfer by the Evershed\nflow. This suggests that local heating along the bright filament is important\nto maintain the brightness of the bright filament in addition to the heat\ntransfer by the Evershed flow.",

The sense of\ntwist in both the prominences is determined from the changes in latitudes and\nlongitudes of the reconstructed features.

Increase in height before and during the\neruption allowed us to study kinematics of the prominences in the two phases of\neruption, the slow rise and the fast eruptive phase. A constant value of\nacceleration was found for each reconstructed feature in each phase, but it\nshowed significant change from one leg to the other in both the prominences.\nThe magnitude of acceleration during the eruptive phase is found to be\ncommensurate with the net effect of the two motions stated above.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On 17 October 2008, the Cassini spacecraft crossed the southern sources of\nSaturn kilometric radiation (SKR), while flying along high-latitude nightside\nmagnetic field lines. In situ measurements allowed us to characterize for the\nfirst time the source region of an extra-terrestrial auroral radio emission.\nUsing radio, magnetic field and particle observations, we show that SKR sources\nare surrounded by a hot tenuous plasma, in a region of upward field-aligned\ncurrents. Magnetic field lines supporting radio sources map a continuous,\nhigh-latitude and spiral-shaped auroral oval observed on the dawnside,\nconsistent with enhanced auroral activity. Investigating the Cyclotron Maser\nInstability (CMI) as a mechanism responsible for SKR generation, we find that\nobserved cutoff frequencies are consistent with radio waves amplified\nperpendicular to the magnetic field by hot (6 to 9 keV) resonant electrons,\nmeasured locally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  To better understand the dynamical process of active-region filament\neruptions and associated flares and CMEs, we carried out a statistical study of\n120 events observed by BBSO, TRACE, and t(SOHO/EIT) from 1998 to 2007 and\ncombined filament observations with the NOAA's flare reports, MDI magnetograms,\nand LASCO data, to investigate the relationship between active-region filament\neruptions and other solar activities. We found that 115 out of 120 filament\neruptions are associated with flares. 56 out of 105 filament eruptions are\nfound to be associated with CMEs except for 15 events without corresponding\nLASCO data. We note the limitation of coronagraphs duo to geometry or\nsensitivity, leading to many smaller CMEs that are Earth-directed or well out\nof the plane of sky not being detected by near-Earth spacecraft. Excluding\nthose without corresponding LASCO data, the CME association rate of\nactive-region filament eruptions clearly increases with X-ray flare class from\nabout 32% for C-class flares to 100% for X-class flares. The eruptions of\nactive-region filaments associated with Halo CMEs are often accompanied by\nlarge flares. About 92% events associated with X-class flare are associated\nwith Halo CMEs. Such a result is due to that the Earth-directed CMEs detected\nas Halo CMEs are often the larger CMEs and many of the smaller ones are not\ndetected because of the geometry and low intensity. The average speed of the\nassociated CMEs of filament eruptions increases with X-ray flare size from\n563.7 km/s for C-class flares to 1506.6 km/s for X-class flares. Moreover, the\nmagnetic emergence and cancellation play an important role in triggering\nfilament eruptions. These findings may be instructive to not only in respect to\nthe modeling of active-region filament eruptions but also in predicting flares\nand CMEs.",

We observed 244(65) whistler waves using electric(magnetic) field data\nfrom the Wind spacecraft finding ~40%(~62%) of the waves have peak-to-peak\namplitudes of >/- 50 mV/m(>/- 0.5 nT). We present an example waveform capture\nof the largest magnetic field amplitude (>/- 8 nT peak-to-peak) whistler wave\never reported in the radiation belts. The estimated Poynting flux magnitude\nassociated with this wave is >/- 300 microW/m^2, roughly four orders of\nmagnitude above previous estimates. Such large Poynting flux values are\nconsistent with rapid energization of electrons. The majority of the largest\namplitude whistlers occur during magnetically active periods (AE > 200 nT). The\nwaves were observed to exhibit a broad range of propagation angles with respect\nto the magnetic field, 0\u00b0 </- {\\theta}_kB < 90\u00b0, which showed no\nconsistent variation with magnetic latitude. These results are inconsistent\nwith the idea that the whistlers are all generated at the equator, propagating\nalong the magnetic field, and that the observed obliqueness is due to\npropagation effects. We also identified three types of electron distributions\nobserved simultaneously with the whistler waves including beam-like,\nbeam/flattop, and anisotropic distributions. The whistlers exhibited different\ncharacteristics depending on the observed electron distributions. The majority\nof the waveforms observed in our study have f/f_ce </- 0.5 and are observed\nprimarily in the radiation belts simultaneously with anisotropic electron\ndistributions.",

In particular, we discuss the steps involved in reducing the data from\ntelemetry packets to cleaned, calibrated, time-ordered data (TOD) and frequency\nmaps. Data are continuously calibrated using the modulation of the temperature\nof the cosmic microwave background radiation induced by the motion of the\nspacecraft. Noise properties are estimated from TOD from which the sky signal\nhas been removed using a generalized least square map-making algorithm.\nMeasured 1/f noise knee-frequencies range from 100mHz at 30GHz to a few tens of\nmHz at 70GHz. A destriping code (Madam) is employed to combine radiometric data\nand pointing information into sky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated\nnoise. Noise covariance matrices required to compute statistical uncertainties\non LFI and Planck products are also produced. Main beams are estimated down to\nthe approx -10dB level using Jupiter transits, which are also used for\ngeometrical calibration of the focal plane.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The performance of the Planck instruments in space is enabled by their low\noperating temperatures, 20K for LFI and 0.1K for HFI, achieved through a\ncombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.\nThe scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to two\ndetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.\nActive coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used by\nprevious cryogenic space missions (IRAS, COBE, ISO, Spitzer, AKARI), could not.\nRadiative cooling is provided by three V-groove radiators and a large telescope\nbaffle. The active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (<20K), a 4He\nJoule-Thomson cooler (4.7K), and a 3He-4He dilution cooler (1.4K and 0.1K). The\nflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space to\noperating conditions. The HFI bolometer plate reached 93mK on 3 July 2009, 50\ndays after launch. The solar panel always faces the Sun, shadowing the rest of\nPlanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384K. At the other end of the\nspacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3K and the telescope primary\nmirror operates at 35.9K. The temperatures of key parts of the instruments are\nstabilized by both active and passive methods. Temperature fluctuations are\ndriven by changes in the distance from the Sun, sorption cooler cycling and\nfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on the\ndilution and bolometer plates. These fluctuations do not compromise the science\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Recent spacecraft observations exploring solar system properties impact\nstandard paradigms of the formation of stars, planets and comets. We stress the\nunexpected cloud of microscopic dust resulting from the DEEP IMPACT mission,\nand the existence of molten nodules in STARDUST samples. And the theory of star\nformation does not explain the common occurrence of binary and multiple star\nsystems in the standard gas fragmentation scenario. No current theory of planet\nformation can explain the iron core of the earth, under oceans of water.\nThese difficulties are avoided in a scenario where the planet mass objects\nform primordially and are today the baryonic dark matter. They have been\ndetected in quasar microlensing and anomalous quasar radio brightening bursts.\nThe primordial planets often concentrate together to form a star, with residual\nmatter seen in pre-stellar accretion discs around the youngest stars.\nThese primordial planet mass bodies were formed of hydrogen-helium,\naggregated in dense clumps of a trillion at the time of plasma neutralization\n380,000 years after the big bang. Most have been frozen and invisible, but are\nnow manifesting themselves in numerous ways as sensitive modern space\ntelescopes become operational. Their key detection signature is their thermal\nemission spectrum, pegged at the 13.8 degrees Kelvin triple point of hydrogen,\nthe baryonic dark matter (Staplefeldt et al. 1999).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The primary focus of the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) collaboration between\nNASA and ESA is the detection of the temporal and spatial variation of the\natmospheric trace gases using a solar occultation Fourier transform\nspectrometer. To retrieve any trace gas mixing ratios from these measurements,\nthe atmospheric pressure and temperature have to be known accurately. Thus, a\nprototype retrieval model for the determination of pressure and temperature\nfrom a broadband high resolution infrared Fourier Transform spectrometer\nexperiment with the Sun as a source on board a spacecraft orbiting the planet\nMars is presented. It is found that the pressure and temperature can be\nuniquely solved from remote sensing spectroscopic measurements using a\nRegularized Total Least Squares method and selected pairs of micro-windows\nwithout any a-priori information of the state space parameters and other\nconstraints.\nThe selection of the pairs of suitable micro-windows is based on the\ninformation content analysis. A comparative information content calculation\nusing Bayes theory and a hyperspace formulation are presented to understand the\ninformation available in measurement. A method of minimization of mutual\ninformation is used to search the suitable micro-windows for a simultaneous\npressure and temperature retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We report for several solar energetic particle events intensity and\nanisotropy measurements of energetic electrons in the energy range ~ 27 to ~\n500 keV as observed with the Wind and ACE spacecraft in June 2000. The\nobservations onboard Wind show bimodal pitch angle distributions (PAD), whereas\nACE shows PADs with one peak, as usually observed for impulsive injection of\nelectrons at the Sun. During the time of observation Wind was located upstream\nof the Earth's bow shock, in the dawn - noon sector, at distances of ~ 40 to ~\n70 Earth radii away from the Earth, and magnetically well connected to the\nquasi-parallel bow shock, whereas ACE, located at the libration point L1, was\nnot connected to the bow shock. The electron intensity-time profiles and energy\nspectra show that the backstreaming electrons observed at Wind are not of\nmagnetospheric origin. The observations rather suggest that the bi-modal\nelectron PADs are due to reflection or scattering at an obstacle located at a\ndistance of less than ~ 150 Earth radii in the anti-sunward direction,\ncompatible with the bow shock or magnetosheath of the magnetosphere of the\nEarth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Observations of the Sun and of Sun-like stars provide access to different\naspects of stellar magnetic activity that, when combined, help us piece\ntogether a more comprehensive picture than can be achieved from only the solar\nor the stellar perspective. Where the Sun provides us with decent spatial\nresolution of, e.g., magnetic bipoles and the overlying dynamic, hot\natmosphere, the ensemble of stars enables us to see rare events on at least\nsome occasions. Where the Sun shows us how flux emergence, dispersal, and\ndisappearance occur in the complex mix of polarities on the surface, only\nstellar observations can show us the activity of the ancient or future Sun. In\nthis review, I focus on a comparison of statistical properties, from\nbipolar-region emergence to flare energies, and from heliospheric events to\nsolar energetic particle impacts on Earth. In doing so, I point out some\nintriguing correspondences as well as areas where our knowledge falls short of\nreaching unambiguous conclusions on, for example, the most extreme\nspace-weather events that we can expect from the present-day Sun. The\ndifficulties of interpreting stellar coronal light curves in terms of energetic\nevents are illustrated with some examples provided by the SDO, STEREO, and GOES\nspacecraft.",
