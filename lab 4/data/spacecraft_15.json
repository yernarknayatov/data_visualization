    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents a new algorithm for autonomous multitarget tracking of\nresident space objects using optical angles-only measurements from a spaceborne\nobserver. To enable autonomous angles-only navigation of spacecraft swarms, an\nobserver must be able to identify and track multiple known or unknown target\nspace objects in view, without reliance on a-priori relative orbit knowledge.\nExtremely high assignment precision is necessary with low measurement\nfrequencies and limited computational resources. The new \"Spacecraft\nAngles-only MUltitarget tracking System\" (SAMUS) algorithm has been developed\nto meet these objectives and constraints. It combines domain-specific modeling\nof target kinematics with multi-hypothesis techniques to autonomously track\nmultiple unknown targets using only sequential camera images. A measurement\ntransform ensures that target motion in the observer reference frame follows\nconsistent parametric models; curve fitting is used to predict track behavior;\nand kinematically-derived track gating and scoring criteria are applied to\nimprove the efficiency and accuracy of the multi-hypothesis approach.\nMonte-Carlo testing with high-fidelity simulations demonstrates close to 100%\nmeasurement assignment precision and strong recall across a range of\nmulti-spacecraft formations, in both near-circular and eccentric orbits.\nTracking is maintained in the presence of eclipse periods, significant\nmeasurement noise, and partially known swarm maneuvers. A comparison to other\ntracking algorithms reveals strong advantages in precision, robustness and\ncomputation time, crucial for spaceborne angles-only navigation.",

The problem is posed in relative orbit element\n(ROE) space, which yields insight into relative motion geometry and allows for\nthe straightforward inclusion of perturbations in linear time-variant form.\nReachable set theory is used to translate the cost-minimization problem into a\ngeometric path-planning problem and formulate the reachable delta-v minimum, a\nnew metric to assess optimality and quantify reachability of a maneuver scheme.\nNext, this paper presents a methodology to compute maneuver schemes that meet\nthis new optimality criteria and achieve a prescribed reconfiguration. Though\nthe methodology is applicable to any linear time-variant system, this paper\nleverages a state representation in ROE to derive new globally optimal maneuver\nschemes in orbits of arbitrary eccentricity. The methodology is also used to\ngenerate quantifiably sub-optimal solutions when the optimal solutions are\nunreachable. Further, this paper determines the mathematical impact of\nuncertainties on achieving the desired end state and provides a geometric\nvisualization of those effects on the reachable set.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Convective motions at the stellar surface generate a stochastic colored noise\nsource in the radial velocity (RV) data. This noise impedes the detection of\nsmall exoplanets. Moreover, the unknown statistics (amplitude, distribution)\nrelated to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false alarm probability\n(FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the\npossibility of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar\nconvection to design detection methods that can provide both a reliable\nestimate of the FAP and a high detection power. We tested the realism of 3D\nsimulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk\nintegrated velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO\nspacecraft. We presented a new detection method based on periodograms\nstandardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection tests\nto these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D\nsynthetic convective noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short\nperiods. For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP\nderived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized\nby 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work\n(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer\nbetter detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest\nperiodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with\neccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable\nsynthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series\ncan be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP\nof tests that are a critical element in the detection of exoplanets down to the\ncm/s level.",

Here we report on the April 18, 2014 CME that was associated with\na type II radio burst in the metric and interplanetary domains. We used the\nradio-burst data provided by the San Vito Solar Observatory of the Radio Solar\nTelescope Network and data from the Wind spacecraft. The CME is a full halo in\nthe field of view of the coronagraphs on board the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO). The CME was also observed by the coronagraphs on board the\nSolar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). We computed the CME shock and\nflux rope speeds based on the multi-view observations by the different\ncoronagraphs and by EUV instruments. We determined the shock speed from metric\nand interplanetary radio observations and found them to be consistent with\nwhite-light observations, provided the metric type II burst and its\ncontinuation into the decameter-hectometric domain are produced at the shock\nflanks, where the speed is still high enough to accelerate electrons that\nproduce the type II bursts. Interestingly, there was an interplanetary type II\nburst segment consistent with an origin at the shock nose suggesting that the\ncurved shock was crossing plasma levels separated by a few solar radii. We\nconclude that the CME speed is high enough to produce the interplanetary Type\nII burst and a solar energetic particle (SEP) event. However, the speed is not\nhigh enough to produce a ground level enhancement (GLE) event, which requires\nthe shock to form at a height of ~1.5 Rs.",

This process is\nwildly different from traditional space travel and trades large and slow\nspacecraft for small, fast, inexpensive, and fragile ones. The main goal of\nthese wafer satellites is to gather useful images during their deep space\njourney. We introduce and solve some of the main problems that accompany this\nconcept. First, we need an object detection system that can detect planets that\nwe have never seen before, some containing features that we may not even know\nexist in the universe. Second, once we have images of exoplanets, we need a way\nto take these images and rank them by importance. Equipment fails and data\nrates are slow, thus we need a method to ensure that the most important images\nto humankind are the ones that are prioritized for data transfer. Finally, the\nenergy on board is minimal and must be conserved and used sparingly. No\nexoplanet images should be missed, but using energy erroneously would be\ndetrimental. We introduce simulator-based methods that leverage artificial\nintelligence, mostly in the form of computer vision, in order to solve all\nthree of these issues. Our results confirm that simulators provide an extremely\nrich training environment that surpasses that of real images, and can be used\nto train models on features that have yet to be observed by humans. We also\nshow that the immersive and adaptable environment provided by the simulator,\ncombined with deep learning, lets us navigate and save energy in an otherwise\nimplausible way.",

It is important to get as much science as possible out of this\nlimited observing time. We provide an analysis framework (including publicly\nreleased computational tools) that can be used to optimize lists of exoplanet\ntargets for atmospheric characterization. Our tools take catalogs of planet\ndetections, either simulated, or actual; categorize the targets by planet\nradius and equilibrium temperature; estimate planet masses; generate model\nspectra and simulated instrument spectra; perform a statistical analysis to\ndetermine if the instrument spectra can confirm an atmospheric detection; and\nfinally, rank the targets within each category by observation time required.\nFor a catalog of simulated Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planet\ndetections, we determine an optimal target ranking for the observing time\navailable. Our results are generally consistent with other recent studies of\nJWST exoplanet target optimization. We show that assumptions about target\nplanet atmospheric metallicity, instrument performance (especially the noise\nfloor), and statistical detection threshold, can have a significant effect on\ntarget ranking. Over its full 10-year (fuel-limited) mission, JWST has the\npotential to increase the number of atmospheres characterized by transmission\nspectroscopy by an order of magnitude (from about 50 currently to between 400\nand 500).",

As the first confirmed objects originating outside of the\nsolar system, there are myriads of origin questions to explore and discuss,\nincluding where they came from, how did they get here and what are they\ncomposed of. Besides, there is a need to be cognizant especially if such\ninterstellar objects pass by the Earth of potential dangers of impact.\nSpecifically, in the case of Oumuamua, which was detected after its perihelion,\npassed by the Earth at around 0.2 AU, with an estimated excess speed of 60 km/s\nrelative to the Earth. Without enough forewarning time, a collision with such\nhigh-speed objects can pose a catastrophic danger to all life Earth. Such\nchallenges underscore the importance of detection and exploration systems to\nstudy these interstellar visitors. The detection system can include a\nspacecraft constellation with zenith-pointing telescope spacecraft. After an\nevent is detected, a spacecraft swarm can be deployed from Earth to flyby past\nthe visitor. The flyby can then be designed to perform a proximity operation of\ninterest. This work aims to develop algorithms to design these swarm missions\nthrough the IDEAS (Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of Swarms)\narchitecture. Specifically, we develop automated algorithms to design an\nEarth-based detection constellation and a spacecraft swarm that generates\ndetailed surface maps of the visitor during the rendezvous, along with their\nheliocentric cruise trajectories.",

The\nsimulation framework designed for assembly task is used to generate dataset for\ntraining the modified CNN models and, then results of different models are\ncompared with measure of how accurately models are predicting the pose. Unlike\nmany current approaches for spacecraft or object in space pose estimation, the\nmodel does not rely on hand-crafted object-specific features which makes this\nmodel more robust and easier to apply to other types of spacecraft.

Both these results indicate\na hierarchical relationship between CME kinematics and SEP event properties. In\nthis study, we expand the investigations to fluence spectra and the\nlongitudinal extent of metric type II associated SEP events including\nlow-intensity SEP events. We utilize SEP measurements of particle instruments\non the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft together with radio bursts\nobservations by ground-based radio observatories during solar cycle 24. Our\nresults show that low-intensity SEP events follow the hierarchy of spectral\nindex or the hierarchy of the starting frequency of type II radio bursts. We\nalso find indications of a trend between the onset frequency of metric type II\nbursts and the estimated longitudinal extent of the SEP events although the\nscatter of data points is quite large. These two results strongly support the\nidea of SEP acceleration by shocks. Stronger shocks develop closer to the Sun.",

Although earlier studies have suggested an asymmetry in the width of CMEs\nin orthogonal directions, this has not been inspected using multi-viewpoint\nobservations. Methods. We inspect the early evolution (below ten solar radii)\nof the morphology of a dozen CMEs occurring under specific conditions of\nobserving spacecraft location and CME trajectory, favorable to reduce\nuncertainties typically involved in the 3D reconstruction used here. These\nevents are carefully reconstructed by means of a forward modeling tool using\nsimultaneous observations of STEREO EUVI and SDO/AIA as input when originating\nlow in the corona, and followed up in the outer fields of view of the STEREO\nand the SOHO coronagraphs. We then examine the height evolution of the\nmorphological parameters arising from the reconstructions. Results. The\nmulti-viewpoint analysis of this set of CMEs revealed that their initial\nexpansion --below three solar radii-- is considerably asymmetric and\nnon-self-similar. Both angular widths, namely along the main axes of CMEs\n($AW_L$) and in the orthogonal direction ($AW_D$, representative of the flux\nrope diameter), exhibit much steeper change rates below this height, with the\ngrowth rate of $AW_L$ found to be larger than that of $AW_D$, also below that\nheight. Angular widths along the main axes of CMEs are on average $\\approx$1.8\ntimes larger than widths in the orthogonal direction $AW_D$. The ratios of the\ntwo expansion speeds, namely in the directions of CMEs main axes and in their\northogonal, are nearly constant in time after $\\sim$4 solar radii, with an\naverage ratio $\\approx$1.6. Heights at which the width change rate is defined\nto stabilize are greater for $AW_L$ than for $AW_D$.",

The core electrons and protons dominate in the\nmagnitude and change in the partial-to-total thermal pressure ratio, with the\ncore electrons often gaining as much or more than the protons. Only a moderate\npositive correlation is observed between the electron temperature and the\nkinetic energy change across the shock, while weaker, if any, correlations were\nfound with any other macroscopic shock parameter. No VDF parameter correlated\nwith the shock normal angle. The electron VDF evolves from a narrowly peaked\ncore with flaring suprathermal tails in the upstream to either a slightly\nhotter core with steeper tails or much hotter flattop core with even steeper\ntails downstream of the weaker and strongest shocks, respectively. Both\nquasi-static and fluctuating fields are examined as possible mechanisms\nmodifying the VDF but neither is sufficient alone. For instance, flattop VDFs\ncan be generated by nonlinear ion acoustic wave stochastic acceleration (i.e.,\ninelastic collisions) while other work suggested they result from the\ncombination of quasi-static and fluctuating fields.

Some of the most prominent sources for particle acceleration in our\nSolar System are large eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). These accelerated particles can generate radio\nemission through various mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by a\nvariety of solar radio bursts with different shapes and characteristics in\ndynamic spectra. Radio bursts directly associated with CMEs often show movement\nin the direction of CME expansion. Here, we aim to determine the emission\nmechanism of multiple moving radio bursts that accompanied a flare and CME that\ntook place on 14 June 2012. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nancay\nRadioheliograph, combined with observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nand Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, to analyse these moving\nradio bursts in order to determine their emission mechanism and\nthree-dimensional (3D) location with respect to the expanding CME. Results. In\nusing a 3D representation of the particle acceleration locations in relation to\nthe overlying coronal magnetic field and the CME propagation, for the first\ntime, we provide evidence that these moving radio bursts originate near the CME\nflanks and some that are possible signatures of shock-accelerated electrons\nfollowing the fast CME expansion in the low corona. Conclusions. The moving\nradio bursts, as well as other stationary bursts observed during the eruption,\noccur simultaneously with a type IV continuum in dynamic spectra, which is not\nusually associated with emission at the CME flanks. Our results show that\nmoving radio bursts that could traditionally be classified as moving type IVs\ncan represent shock signatures associated with CME flanks or plasma emission\ninside the CME behind its flanks, which are closely related to the lateral\nexpansion of the CME in the low corona.",

By tracing the\nlocations of the X-lines, we find the typical moving speed of the X-line\nendpoints is about 70~km/s, which is higher than but still comparable with the\nground-based observations.",

We combine self-consistent, numerical models of\nJupiter's equilibrium tidal response with observed Doppler shifts from the Juno\ngravity science experiment to test the sensitivity of the spacecraft to tides\nraised by the Galilean satellites and the Sun. The concentric Maclaurin\nspheroid (CMS) method finds the equilibrium shape and gravity field of a\nrotating, liquid planet with the tide raised by a satellite, expanded in Love\nnumbers ($k_{nm}$). We present improvements to CMS theory that eliminate an\nunphysical center of mass offset and study in detail the convergence behavior\nof the CMS approach. We demonstrate that the dependence of $k_{nm}$ with\norbital distance is important when considering the combined tidal response for\nJupiter. Conversely, the details of the interior structure have a negligible\ninfluence on $k_{nm}$, for models that match the zonal harmonics $J_2$, $J_4$\nand $J_6$, already measured to high precision by Juno. As the mission\ncontinues, improved coverage of Jupiter's gravity field at different phases of\nIo's orbit is expected to yield an observed value for the degree-2 Love number\n($k_{22}$) and potentially select higher--degree $k_{nm}$. We present a test of\nthe sensitivity of the Juno Doppler signal to the calculated $k_{nm}$, which\nsuggests the detectability of $k_{33}$, $k_{42}$ and $k_{31}$, in addition to\n$k_{22}$. A mismatch of a robust Juno observation with the remarkably small\nrange in calculated Io equilibrium $k_{22}=0.58976\\pm0.0001$, would indicate a\nheretofore uncharacterized dynamic contribution to the tides.",

Calibration observations\nbegan several months after the NH launch on 2006 January 19 and have been\nrepeated annually throughout the course of the mission, which is ongoing. This\npaper describes the in-flight LORRI calibration measurements, and the results\nderived from our analysis of the calibration data. LORRI has been remarkably\nstable over time with no detectable changes (at the 1% level) in sensitivity or\noptical performance since launch. By employing 4 by 4 re-binning of the CCD\npixels during read out, a special spacecraft tracking mode, exposure times of\n30 sec, and co-addition of approximately 100 images, LORRI can detect\nunresolved targets down to V = 22 (SNR=5). LORRI images have an instantaneous\ndynamic range of 3500, which combined with exposure time control ranging from\n0ms to 64,967 ms in 1ms steps supports high resolution, high sensitivity\nimaging of planetary targets spanning heliocentric distances from Jupiter to\ndeep in the Kuiper belt, enabling a wide variety of scientific investigations.\nWe describe here how to transform LORRI images from raw (engineering) units\ninto scientific (calibrated) units for both resolved and unresolved targets. We\nalso describe various instrumental artifacts that could affect the\ninterpretation of LORRI images under some observing circumstances.",

Here, we have analyzed 30\ntype III bursts detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). For the first time, we\nhave retrieved type III burst decay times $\\tau_{\\rm{d}}$ between 1 MHz and 10\nMHz thanks to an unparalleled temporal resolution of PSP. We observed a\nsignificant deviation in a power-law slope for frequencies above 1 MHz when\ncompared to previous measurements below 1 MHz by the twin-spacecraft Solar\nTErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. We note that altitudes of\nradio bursts generated at 1 MHz roughly coincide with an expected location of\nthe Alfv\u00e9n point, where the solar wind becomes super-Alfv\u00e9nic. By\ncomparing PSP observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict relative\ndensity fluctuations $\\epsilon$ at the effective turbulence scale length at\nradial distances between 2.5$R_\\odot$ and 14$R_\\odot$ to range from $0.22$ and\n$0.09$.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic reconnection (MR) and the associated concurrently occurring waves\nhave been extensively studied at large-scale plasma boundaries, in\nquasi-symmetric and asymmetric configurations in the terrestrial magnetotail\nand at the magnetopause. Recent high-resolution observations by MMS\n(Magnetospheric Multiscale) spacecraft indicate that MR can occur also in the\nmagnetosheath where the conditions are highly turbulent when the upstream shock\ngeometry is quasi-parallel. The strong turbulent motions make the boundary\nconditions for evolving MR complicated. In this paper it is demonstrated that\nthe wave observations in localized regions of MR can serve as an additional\ndiagnostic tool reinforcing our capacity for identifying MR events in turbulent\nplasmas. It is shown that in a close resemblance with MR at large-scale\nboundaries, turbulent reconnection associated whistler waves occur at\nseparatrix/outflow regions and at the outer boundary of the electron diffusion\nregion, while lower hybrid drift waves are associated with density gradients\nduring the crossing of the current sheet. The lower hybrid drift instability\ncan make the density inhomogeneities rippled. The identification of MR\nassociated waves in the magnetosheath represents also an important milestone\nfor developing a better understanding of energy redistribution and dissipation\nin turbulent plasmas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The physical mechanisms that produce the slow solar wind are still highly\ndebated. Parker Solar Probe's (PSP's) second solar encounter provided a new\nopportunity to relate in situ measurements of the nascent slow solar wind with\nwhite-light images of streamer flows. We exploit data taken by the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory\n(STEREO) and the Wide Imager on Solar Probe to reveal for the first time a\nclose link between imaged streamer flows and the high-density plasma measured\nby the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) experiment. We identify\ndifferent types of slow winds measured by PSP that we relate to the\nspacecraft's magnetic connectivity (or not) to streamer flows. SWEAP measured\nhigh-density and highly variable plasma when PSP was well connected to\nstreamers but more tenuous wind with much weaker density variations when it\nexited streamer flows. STEREO imaging of the release and propagation of small\ntransients from the Sun to PSP reveals that the spacecraft was continually\nimpacted by the southern edge of streamer transients. The impact of specific\ndensity structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic field reversals\nmeasured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the\nstreamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals\noriginating outside streamers. We tentatively interpret these findings in terms\nof magnetic reconnection between open magnetic fields and coronal loops with\ndifferent properties, providing support for the formation of a subset of the\nslow wind by magnetic reconnection.",

Among the pool of chemical compounds formed by the\nphotolysis, N-bearing species are involved in the haze formation but the\nchemical incorporation pathways need to be better constrained.}\\\\ In this work,\nwe performed low-pressure EUV photochemical laboratory experiments. The APSIS\nreactor was filled with a N$_2$/CH$_4$ (90/10\\%) gas mixture relevant to the\nupper atmosphere of Titan. The cell was irradiated by using a EUV photon source\nat 73.6 nm {which has been difficult to produce in the laboratory for previous\nstudies.}. The photoproducts (both neutral and ionic species) were monitored\n\\textit{in situ} with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The chemical pathways are\nexplained by confronting experimental observations and numerical predictions of\nthe photoproducts. \\\\ The most interesting result in this work is that\nmethanimine was the only stable N-bearing neutral molecule detected during the\nexperiments and it relies on N$_2^+$ production. This experimental result is in\nagreement with the relatively high abundance predicted by 1D-photochemical\nmodels of Titan's atmosphere and comforts methanimine as an intermediate\ntowards the formation of complex N-bearing organic molecules.\\\\ {This\nexperiment is only testing one part of the overall chemical scheme for Titan's\nupper atmosphere due to the selective wavelength but demonstrates the\ncapability to probe the chemical pathways occurring in Titan's atmosphere by\nminimizing bias coming from wall surface reactions.}",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Martian bow shocks, the solar wind interacting with an unmagnetized planet,\nare studied. We theoretically investigated how solar parameters, such as the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure and the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux,\ninfluence the bow shock location, which is still currently not well understood.\nWe present the formula for the location of the bow shock nose of the\nunmagnetized planet. The bow shock location, the sum of the ionopause location\nand bow shock standoff distance, is calculated in the gasdynamics approach. The\nionopause location is determined using thermal pressure continuity, i.e., the\nsolar wind thermal pressure equal to the ionospheric pressure, according to\ntangential discontinuity. The analytical formula of the ionopause nose location\nand the ionopause profile around the nose are obtained. The standoff distance\nis calculated using the empirical model. Our derived formula shows that the\nshock nose location is a function of the scale height of ionosphere, the\ndynamic pressure of the solar wind and the peak ionospheric pressure. The\ntheoretical model implies that the shock nose location is more sensitive to the\nsolar EUV flux than solar wind dynamics pressure. Further, we theoretically\nshow that the bow shock location is proportional to the solar wind dynamic\npressure to the power of negative C, where C is about the ratio of the\nionospheric scale height to the distance between bow shock nose and the planet\ncenter. This theory matches the gasdynamics simulation and is consistent with\nthe spacecraft measurement result by Mars Express [Hall, et al. (2016) J.\nGeophys. Res. Space Physics, 121, 11,474-11,494].",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present the results from four stellar occultations by (486958) Arrokoth,\nthe flyby target of the New Horizons extended mission. Three of the four\nefforts led to positive detections of the body, and all constrained the\npresence of rings and other debris, finding none. Twenty-five mobile stations\nwere deployed for 2017 June 3 and augmented by fixed telescopes. There were no\npositive detections from this effort. The event on 2017 July 10 was observed by\nSOFIA with one very short chord. Twenty-four deployed stations on 2017 July 17\nresulted in five chords that clearly showed a complicated shape consistent with\na contact binary with rough dimensions of 20 by 30 km for the overall outline.\nA visible albedo of 10% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were\ndeployed for the fourth event on 2018 Aug 4 and resulted in two chords. The\ncombination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a\nsignificant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380\n$\\pm$ 0.0005 hours. The occultation data also provided high-precision\nastrometric constraints on the position of the object that were crucial for\nsupporting the navigation for the New Horizons flyby. This work demonstrates an\neffective method for obtaining detailed size and shape information and probing\nfor rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important\nsource of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is\nparticularly useful for small and distant bodies.",

In this work, we present a comprehensive catalog of 47 CMEs\nmeasured in situ measurements by two or more radially aligned spacecraft\n(MESSENGER, Venus Express, STEREO or Wind/ACE). We estimate the CME impact\nspeeds at Mercury and Venus using a drag-based model and present an average\npropagation profile of CMEs (speed and deceleration/acceleration) in the inner\nheliosphere. We find that CME deceleration continues past Mercury's orbit but\nmost of the deceleration occurs between the Sun and Mercury. We examine the\nexponential decrease of the maximum magnetic field strength in the CME with\nheliocentric distance using two approaches: a modified statistical method and\nanalysis from individual conjunction events. Findings from both the approaches\nare on average consistent with previous studies but show significant\nevent-to-event variability. We also find the expansion of the CME sheath to be\nwell fit by a linear function. However, we observe the average sheath duration\nand its increase to be fairly independent of the initial CME speed,\ncontradicting commonly held knowledge that slower CMEs drive larger sheaths. We\nalso present an analysis of the 3 November 2011 CME observed in longitudinal\nconjunction between MESSENGER, Venus Express, and STEREO-B focusing on the\nexpansion of the CME and its correlation with the exponential fall-off of the\nmaximum magnetic field strength in the ejecta.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  When creating asteroid regolith simulant, it is necessary to have a model of\nasteroid regolith to guide and to evaluate the simulant. We created a model\nthrough evaluation and synthesis of the available data sets including (1) the\nreturned sample from Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft, (2) imagery from the\nHayabusa and NEAR spacecraft visiting Itokawa and Eros, respectively, (3)\nthermal infrared observations from asteroids, (4) the texture of meteorite\nregolith breccias, and (5) observations and modeling of the ejecta clouds from\ndisrupted asteroids. Comparison of the Hayabusa returned sample with other data\nsets suggest the surficial material in the smooth regions of asteroids is\ndissimilar to the bulk regolith, probably due to removal of fines by\nphotoionization and solar wind interaction or by preferential migration of\nmid-sized particles into the smooth terrain. We found deep challenges\ninterpreting and applying the thermal infrared data so we were unable to use\nthose observations in the model. Texture of regolith breccias do not agree with\nother data sets, suggesting the source regolith on Vesta was coarser than\ntypical asteroid regolith. The observations of disrupted asteroids present a\ncoherent picture of asteroid bulk regolith in collisional equilibrium, unlike\nlunar regolith, HED textures, and the Itokawa returned sample. The model we\nadopt consists of power laws for the bulk regolith in unspecified terrain\n(differential power index -3.5, representing equilibrium), and the surficial\nregolith in smooth terrain (differential power index -2.5, representing\ndisequilibrium). Available data do not provide adequate constraints on maximum\nand minimum particle sizes for these power laws, so the model treats them as\nuser-selectable parameters for the simulant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The DART spacecraft is planned to impact the secondary of the binary asteroid\n(65803) Didymos in 2022, to assess deflection strategies for planetary defense.\nThe impact will create a crater and release asteroidal material, some of which\nwill escape the Didymos system. Because the closest point of approach of\nDidymos to Earth's orbit is only 6 million km (about 16 times the Earth-Moon\ndistance), some ejected material will make its way sooner or later to our\nplanet, and the observation of these particles as meteors would increase the\nscientific payout of the DART mission. The DART project may also represent the\nfirst human-generated meteoroids to reach Earth, and a test case for human\nactivity on asteroids and its eventual contribution to the meteoroid\nenvironment and spacecraft impact risk. This study examines the amount and\ntiming of the delivery of meteoroids from Didymos to near-Earth space. Very\nlittle DART-ejected material will reach our planet, and most only after\nthousands of years. But some material, the smallest particles and/or those\nejected at the highest velocities could be delivered to Earth-crossing\ntrajectories almost immediately, though at very low fluxes. Timing and radiant\ndirections for material reaching the Earth are calculated, though the detection\nof substantial numbers would indicate more abundant and/or faster ejecta than\nis expected. The DART impact will also create a new meteoroid stream, though\nprobably not a very dense one. However, larger, more capable asteroid impactors\ncould create meteoroid streams in which the particle flux exceeds that\nnaturally occurring in the Solar System, with implications for spacecraft\nsafety.",

To\nanalyze and interpret WISPR observations, which evolve rapidly both radially\nand longitudinally, we construct a latitude versus time map using the full\nWISPR dataset from the first encounter. From the exploitation of this map and\nalso from sequential WISPR images, we show the presence of multiple\nsubstructures inside streamers and pseudostreamers. WISPR unveils the\nfine-scale structure of the densest part of streamer rays that we identify as\nthe solar origin of the heliospheric plasma sheet typically measured in situ in\nthe solar wind. We exploit 3D magnetohydrodynamic models, and we construct\nsynthetic white-light images to study the origin of the coronal structures\nobserved by WISPR. Overall, including the effect of the spacecraft relative\nmotion toward the individual coronal structures, we can interpret several\nobserved features by WISPR. Moreover, we relate some coronal rays to folds in\nthe heliospheric current sheet that are unresolved from 1 au.

The vast majority of\nthese events was caused by plasma turbulence. Defining dust events as those\nhaving similar, narrowly peaked, positive, single-ended signatures, resulted in\nfinding 135 clear dust events, which, after correcting for the low detection\nefficiently, resulted in an estimate consistent with the 1000 dust events\nexpected from other techniques. Defining time domain structures (TDS) as those\nhaving opposite polarity signals in the opposite antennas resulted in finding\n238 clear TDS events which, after correcting for the detection efficiency,\nresulted in an estimated 500-1000 TDS events on this day. The TDS electric\nfields were bipolar, as expected for electron holes. Several events were found\nat times when the magnetic field was in the plane of the two measured\ncomponents of the electric field such that the component of the electric field\nparallel to the magnetic field was measured. One example of significant\nparallel electric fields shows the negative potential that classified them as\nelectron holes. Because the TDS observation rate was not uniform with time, it\nis likely that there were local regions below the spacecraft with field-aligned\ncurrents that generated the TDS.",

The variations of the visible\nchannel temperatures measured during the sessions of acquisitions are\ncorrelated with variations in the spectral slope and shape for all the mission\nphases. The infrared channel (IR) temperature is more stable during the\nacquisitions, nonetheless it is characterized by a bi-modal distribution\nwhether the cryocooler (and therefore the IR channel) is used or not during the\nvisible channel operations. When the infrared channel temperature is high\n(175K, i.e. not in use and with crycooler off), an additional negative slope\nand a distortion are observed in the spectra of the visible channel. We\ndeveloped an empirical correction based on a reference spectrum for the whole\ndata set; it is designed to correct the two issues related to the sensor\ntemperatures that we have identified. The reference spectrum is calculated to\nbe representative of the global Ceres' surface. It is also made of data\nacquired when the visible and infrared channel temperatures are equal to the\nones measured during an observation of the Arcturus star by VIR, which is\nconsistent with several ground-based observations. The developed correction\nallows reliable analysis and mapping to be performed by minimizing the\nartifacts induced by fluctuations of the VIS temperature.

The shocks originate\nin solar eruptions involving coronal mass ejections (CMEs) moving at\nsuper-Alfvenic speeds. Type II bursts occur at frequencies ranging from\nhundreds of MHz to tens of kHz, which correspond to plasma frequencies\nprevailing in the inner heliosphere from the base of the solar corona to the\nvicinity of Earth. Type II radio bursts occurring at frequencies below the\nionospheric cutoff are of particular importance, because they are due to very\nenergetic CMEs that can disturb a large volume of the heliosphere. The\nunderlying shocks accelerate not only electrons that produce the type II\nbursts, but also protons and heavy ions that have serious implications for\nspace weather. The type II radio burst catalog\n(this https URL) presented here\nprovides detailed information on the bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma\nWave Experiment (WAVES) on board the Wind Spacecraft. The catalog is enhanced\nby compiling the associated flares, CMEs, solar energetic particle (SEP) events\nincluding their basic properties. We also present the statistical properties of\nthe radio bursts and the associated phenomena, including solar-cycle variation\nof the occurrence rate of the type II bursts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun are the largest explosions\nin the Solar System that can drive powerful plasma shocks. The eruptions,\nshocks, and other processes associated to CMEs are efficient particle\naccelerators and the accelerated electrons in particular can produce radio\nbursts through the plasma emission mechanism. Aims. Coronal mass ejections and\nassociated radio bursts have been well studied in cases where the CME\noriginates close to the solar limb or within the frontside disc. Here, we study\nthe radio emission associated with a CME eruption on the back side of the Sun\non 22 July 2012. Methods. Using radio imaging from the Nan\u00e7ay\nRadioheliograph, spectroscopic data from the Nan\u00e7ay Decametric Array, and\nextreme-ultraviolet observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, we determine the nature of the\nobserved radio emission as well as the location and propagation of the CME.\nResults. We show that the observed low-intensity radio emission corresponds to\na type II radio burst or a short-duration type IV radio burst associated with a\nCME eruption due to breakout reconnection on the back side of the Sun, as\nsuggested by the pre-eruptive magnetic field configuration. The radio emission\nconsists of a large, extended structure, initially located ahead of the CME,\nthat corresponds to various electron acceleration locations. Conclusions. The\nobservations presented here are consistent with the breakout model of CME\neruptions. The extended radio emission coincides with the location of the\ncurrent sheet and quasi-separatrix boundary of the CME flux and the overlying\nhelmet streamer and also with that of a large shock expected to form ahead of\nthe CME in this configuration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The possibility of compensating atmospheric influence in an experiment on\nprecision measurement of gravitational redshift using the \"RadioAstron\"\nspacecraft (SC) is discussed. When a signal propagates from a ground-based\ntracking station to a spacecraft and back, interaction with the ionosphere and\ntroposphere makes considerable contribution to the frequency shift. A brief\noverview of the physical effects determining this contribution is given, and\nthe principles of calculation and compensation of the corresponding frequency\ndistortions of radio signals are described. Then these approaches are used to\nreduce the atmospheric frequency shift of the \"RadioAstron\" spacecraft signal.\nThe spacecraft hardware allows working in two communication modes: \"one-way\"\nand \"two-way\", in addition, two communication channels at different frequencies\nwork simultaneously. \"One-way\" (SC - ground-based tracking station)\ncommunication mode, a signal is synchronized by the on board hydrogen frequency\nstandard. The \"two-way\" (SC - ground-based tracking station - SC ) mode is\nsynchronized by the ground hydrogen standard. The calculations performed allow\nus to compare the quality of compensation of atmospheric fluctuations performed\nby various methods and choose the optimal one.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The occurrence of planets orbiting ultracool dwarfs is poorly constrained. We\npresent results from a Guest Observer program on NASA's K2 spacecraft to search\nfor transiting planets orbiting a sample of 827 ultracool dwarfs. Having found\nno transiting planets in our sample, we determined an upper limit on the\noccurrence of planets. We simulated planets orbiting our sample for a range of\norbital periods and sizes. For the simulated planets that transit their host,\nwe injected the transit light curve into the real K2 light curves, then\nattempted to recover the injected planets. For a given occurrence rate, we\ncalculated the probability of seeing no planets, and use the results to place\nan upper limit on planet occurrence as a function of planet radius and orbital\nperiod. We find that short period, mini-Neptune- and Jupiter-sized planets are\nrare around ultracool dwarfs, consistent with results for early- and mid-type M\ndwarf stars. We constrain the occurrence rate $\\eta$ for planets between $0.5$\nand $10$ R$_{\\oplus}$ with orbital periods between 1 and 26.3 days.",
