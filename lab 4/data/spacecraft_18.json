    "abstract": "Abstract:  Planetary radars have obtained unique science measurements about solar system\nbodies and they have provided orbit determinations allowing spacecraft to be\nnavigated throughout the solar system. Notable results have been on Venus,\nEarth's \"twin,\" and small bodies, which are the constituents of the Sun's\ndebris disk. Together, these results have served as \"ground truth\" from the\nsolar system for studies of extrasolar planets. The Nation's planetary radar\ninfrastructure, indeed the world's planetary radar infrastructure, is based on\nastronomical and deep space telecommunications infrastructure, namely the radar\ntransmitters at the Arecibo Observatory and the Goldstone Solar System Radar,\npart of NASA's Deep Space Network, along with the Green Bank Telescope as a\nreceiving element. This white paper summarizes the state of this infrastructure\nand potential technical developments that should be sustained in order to\nenable continued studies of solar system bodies for comparison and contrast\nwith extrasolar planetary systems. Because the planetary radar observations\nleverage existing infrastructure largely developed for other purposes, only\noperations and maintenance funding is required, though modest investments could\nyield more reliable systems; in the case of the Green Bank Telescope,\nadditional funding for operations is required.",

We need to understand how the Sun creates the heliosphere, and\nhow the planets interact with the solar wind and its magnetic field, not just\nas a matter of scientific curiosity, but to address a clear and pressing\npractical problem: space weather, which can influence the performance and\nreliability of our technological systems, in space and on the ground, and can\nendanger human life and health.\nMuch knowledge has already been acquired over the past decades, but the\ninfant stage of space weather forecasting demonstrates that we still have a\nvast amount of learning to do. We can tackle this issue in two ways: 1) By\nusing multiple spacecraft measuring conditions in situ in the magnetosphere in\norder to make sense of the fundamental small scale processes that enable\ntransport and coupling, or 2) By taking a global approach to observations of\nthe conditions that prevail throughout geospace in order to quantify the global\neffects of external drivers.\nA global approach is now being taken by a number of space missions under\ndevelopment and the first tantalising results of their exploration will be\navailable in the next decade. Here we propose the next step-up in the quest for\na complete understanding of how the Sun gives rise to and controls the Earth's\nplasma environment: a tomographic imaging approach comprising two spacecraft\nwhich enable global imaging of magnetopause and cusps, auroral regions,\nplasmasphere and ring current, alongside in situ measurements. Such a mission\nis going to be crucial on the way to achieve scientific closure on the question\nof solar-terrestrial interactions.",

For the scientific and\nprogrammatic reasons outlined in this document, Venus is a compelling target\nfor exploration. The science themes important for Venus research - comparative\nplanetology and planetary evolution - are common to all of planetary and\nexoplanetary science. Many of the payloads required - radar and atmospheric\nremote sensing, in situ mass spectrometers - are common to mission proposals\nfor many other solar system targets, as are mission technologies like high rate\ndeep-space telecommunications technologies. Venus-specific technology\ndevelopments meriting special attention include high-temperature systems and\nballoons. Venus is an excellent proving ground for fundamental understanding of\ngeophysical processes of terrestrial planets; an excellent proving ground for\ntechniques of analysis of exoplanets; an indispensable part of our quest to\nunderstand the evolution of Earthlike planets. For all these reasons, Venus\nwill be an ever more compelling theme in the coming decades, and we therefore\nrecommend its inclusion in the Voyage 2050 plan.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have become heavily reliant on electrical technologies, from power grids\nto GPS to wireless communication. Any disruption of these systems will have\nsevere global consequences. A major natural hazard for such electrical\ndisruption is caused by solar wind disturbances that have dramatic geospace\nimpact.Estimates are that a solar storm of the magnitude of the 1859 Carrington\nSolar Superstorm would cause over $2 trillion in damage today. In July 23,\n2012, we had a near miss of a solar Superstorm that could have broken the\nrecord of largest such storms at Earth. To enable pre-emptive measures,\ndeveloping accurate space weather forecasts is urgent. At the core of space\nweather forecasts is plasma physics, and kinetic turbulence, in particular. For\nexample, the intense turbulence stirred up at the bow shock and foreshock have\nbeen shown to open up pathways for high velocity solar wind parcels to bypass\nthe protective shield of the terrestrial magnetosphere and create disturbances\nin the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. A primary challenge in understanding\nkinetic turbulence and its global implications is its multi-scale nature,\nspanning from electron scales to macro scales of the magnetosphere. Current\nfour-spacecraft missions with 3D formations, the Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) and Cluster, have made progress in our understanding of such turbulence.\nYet the limitation of a fixed spacecraft formation size at a given time\nprohibits probing the multi-scale nature as well as the dynamical evolution of\nthe phenomena. A transformative leap in our understanding of turbulence is\nexpected with in-situ probes populating a 3D volume and forming multiple\n'n-hedrons (n > 4)' in MHD to kinetic scales.",

We use the K2 light curve (78.7 days)\nto extract 169 pulsation frequencies, 124 with a robust detection. Most of\nthese frequencies are found in the low-frequency region typical of gravity\n(g-)modes, but some higher frequencies corresponding to pressure (p-)modes are\nalso detected. Therefore HD4539 is a hybrid pulsator and both the deep and\nsurface layers of the star can potentially be probed through asteroseismology.\nThe lack of any frequency splitting in its amplitude spectrum suggests that\nHD4539 has a rotation period longer than the K2 run and/or that it is seen\npole-on. From asymptotic period spacing we see many high-degree modes, up to\nl=12, in the spectrum of HD4539, with amplitudes as low as a few ppm. A large\nfraction of these modes can be identified and for ~29% of them we obtain a\nunique and robust identification corresponding to l<=8. Our study includes also\na new determination of the atmospheric parameters of the star. From\nlow-resolution spectroscopy we obtain Teff=22,800+-160 K, logg=5.20+-0.02 and\nlog(N(He)/N(H))=-2.34+-0.05. By fitting the SED we obtain Teff=23,470+650-210\nK, R_star=0.26+-0.01 Rsun and M_star=0.40+-0.08 Msun. Moreover, from 11\nhigh-resolution spectra we see the radial velocity variations caused by the\nstellar pulsations, with amplitudes of ~150~m/s for the main modes, and we can\nexclude the presence of a companion with a minimum mass higher than a few\nJupiter masses for orbital periods below ~300 days.",

Accounting for Euclid's\npointing constraints, it could therefore potentially measure ~ 20 free-floating\nplanet parallaxes with 120 days of observations split equally between Euclid's\nmain mission and an extended mission, with a potential to increase this number\nif spacecraft pointing constraints can be relaxed after the end of the main\nmission.

Propagation angle\nand compressibility are used to test the nature of turbulent fluctuations. The\nmagnetic field spectra have the spectral slopes between -1.5 to 0 down to\nspatial scales of 20 ion gyroradius and show clear evidence of a transition to\nsteeper spectra for small scales with a second power-law, having slopes between\n-2.6 to -1.8.

On the other hand at f_sc>10f_ci, the propagation angle exhibits a broad\nrange between 30-90 degree while 'R' has a small variation: 0.2 < R > 0.5. We\nconjecture that at high frequencies, the perpendicularly propagating Alfven\nwaves could partly explain the statistical analysis of spectra.

The most\nrecent of these events, which began in June 2018, was monitored by several\nspacecraft in orbit and on the surface, but many questions remain regarding its\nonset, expansion and decay. We model the 2018 global dust storm with the NASA\nAmes Mars Global Climate Model to better understand the evolution of the storm\nand how the general circulation and finite surface dust reservoirs impact it.\nThe global dust storm is characterized by the rapid eastward transport of dust\nin the equatorial regions and subsequent lifting. We highlight the rapid\ntransfer of dust between western and eastern hemispheres reservoirs, which may\nplay an important role in the storm development through the replenishment of\nsurface dust. Both the Hadley cell circulation and the diurnal cycle of\natmospheric heating increase in intensity with increasing dustiness. Large dust\nplumes are predicted during the mature stage of the storm, injecting dust up to\n80 km. The water ice cloud condensation level migrates to higher altitudes,\nleading to the enrichment of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. In our\nsimulations, the intensity of the Hadley cell is significantly stronger than\nthat of non-dusty conditions. This feedback is strongly sensitive to the\nradiative properties of dust, which depends on the effective size of the lifted\ndust distribution.",

The in-situ\nexploration of the uninviting environment of Jupiter's radiation belts present\nus with many challenges in mission design, science planning, instrumentation\nand technology development. We address these challenges by reviewing the\ndifferent options that exist for direct and indirect observation of this unique\nsystem. We stress the need for new instruments, the value of synergistic Earth\nand Jupiter-based remote sensing and in-situ investigations, and the vital\nimportance of multi-spacecraft, in-situ measurements. While simultaneous,\nmulti-point in-situ observations have long become the standard for exploring\nelectromagnetic interactions in the inner solar system, they have never taken\nplace at Jupiter or any strongly magnetized planet besides Earth. We conclude\nthat a dedicated multi-spacecraft mission to Jupiter's radiation belts is an\nessential and obvious way forward and deserves to be given a high priority in\nESA's Voyage 2050 programme.",

However, this 2-D isotropic feature is obtained based\non the assumption of axisymmetry with respect to the mean magnetic field.\nWhether the self-correlation level contours are still 3-D isotropic remains\nunknown. Here we perform for the first time a 3-D self-correlation level\ncontours analysis on the solar wind turbulence. We construct a 3-D coordinate\nsystem based on the mean magnetic field direction and the maximum fluctuation\ndirection identified by the minimum-variance analysis (MVA) method. We use data\nwith 1-hour intervals observed by WIND spacecraft from 2005 to 2018. We find,\non one hand, in the slow solar wind, the self-correlation level contour\nsurfaces for both the magnetic field and the velocity field are almost\nspherical, which indicates a 3-D isotropic feature. On the other hand, there is\na weak elongation in one of the perpendicular direction in the fast solar wind\nfluctuations. The 3-D feature of the self-correlation level contours surfaces\ncannot be explained by the existed theory.",

We present\nthe first-of-their-kind observations of the energetic particle acceleration in\na Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) using data from two vantage points, 1 au\n(near Earth) and 1.5 au (near Mars). The CIR event of June 2015 was observed by\nthe particle detectors aboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite\nas well as the SEP (Solar Energetic Particle) instrument aboard the Mars\nAtmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft situated near 1.5 au. We\nfind that a CIR shock can accelerate a significant number of particles even at\n1.5 au. During this event the acceleration by the shocks associated with the\nCIR could cause an enhancement of around two orders of magnitude in the SEP\nenergetic ion fluxes in the ~500 keV to 2 MeV range when the observations near\n1 and 1.5 au are compared. To demonstrate the differences between SEP\nacceleration in CIR and other impulsive events, we show the energetic ion flux\nobservations during an intense CME period in March 2015, in which case the\nenhanced SEP fluxes are seen even at 1 au. These observations provide evidence\nthat CIR shock can accelerate particles in the region between Earth and Mars,\nthat is, only within the short heliocentric distance of 0.5 au, in\ninterplanetary space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Comets hold the key to the understanding of our solar system, its formation\nand its evolution, and to the fundamental plasma processes at work both in it\nand beyond it. A comet nucleus emits gas as it is heated by the sunlight. The\ngas forms the coma, where it is ionised, becomes a plasma and eventually\ninteracts with the solar wind. Besides these neutral and ionised gases, the\ncoma also contains dust grains, released from the comet nucleus. As a cometary\natmosphere develops when the comet travels through the solar system,\nlarge-scale structures, such as the plasma boundaries, develop and disappear,\nwhile at planets such large-scale structures are only accessible in their fully\ngrown, quasi-steady state. In situ measurements at comets enable us to learn\nboth how such large-scale structures are formed or reformed and how small-scale\nprocesses in the plasma affect the formation and properties of these large\nscale structures. Furthermore, a comet goes through a wide range of parameter\nregimes during its life cycle, where either collisional processes, involving\nneutrals and charged particles, or collisionless processes are at play, and\nmight even compete in complicated transitional regimes. Thus a comet presents a\nunique opportunity to study this parameter space, from an asteroid-like to a\nMars- and Venus-like interaction. Fast flybys of comets have made many new\ndiscoveries, setting the stage for a multi-spacecraft mission to accompany a\ncomet on its journey through the solar system. This white paper reviews the\npresent-day knowledge of cometary plasmas, discusses the many questions that\nremain unanswered, and outlines a multi-spacecraft ESA mission to accompany a\ncomet that will answer these questions by combining both multi-spacecraft\nobservations and a rendezvous mission, and at the same time advance our\nunderstanding of fundamental plasma physics and its role in planetary systems.",

This braking torque is coupled to the stellar magnetic field, such that\nchanges in the strength and/or geometry of the field modifies the efficiency of\nthis process.

Furthermore, indirect proxies such as\nsunspot number, geomagnetic indices, and cosmogenic radionuclides, constrain\nthe variation of solar wind properties on centennial, and millennial\ntimescales. We use near-Earth measurements of the solar wind plasma and\nmagnetic field to calculate the torque on the Sun throughout the space-age.\nThen, reconstructions of the solar open magnetic flux are used to estimate the\ntime-varying braking torque during the last nine millennia. We assume a\nrelationship for the solar mass loss rate based on observations during the\nspace-age which, due to the weak dependence of the torque on mass loss rate,\ndoes not strongly affect our predicted torque. The average torque during the\nlast nine millennia is found to be $2.2\\times10^{30}$erg, which is comparable\nto the average value from the last two decades. Our dataset includes grand\nminima (such as the Maunder Minimum), and maxima in solar activity, where the\ntorque varies from $\\sim1-5\\times10^{30}$erg (averaged on decadal timescales),\nrespectively.

Currently, a nuclear\ndevice is the only means of deflecting large Potentially Hazardous Asteroids\n(PHAs) away from an Earth-impacting trajectory. The Enhanced Kinetic Impactor\n(EKI) concept is proposed to deflect large PHAs via maneuvering space rocks.\nFirst, an unmanned spacecraft is launched to rendezvous with an intermediate\nNear-Earth Asteroid (NEA). Then, more than one hundred tons of rocks are\ncollected from the NEA as the EKI. The NEA can also be captured as the EKI if\nthe NEA is very small. Finally, the EKI is maneuvered to impact the PHA at a\nhigh speed, resulting in a significant deflection of the PHA. For example, to\ndeflect Apophis, as much as 200 t of rocks could be collected from a NEA as the\nEKI based on existing engineering capabilities. The EKI can produce a velocity\nincrement (delta-v) of 39.81 mm/s in Apophis, thereby increasing the minimum\ngeocentric distance during the close encounter in 2029 by 1,866.93 km. This\nmission can be completed in 3.96 years with a propellant cost of 2.98 t.\nCompared with a classic kinetic impactor, the deflection distance can be\nincreased one order of magnitude. The EKI concept breaks through the limitation\nof the ground-based launch capability, which can significantly increase the\nmass of the impactor. We anticipate that our research will be a starting point\nfor efficient planetary defense against large PHAs.",

The basis are\nmeasurements obtained with the ROSINA instrument suite on board the Rosetta\norbiter during a suitable period of high outgassing near perihelion. The\nresults are combined with both gas and dust composition measurements published\nin the literature. This provides an integrated inventory of the major elements\npresent in the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Similar to comet\n1P/Halley, which was visited by ESA's Giotto spacecraft in 1986, comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko also shows near-solar abundances of oxygen and\ncarbon, whereas hydrogen and nitrogen are depleted compared to solar. Still,\nthe degree of devolatilization is lower than that of inner solar system\nobjects, including meteorites and the Earth.

Confirmation\nof these planet candidates with follow-up studies will increase the number of\nK2 planets by up to 50%, and characterization of their host stars will improve\nstatistical studies of planet properties. Our sample includes many planets\norbiting bright stars amenable for radial velocity follow-up and future\ncharacterization with JWST.

We demonstrate that under equivalent conditions,\nwhere in a viscous disc convergent migration will form a long-term stable\nsystem of planets in a chain of mean motion resonances, migration in an\ninviscid disc often produces a system which is highly dynamically unstable. In\nparticular, if planets are massive enough to significantly perturb the disc\nsurface density and drive vortex formation, the smooth capture of planets into\nmean motion resonances is disrupted. As planets pile up in close orbits, not\nprotected by resonances, close encounters increase the probability of\nplanet-planet collisions, even while the gas disc is still present. While\ninviscid discs often produce unstable non-resonant systems, stable, closely\npacked, non-resonant systems can also be formed. Thus, when examining the\nexpectation for planet migration to produce planetary systems in mean motion\nresonances, the effective turbulent viscosity of the protoplanetary disc is a\nkey parameter.",

In this work, we reconstruct four\ngridded CDOD maps per sol, at different Mars Universal Times.

In order to understand whether the daily variability of CDOD has a\nphysical explanation, we have carried out numerical simulations with the\n\"Laboratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique\" Mars Global Climate Model. Using a\n\"free dust\" run initiated at $L_s \\sim 210^\\circ$ with the corresponding kriged\nmap, but subsequently free of further CDOD forcing, we show that the model is\nable to account for some of the observed daily variability in CDOD.

Prominent explanations for the\ninflation involve enhanced magnetic fields generated by rapid rotation of the\nstar that inhibit convection and/or suppress flux from the star via starspots.\nHowever, derived masses and radii for individual eclipsing binary systems often\ndisagree in the literature. In this paper, we continue to investigate low-mass\neclipsing binaries (EBs) observed by NASA's {\\it Kepler} spacecraft, deriving\nstellar masses and radii using high-quality space-based light curves and radial\nvelocities from high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We report masses and\nradii for three {\\it Kepler} EBs, two of which agree with previously published\nmasses and radii (KIC 11922782 and KIC 9821078). For the third EB (KIC\n7605600), we report new masses and show the secondary component is likely fully\nconvective ($M_2 = 0.17 \\pm 0.01 M_{\\sun}$ and $R_2 = 0.199^{+0.001}_{-0.002}\nR_{\\sun}$). Combined with KIC 10935310 from Han et al.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Galaxy is conventionally thought to be surrounded by a massive dark\nmatter (DM) halo. As the Sun goes through this halo, it excites a DM wake\nbehind it. This local asymmetry in the DM distribution would gravitationally\naffect the motions of Solar System planets, potentially allowing the DM wake to\nbe detected or ruled out. Hernandez (2019) recently calculated that the\nDM-induced perturbation to Saturn's position is 252 metres net of the effect on\nthe Sun. No such anomaly is seen in Saturn's motion despite very accurate\ntracking of the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn for >13 years. Here,\nwe revisit the calculation of how much Saturn would deviate from Keplerian\nmotion if we fix its position and velocity at some particular time. The DM wake\ninduces a nearly resonant perturbation whose amplitude grows almost linearly\nwith time. We show that the Hernandez (2019) result applies only for an\nobserving duration comparable to the ${\\approx 250}$ million year period of the\nSun's orbit around the Galaxy. Over a 100 year period, the perturbation to\nSaturn's orbit amounts to <1 cm, which is quite consistent with existing\nobservations. Even smaller perturbations are expected for the terrestrial\nplanets.",

This creates a delay of several months\nbetween the spacecraft's arrival and the ability to safely complete close\nproximity maneuvers. In this work we develop an adaptive integrated guidance,\nnavigation, and control system that can complete these maneuvers in\nenvironments with unknown dynamics, with initial conditions spanning a large\ndeployment region, and without a shape model of the asteroid. The system is\nimplemented as a policy optimized using reinforcement meta-learning. The\nspacecraft is equipped with an optical seeker that locks to either a terrain\nfeature, back-scattered light from a targeting laser, or an active beacon, and\nthe policy maps observations consisting of seeker angles and LIDAR range\nreadings directly to engine thrust commands. The policy implements a recurrent\nnetwork layer that allows the deployed policy to adapt real time to both\nenvironmental forces acting on the agent and internal disturbances such as\nactuator failure and center of mass variation. We validate the guidance system\nthrough simulated landing maneuvers in a six degrees-of-freedom simulator. The\nsimulator randomizes the asteroid's characteristics such as solar radiation\npressure, density, spin rate, and nutation angle, requiring the guidance and\ncontrol system to adapt to the environment. We also demonstrate robustness to\nactuator failure, sensor bias, and changes in the spacecraft's center of mass\nand inertia tensor. Finally, we suggest a concept of operations for asteroid\nclose proximity maneuvers that is compatible with the guidance system.",

A weakness of\nGaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However, much of the\nGalactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain studies, are\nobscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult for Gaia to\ndeeply probe. This problem can be overcome by switching to the Near Infra-Red\n(NIR) but this is not possible with silicon CCDs.

As such, it requires\nlow-complexity algorithms with good rate-distortion performance and high\nthroughput. In recent years, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\n(CCSDS) has focused on lossless and near-lossless compression approaches based\non predictive coding, resulting in the recently published CCSDS 123.0-B-2\nrecommended standard. While the in-loop reconstruction of quantized prediction\nresiduals provides excellent rate-distortion performance for the near-lossless\noperating mode, it significantly constrains the achievable throughput due to\ndata dependencies. In this paper, we study the performance of a faster method\nbased on prequantization of the image followed by a lossless predictive\ncompressor. While this is well known to be suboptimal, one can exploit powerful\nsignal models to reconstruct the image at the ground segment, recovering part\nof the suboptimality. In particular, we show that convolutional neural networks\ncan be used for this task and that they can recover the whole SNR drop incurred\nat a bitrate of 2 bits per pixel.",

We verify the\nphotometric quality of the UVOT settling data using bright stars in the field\nof view.

Of a sample of 23 afterglows which have peak V\nmagnitudes <16, we find that all are detected in the settling exposures, when\nSwift arrives on target. For 9 of the GRBs the UVOT settling exposure took\nplace before the conclusion of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Five of these\nGRBs have well defined optical peaks after the settling exposures, with rises\nof >0.5 mag in their optical lightcurves, and there is a marginal trend for\nthese GRBs to have long T90.

We employ\nstate-of-the-art data processing, velocity and electric field inversion methods\nfor deriving estimates of the energy and helicity injections from these\ndatasets. We find that the electric field inversion methods that reproduce the\nobserved magnetic field evolution through the use of Faraday's law are more\nstable against variable cadence: the PDFI (PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal) electric\nfield inversion method produces consistent injection estimates for cadences\nfrom 2.25 minutes up to 2 hours, implying that the photospheric processes\nacting on time scales below 2 hours contribute little to the injections, or\nthat they are below the sensitivity of the input data and the PDFI method. On\nother hand, the electric field estimate derived from the output of DAVE4VM\n(Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms), which does\nnot fulfil Faraday's law exactly, produces significant variations in the energy\nand helicity injection estimates in the 2.25-minute to 2-hour cadence range. We\npresent also a third, novel DAVE4VM-based electric field estimate, which\ncorrects the poor inductivity of the raw DAVE4VM estimate. This method is less\nsensitive to the changes of cadence, but still faces significant issues for the\nlowest of considered cadences ($\\geq$2 hours). We find several potential\nproblems in both PDFI- and DAVE4VM-based injection estimates and conclude that\nthe quality of both should be surveyed further in controlled environments.",

A spacecraft\ntravelling at $0.01 \\, c$ reaches this distance after 11.1 years. We show that\nthe extra gravity in MOND causes an anomalous deceleration that reduces its\nradial velocity by ${\\approx 3}$ cm/s and the two-way light travel time from\nthe inner Solar System by ${\\approx 0.1}$ seconds after 20 years. A distinctive\nsignature of MOND is that the gravity from the Sun is not directly towards it.\nThis is due to the non-linear nature of MOND and the external gravitational\nfield from the rest of the Galaxy, which we self-consistently include in our\ncalculations. As a result, the sky position of the spacecraft would deviate by\nup to 0.2 mas over 20 years. This deviation is always in the plane containing\nthe spacecraft trajectory and the direction towards the Galactic Centre. By\nlaunching spacecraft in different directions, it is possible to test the\ncharacteristic pattern of angular deviations expected in MOND. This would\nminimize the chance that any detected anomalies are caused by other processes\nlike drag from the interstellar medium. Such confounding factors could also be\nmitigated using an onboard accelerometer to measure non-gravitational forces.\nWe briefly discuss how the gravity theories could be conclusively distinguished\nusing a Cavendish-style active gravitational experiment beyond the Sun's MOND\nradius.",
