    "abstract": "Abstract:  Spacecraft observations of Saturn's rings show evidence of an active\naggregation-disaggregation process triggered by periodic influences from the\nnearby moons. This leads to clumping and break-up of the ring particles at\ntime-scales of the order of a few hours. A mathematical model has been\ndeveloped to explain these dynamics in the Saturn's F-ring and B-ring [3], the\nimplications of which are in close agreement with the empirical results. In\nthis paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis of the proposed forced dynamical\nsystem for a class of continuous, periodic and zero-mean forcing functions that\nmodel the ring perturbations caused by the moon flybys. In specific, we derive\nthe existence of at least one periodic solution to the dynamic system with the\nperiod equal to the forcing period of the moon. Further, conditions for the\nuniqueness and stability of the solution and bounds for the amplitudes of the\nperiodic solution are derived.",

The\nlight curves are dominated by incoherent variability on time scales of several\nhours, but contain a lower-amplitude periodicity of 1.23799 d. The temporal\namplitude and shape changes of this signal are best explicable with a\nrotational modulation, and are not consistent with a binary interpretation. We\nargue that we do not observe stellar pulsations within the limitations of our\ndata, and show that a binary central star with an orbital period less than\nseven days could only have escaped our detection in the case of low orbital\ninclination. Combining the photometric and spectroscopic evidence, we reason\nthat the hourly variations are due to a variable stellar wind, and are global\nin nature. The physical cause of the wind variability of NGC 6826 and other ZZ\nLeporis stars is likely related to the mechanism responsible for wind\nvariations in massive hot stars.",

Scientists seek understanding\nthe origin and evolution of our solar system by studying moons of these bodies.\nAdditionally, searches for satellites of planetary bodies can be important to\nprotect the safety of a spacecraft as it approaches or orbits a planetary body.\nIf a satellite of a celestial body is found, the mass of that body can also be\ncalculated once its orbit is determined. Ensuring the Dawn spacecraft's safety\non its mission to the asteroid (4) Vesta primarily motivated the work of Dawn's\nSatellite Working Group (SWG) in summer of 2011. Dawn mission scientists and\nengineers utilized various computational tools and techniques for Vesta's\nsatellite search. The objectives of this paper are to 1) introduce the natural\nsatellite search problem, 2) present the computational challenges, approaches,\nand tools used when addressing this problem, and 3) describe applications of\nvarious image processing and computational algorithms for performing satellite\nsearches to the electronic imaging and computer science community. Furthermore,\nwe hope that this communication would enable Dawn mission scientists to improve\ntheir satellite search algorithms and tools and be better prepared for\nperforming the same investigation in 2015, when the spacecraft is scheduled to\napproach and orbit the dwarf planet (1) Ceres.",

Furthermore, the acceleration led to electrons at relativistic energies\n(~MeV), comparable to the highest energies ever attributed to\nshock-acceleration in the solar wind.

This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such\nas eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to\nthem, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform\nnumerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false\npositives detectable by the Mission, and quantify the fraction of them that\nwould pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their\ndistribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest detected during the\nfirst six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive\nrate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet\nsize, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler\nis 9.4 %, peaking for giant planets (6-22 Earth radii) at 17.7 %, reaching a\nlow of 6.7 % for small Neptunes (2-4 Earth radii), and increasing again for\nEarth-size planets (0.8-1.25 Earth radii) to 12.3 %.\nMost importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate\nof occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their\nfrequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our\nsimulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5 +/-\n3.6 % of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25\nEarth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. There is no significant\ndependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with\nspectral type. In the process, we derive also a prescription for the signal\nrecovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and\norbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.",

Our most\nimportant result is the detection of an isotropic component of foreground\nradiation due to interstellar dust.\nThe dust in the inner solar system is known to have a fan-like distribution.\nIf this is assumed to extend to the orbit of Mars, we find that cometary,\nasteroidal and interstellar dust account for 70%, 22% and 7.5% of the dust in\nthe fan.

Our model is broadly consistent with the analysis by Divine (1993) of\ninterplanetary dust detected by Ulysses and other spacecraft. Our estimate of\nthe mass-density of interstellar dust in the inner solar system is consistent\nwith estimates from Ulysses at 1.5 au, but is an order of magnitude higher than\nUlysses estimates at r > 4 au. Only 1% of the zodiacal dust arriving at the\nearth would be interstellar, in our model.\nOur models can be further tested by ground-based kinematical studies of the\nzodiacal cloud, which need to extend over a period of years to monitor solar\ncycle variations in interstellar dust, by dynamical simulations, and by in situ\nmeasurements from spacecraft.",

At a point close to strong energy\ninput in space and time, the flare ions Fe XXII, Fe XXIII, and Fe XXIV reveal\nan isothermal source with a temperature close to 14 MK and no strong\nblueshifted components. At this location there is a strong downflow in cooler\nactive region lines from ions such as Fe XIII and Fe XIV.

Their orbits are significantly non-Keplerian because of the\nlarge secondary-to-primary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity of the binaries,\nas well as the proximity of the planets to the binaries. We present an analytic\ntheory, with the planet treated as a test particle, which shows that the\nplanetary motion can be represented by the superposition of the circular motion\nof a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric\ncomponents of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical\nmotion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet\nprecess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The largest forced\noscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity (which is an explicit\nfunction of the parameters of the binary and of the guiding center radius of\nthe planet), and the amplitude of the epicyclic motion (which is a free\nparameter of the theory) is the free eccentricity. Comparisons with direct\nnumerical orbit integrations show that this analytic theory gives an accurate\ndescription of the planetary motion for all three Kepler systems. We find that\nall three Kepler circumbinary planets have nonzero free eccentricities.",

This molecular species has been\nextensively detected in carbonaceous meteorites and was recently observed in\nthe cometary samples returned to Earth by NASA's Stardust spacecraft. We\npresent an experimental study on the destruction of zwitterionic glycine\ncrystals at room temperature by 1 MeV protons, in which the dependence of the\ndestruction rates of the alpha-glycine and beta-glycine crystals on bombardment\nfluence is investigated. The samples were analyzed in situ by FTIR spectrometry\nat different proton fluences at under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at the Van de\nGraaff accelerator lab at PUC-Rio, Brazil. The dissociation cross section of\nalpha-glycine was observed to be 2.5E-14 cm^-2, a value roughly 5 times higher\nthan the dissociation cross section found for beta-glycine. The estimated\nhalf-lives of alpha-glycine and beta-glycine forms extrapolated to the Earth\norbit environment are 9E5 and 4E6 years, respectively. In the diffuse\ninterstellar medium the estimated values are 1 order of magnitude lower. These\nresults suggest that pristine interstellar beta-glycine is the one most likely\nto survive the hostile environments of space radiation. A small feature around\n1650-1700 cm^-1, tentatively attributed to an amide functional group, was\nobserved in the IR spectra of irradiated samples, suggesting that cosmic rays\nmay induce peptide bond synthesis in glycine crystals.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The cosmic rays differential intensity inside the heliosphere, for energy\nbelow 30 GeV/nuc, depends on solar activity and interplanetary magnetic field\npolarity. This variation, termed solar modulation, is described using a 2-D\n(radius and colatitude) Monte Carlo approach for solving the Parker transport\nequation that includes diffusion, convection, magnetic drift and adiabatic\nenergy loss. Since the whole transport is strongly related to the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) structure, a better understanding of his\ndescription is needed in order to reproduce the cosmic rays intensity at the\nEarth, as well as outside the ecliptic plane. In this work an interplanetary\nmagnetic field model including the standard description on ecliptic region and\na polar correction is presented. This treatment of the IMF, implemented in the\nHelMod Monte Carlo code (version 2.0), was used to determine the effects on the\ndifferential intensity of Proton at 1\\,AU and allowed one to investigate how\nlatitudinal gradients of proton intensities, observed in the inner heliosphere\nwith the Ulysses spacecraft during 1995, can be affected by the modification of\nthe IMF in the polar regions.",

The\nspacecraft of most of these mission proposals go to deep space and many have\nEarthlike orbits around the Sun.

ASTROD-GW\n(Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices optimized for\nGravitation Wave detection) is to focus on the goal of detection of GWs. The\nmission orbits of the 3 spacecraft forming a nearly equilateral triangular\narray are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and L5. The 3\nspacecraft range interferometrically with one another with arm length about 260\nmillion kilometers with the scientific goals including detection of GWs from\nMassive Black Holes (MBH), and Extreme-Mass-Ratio Black Hole Inspirals (EMRI),\nand using these observations to find the evolution of the equation of state of\ndark energy and to explore the co-evolution of massive black holes with\ngalaxies. In this paper, we review the formation flying for fundamental physics\nmissions, design the preliminary transfer orbits of the ASTROD-GW spacecraft\nfrom the separations of the launch vehicles to the mission orbits, and simulate\nthe arm lengths of the triangular formation. From our study, the optimal\ndelta-Vs and propellant ratios of the transfer orbits could be within about 2.5\nkm/s and 0.55, respectively. From the simulation of the formation for 10 years,\nthe arm lengths of the formation vary in the range 1.73210 +- 0.00015 AU with\nthe arm length differences varying in the range +- 0.00025 AU for formation\nwith 1 degree inclination to the ecliptic plane.

High-cadence EUV images from the SDO/AIA and the\nAhead spacecraft of STEREO/EUVI are used to correlate three flares in the\nneighbouring active-region (NOAA 11303), and their EUV waves, with the\ndynamical developments of the tornado. The timings of the flares and EUV waves\nobserved on-disk in 195\u00c5 are analyzed in relation to the tornado activities\nobserved at the limb in 171\u00c5. Each of the three flares and its related EUV\nwave occurred within 10 hours of the onset of the tornado. They have an\nobserved causal relationship with the commencement of activity in the\nprominence where the tornado develops. Tornado-like rotations along the side of\nthe prominence start after the second flare. The prominence cavity expands with\nacceleration of tornado motion after the third flare. Flares in the\nneighbouring active region may have affected the cavity prominence system and\ntriggered the solar tornado. A plausible mechanism is that the active-region\ncoronal field contracted by the `Hudson effect' due to the loss of magnetic\nenergy as flares. Subsequently the cavity expanded by its magnetic pressure to\nfill the surrounding low corona. We suggest that the tornado is the dynamical\nresponse of the helical prominence field to the cavity expansion.",

As the spacecraft has no relationship with the MC\ntrajectory, the frequency distribution of MCs versus the spacecraft distance to\nthe MCs axis is expected to be approximately flat. However, Lepping and Wu\n(2010) confirmed that it is a strongly decreasing function of the estimated\nimpact parameter. Is a flux rope more frequently undetected for larger impact\nparameter? In order to answer the questions above, we explore the parameter\nspace of flux rope models, especially the aspect ratio, boundary shape, and\ncurrent distribution. The proposed models are analyzed as MCs by fitting a\ncircular linear force-free field to the magnetic field computed along simulated\ncrossings.\nWe find that the distribution of the twist within the flux rope, the\nnon-detection due to too low field rotation angle or magnitude are only weakly\naffecting the expected frequency distribution of MCs versus impact parameter.\nHowever, the estimated impact parameter is increasingly biased to lower values\nas the flux-rope cross section is more elongated orthogonally to the crossing\ntrajectory. The observed distribution of MCs is a natural consequence of a\nflux-rope cross section flattened in average by a factor 2 to 3 depending on\nthe magnetic twist profile. However, the faster MCs at 1 AU, with V>550 km/s,\npresent an almost uniform distribution of MCs vs. impact parameter, which is\nconsistent with round shaped flux ropes, in contrast with the slower ones.

Neutralization of\nheliosheath He+ ions, mainly by charge exchange (CX) with neutral interstellar\nH and He atoms, gives rise to ~0.2 - ~100 keV fluxes of energetic neutral He\natoms (He ENA). Such fluxes, if observed, would give information about plasmas\nin the heliosheath and heliospheric tail. Methods. Helium ions crossing the\ntermination shock (TS) constitute suprathermal (test) particles convected by\n(locally also diffusing through) hydrodynamically calculated background plasma\nflows (three versions of flows are employed). The He ions proceed from the TS\ntowards heliopause (HP) and finally to the heliospheric tail (HT). Calculations\nof the evolution of alpha- and He+ particle densities and energy spectra\ninclude binary interactions with background plasma and interstellar atoms,\nadiabatic heating (cooling) resulting from flow compression (rarefaction), and\nCoulomb scattering on background plasma. Results. Neutralization of\nsuprathermal He ions leads to the emergence of He ENA fluxes with energy\nspectra modified by the Compton-Getting effect at emission and ENA loss during\nflight to the Sun. Energy-integrated He ENA intensities are in the range ~0.05\n- ~50 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 depending on spectra at the TS (assumed\nkappa-distributions), background plasma model, and look direction. The\ntail/apex intensity ratio varies between ~1.8 and ~800 depending on model\nassumptions. Energy spectra are broad with maxima in the ~0.2 - ~3 keV range\ndepending on the look direction and model. Conclusions. Expected heliosheath He\nENA fluxes may be measurable based on the capabilities of the IBEX spacecraft.\nData could offer insight into the heliosheath structure and improve\nunderstanding of the post-TS solar wind plasmas.

Having a\nmoderate Jeans parameter Pluto's atmosphere does not fit the classic definition\nof Jeans escape for light species escaping from the terrestrial planets, nor\ndoes it fit the hydrodynamic outflow from comets and certain exoplanets. It has\nbeen proposed for some time that Pluto lies in the region of slow hydrodynamic\nescape. Using a hybrid fluid/molecular-kinetic model, we previously\ndemonstrated the typical implementation of this model fails to correctly\ndescribe the appropriate temperature structure for the upper atmosphere for\nsolar minimum conditions. Here we use a time-dependent solver to allow us to\nextend those simulations to higher heating rates and we examine fluid models in\nwhich Jeans-like escape expressions are used for the upper boundary conditions.\nWe compare these to hybrid simulations of the atmosphere under heating\nconditions roughly representative of solar minimum and mean conditions as these\nbracket conditions expected during the New Horizon encounter. Although we find\nescape rates comparable to those previously estimated by the slow hydrodynamic\nescape model, and roughly consistent with energy limited escape, our model\nproduces a much more extended atmosphere with higher temperatures roughly\nconsistent with recent observations of CO. Such an extended atmosphere will be\naffected by Charon and will affect Pluto's interaction with the solar wind at\nthe New Horizon encounter. Since we have previously shown that such models can\nbe scaled, these results have implications for modeling exoplanet atmospheres\nfor which the energy limited escape approximation is often used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The research about asteroids attracts more and more attention recently,\nespecially focusing on their physical structures, such as the spin axis, the\nrotation period and the shape. The long distance between Earth observers and\nasteroids makes it impossible to get the shape and other parameters of\nasteroids directly with the exception of the NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids) and\nothers passed by some spacecrafts. Generally photometric measurement is still\nthe main way to obtain the research data for asteroids now, i.e. the\nlightcurves recording the brightness and positions of asteroids. Supposing that\nthe shape of the asteroid is a triaxial ellipsoid with a stable spinning\nstatus, a new method is present in this article to reconstruct the shape models\nof asteroids from the lightcurves, with the other physical parameters together.\nBy applying a special curvature function, the method calculates the brightness\nintegration on a unit sphere and Lebedev Quadrature is employed for the\ndiscretization. At last the method searches the optimal solution by\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the residual of the brightness. By\nadopting this method not only related physical parameters of asteroids can be\nobtained at a reasonable accuracy, but also a simple shape model of Ellipsoid\ncan be generated for reconstructing more sophisticated shape model further.",

The total characteristic velocity to be minimized is\nreplaced by a related characteristic-value function and this related\noptimization problem can be solved in closed form. The solution of this problem\nis shown to approach the solution of the original problem in the limit as the\nboundary conditions approach those of a circular orbit. Using a form of\nprimer-vector theory the problem is formulated in a way that leads to\nrelatively easy calculation of the optimal velocity increments. A certain\nvector that can easily be calculated from the boundary conditions determines\nthe number of impulses required for solution of the optimization problem and\nalso is useful in the computation of these velocity increments.\nNecessary and sufficient conditions for boundary conditions to require\nexactly three nonsingular non-degenerate impulses for solution of the related\noptimal rendezvous problem, and a means of calculating these velocity\nincrements are presented. If necessary these velocity increments could be\ncalculated from a hand calculator containing trigonometric functions.

Applying the Lomb-Scargle and the phase dispersion\nminimisation methods, we have detected photometric variability for 44 objects\nfrom which 35 were previously unknown. The new objects are all bright stars on\nthe Ecliptic Plane (magnitude range 4.7 < V < 11.7) and will therefore be of\ngreat interest to studies of stellar structure and evolution. In particular,\nseveral show multiple signals consistent with hybrid delta Scuti and gamma\nDoradus pulsation, with different periodicities allowing very different regions\nof the stellar interior to be studied. There are two subgroups of stars in our\nsample: the cool metallic line Am (CP1) and the hot HgMn (CP3) stars. These\nobjects fall well inside the classical instability strip where delta Scuti,\ngamma Doradus and slowly pulsating B-type stars are located. We also expect to\nfind periods correlated to the orbital period for CP1 objects as they are\nmostly members of binary systems. For CP3 stars, rotationally-induced\nvariability is still a matter of debate. Although surface spots were detected,\nthey are believed to produce only marginal photometric amplitudes. So, periods\nfrom several hours to a few days were expected for these two star groups. The\nremaining 514 stars are likely to be constant in the investigated range from\n0.1 to 10 days. In some cases, the presence of blending or systematic effects\nprevented us from detecting any reliable variability and in those cases we\nclassified the star as constant. Finally, we have calibrated the variable stars\nin terms of the effective temperature and luminosity in order to estimate\nmasses and ages. For this purpose we used specifically developed calibrations\nfor CP stars and, when available, HIPPARCOS parallaxes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We demonstrate that major asymmetries in erupting filaments and CMEs, namely\nmajor twists and non-radial motions are typically related to the larger-scale\nambient environment around eruptive events. Our analysis of prominence\neruptions observed by the STEREO, SDO and SOHO spacecraft shows that prominence\nspines retain, during the initial phases, the thin ribbon-like topology they\nhad prior to the eruption. This topology allows bending, rolling, and twisting\nduring the early phase of the eruption, but not before. The combined ascent and\ninitial bending of the filament ribbon is non-radial in the same general\ndirection as for the enveloping CME. However, the non-radial motion of the\nfilament is greater than that of the CME. In considering the global magnetic\nenvironment around CMEs, as approximated by the Potential Field Source Surface\n(PFSS) model, we find that the non-radial propagation of both erupting\nfilaments and associated CMEs is correlated with the presence of nearby coronal\nholes, which deflect the erupting plasma and embedded fields. In addition, CME\nand filament motions respectively are guided towards weaker field regions,\nnamely null points existing at different heights in the overlying\nconfiguration. Due to the presence of the coronal hole, the large-scale forces\nacting on the CME may be asymmetric. We find that the CME propagates usually\nnon-radially in the direction of least resistance, which is always away from\nthe coronal hole. We demonstrate these results using both low and high latitude\nexamples.",

Both the flaring active region and the\nprominence were located near the West limb, with a favorable configuration and\nviewing angle. The fulldisk extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images of the Sun\nobtained with high spatial and temporal resolution by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, show flare-associated\nlateral oscillations of the prominence sheet. The STEREO-A spacecraft, 81.5\ndegrees ahead of the Sun-Earth line, provides on-disk view of the\nflare-associated coronal disturbances. We derive the temporal profile of the\nlateral displacement of the prominence sheet by using the image\ncross-correlation technique. The displacement curve was de-trended and the\nresidual oscillatory pattern was derived. We fit these oscillations with a\ndamped cosine function with a variable period and find that the period is\nincreasing. The initial oscillation period (P0) is 28.2 minutes and the damping\ntime (t_D) of 44 minutes. We confirm the presence of fast and slow EUV wave\ncomponents. Using STEREO-A observations we derive a propagation speed of 250\nkm/s for the slow EUV wave by applying time-slice technique to the running\ndifference images. We propose that the prominence oscillations are excited by\nthe fast EUV wave while the increase in oscillation period of the prominence is\nan apparent effect, related to a phase change due to the slow EUV wave acting\nas a secondary trigger. We discuss implications of the dual trigger effect for\ncoronal prominence seismology and scaling law studies of damping mechanisms.",

The filament eruption was associated\nwith a relatively slow coronal mass ejection (CME). The filament consisted of a\nlarge and a small part, both parts erupted nearly simultaneously. Here we focus\non the eruption associated with the larger part of the filament. The STEREO\nsatellites were separated by about 117 degree during this event, so we\nadditionally used SoHO/EIT and CORONAS/TESIS observations as a third eye (Earth\nview) to aid our measurements. We measure the plane-of-sky trajectory of the\nfilament as seen from STEREO-A and TESIS view-points. Using a simple\ntrigonometric relation, we then use these measurements to estimate the true\ndirection of propagation of the filament which allows us to derive the true\nR=R_sun v/s time profile of the filament apex. Furthermore, we develop a new\ntomographic method that can potentially provide a more robust three-dimensional\nreconstruction by exploiting multiple simultaneous views. We apply this method\nalso to investigate the 3D evolution of the top part of filament. We expect\nthis method to be useful when SDO and STEREO observations are combined. We then\nanalyze the kinematics of the eruptive filament during its rapid acceleration\nphase by fitting different functional forms to the height-time data derived\nfrom the two methods. We find that, for both methods, an exponential function\nfits the rise profile of the filament slightly better than parabolic or cubic\nfunctions.

These lightcurves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of\nthe thermal phase effect for WASP-18b. We find that our results for the thermal\nphase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01% by systematic noise\nsources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal\nphase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary\neclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at\nthe same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 degrees at 3.6 micron and\nto within about 10 degrees at 4.5 micron. The shape and amplitude of the\nthermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the\natmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the\nsystem geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering the\noccultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6\nmicron and 4.5 micron are in good agreement with previous measurements and\nimply a very low albedo for WASP-18b. The parameters of the system (masses,\nradii, etc.) derived from our analysis are in also good agreement with those\nfrom previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution\nimaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity\nto check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our\nresults. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to\nthe flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find\nthat there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear\nephemeris greater than about 100 seconds over 3 years.",

The Visual and Infrared Mapping\nSpectrometer (VIMS) instrument onboard the Cassini Spacecraft has obtained\nspectra of the rings between 0.35 and 5.2 microns with sufficient spatial\nresolution to discern variations on scales below 200 km. These relatively\nhigh-resolution spectral data reveal that both the depths of the near-infrared\nwater-ice absorption bands and the visible spectral slopes are often correlated\nwith structural parameters such as the rings' optical depth. Using a simplified\nmodel for the ring-particles' regolith properties, we have begun to disentangle\nthe trends due to changes in the gross composition of the ring particles from\nthose that may be due to shifts in the texture of the ring particles' regolith.\nConsistent with previous studies, this analysis finds that the C ring and the\nCassini Division possess enhanced concentrations of a contaminant that absorbs\nlight over a broad range of wavelengths. On the other hand, a second\ncontaminant that preferentially absorbs at short visible and near-ultraviolet\nwavelengths is found to be more evenly distributed throughout the rings. The\noptical activity of this short-wavelength absorber increases in the inner B\nring inwards of 100,000 km from Saturn center, which may provide clues to the\norigin of this contaminant. The spectral variations identified as shifts in the\nregolith texture are in some places clearly correlated with the ring's optical\ndepth, and in other locations they appear to be associated with the\ndisturbances generated by strong mean-motion resonances with Saturn's various\nmoons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present the discovery of a long-term stable L5 (trailing) Neptune Trojan\nin data acquired to search for candidate Trans-Neptunian objects for the New\nHorizons spacecraft to fly by during an extended post-Pluto mission. This\nNeptune Trojan, 2011 HM102, has the highest inclination (29.4 degrees) of any\nknown member of this population. It is intrinsically brighter than any single\nL5 Jupiter Trojan at H~8.18. We have determined its gri colors (a first for any\nL5 Neptune Trojan), which we find to be similar to the moderately red colors of\nthe L4 Neptune Trojans, suggesting similar surface properties for members of\nboth Trojan clouds. We also present colors derived from archival data for two\nL4 Neptune Trojans (2006 RJ103 and 2007 VL305), better refining the overall\ncolor distribution of the population. In this document we describe the\ndiscovery circumstances, our physical characterization of 2011 HM102, and this\nobject's implications for the Neptune Trojan population overall. Finally, we\ndiscuss the prospects for detecting 2011 HM102 from the New Horizons spacecraft\nduring their close approach in mid- to late-2013.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This thesis strives to improve our understanding of solar activity,\nspecifically the behaviour of solar flares and coronal mass ejections. An\ninvestigation into the hydrodynamic evolution of a confined solar flare was\ncarried out using RHESSI, CDS, GOES and TRACE. Evidence for pre-flare heating,\nexplosive and gentle chromospheric evaporation and loop draining were observed\nin the data. The observations were compared to a 0-D hydrodynamic model, EBTEL,\nto aid interpretation. This led to the conclusion that the flare was not heated\npurely by non-thermal beam heating as previously believed, but also required\ndirect heating of the plasma. An observational investigation in to the\ninitiation mechanism of a coronal mass ejection and eruptive flare was then\ncarried out, again utilising observations from a wide range of spacecraft:\nMESSENGER/SAX, RHESSI, EUVI, Cor1 and Cor2. Observations provided evidence of\nCME triggering by internal tether-cutting and not by breakout reconnection. A\ncomparison of the confined and eruptive flares suggests that while they have\ndifferent characteristics, timescales and topologies, these two phenomena are\nthe result of the same fundamental processes. Finally, an investigation into\nthe sensitivity of EUV imaging telescopes was carried out. This study\nestablished a new technique for calculating the sensitivity of EUV imagers to\nplasmas of different temperatures for four different types of plasma: coronal\nhole, quiet sun, active region and solar flare. This was carried out for six\ninstruments: Proba-2/SWAP, TRACE, SOHO/EIT, STEREO A/EUVI, STEREO B/EUVI and\nSDO/AIA. The importance of considering the multi-thermal nature of these\ninstruments was then put into the context of investigating explosive solar\nactivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present results from large-scale particle simulations of the viscous\noverstability in Saturn's rings. The overstability generates a variety of\nstructure on scales covering a few hundred metres to several kilometres,\nincluding axisymmetric wavetrains and larger-scale modulations. Such patterns\nhave been observed in Saturn's rings by the Cassini spacecraft. Our simulations\nmodel the collisional evolution of particles in a co-rotating patch of the\ndisk. These are the largest N-body simulations of the viscous overstability yet\nperformed. The radial box size is five orders of magnitude larger than a\ntypical particle radius, and so describes a 20-50 km radial portion of the\nrings. Its evolution is tracked for more than 10,000 orbits. In agreement with\nhydrodynamics, our N-body simulations reveal that the viscous overstability\nexhibits a rich set of dynamics characterised by nonlinear travelling waves\nwith wavelengths of a few hundred meters. In addition, wave defects, such as\nsources and shocks, punctuate this bed of waves and break them up into\nlarge-scale divisions of radial width ~5 km. We find that the wavelength of the\ntravelling waves is positively correlated with the mean optical depth. In order\nto assess the role of the numerical boundary conditions and also background\nring structure, we include simulations of broad spreading rings and simulations\nwith a gradient in the background surface density. Overall, our numerical\nresults and approach provide a tool with which to interpret Cassini occultation\nobservations of microstructure in Saturn's rings. We present an example of such\na synthetic occultation observation and discuss what features to expect. We\nalso make the entire source code freely available.",

We find that the average area of magnetic cells on the solar\nsurface at lower latitudes (within +-50 degree) are smaller than those at\nhigher latitudes (beyond +-50 degree). Statistical analysis of these data\nindicates that the magnetic networks are of fractal in nature, and the average\nfractal dimension is D_f = 1.253+-0.011. We also find that both the fractal\ndimension and the size of the magnetic networks are anti-correlated with the\nsunspot area. This is perhaps because a strong magnetic field can suppress\nspatially modulated oscillation, compress the boundaries of network cells,\nleading to smoother cell boundaries. The fractal dimension of the cell deviates\nthat predicted from an isobar of Kolmogorov homogeneous turbulence.",

Finally, we compare the shape of the density spectrum at ion\nscales to theoretical predictions based on a cascade model for kinetic\nturbulence. We conclude that the shape of the spectrum, including the ion scale\nflattening, can be captured by the sum of passive density fluctuations at large\nscales and kinetic Alfven wave turbulence at small scales.",

Also thermosphere\nup-welling that often accompanies the dayside field-aligned currents in the\ninner cusp was seen. We used Cluster and CHAMP satellites, and searched for\nconjunctions during the whole year of 2008, as then the Cluster spacecrafts\nwere mostly at mid-altitudes when crossing the cusps.

Evidence is presented that sheets of small scale\nfield-aligned current continue through the low altitude cusp and ionosphere.\nThe ionospheric current densities are not particularly strong, a few micro A/m2\nat about 340 km, and several tens of nA/m2 at about 20000 km, implying that\nthese currents might be relatively common events, but are hard to detect due to\nrareness of suitable locations of at least two satellites from different\nmissions.",

This alignment controls the strength of the non-linear\ninteractions and, therefore, the turbulence. We find that at scales larger than\nthe outer scale of the turbulence the Elsasser fluctuations become on average\nmore anti-aligned as the outer scale is approached from above. Conditioning\nstructure functions using the alignment angle reveals turbulent scaling of\nunaligned fluctuations at scales previously believed to lie outside the\nturbulent cascade in the `1/f range'.

The aim is to investigate the\nexistence of propagating waves in the solar chromosphere and the transition\nregion via analyzing the statistical distribution of power in different\nlocations, e.g. in bright magnetic (network), bright non-magnetic and dark\nnon-magnetic (inter-network) regions, separately. We use Fourier power and\nphase-difference techniques combined with a wavelet analysis. Two-dimensional\nFourier power maps were constructed in the period bands 2-4 minutes, 4-6\nminutes, 6-15 minutes, and beyond 15 minutes. We detect the presence of\nlong-period oscillations with periods between 15 and 30 minutes in bright\nmagnetic regions. These oscillations were detected from the chromosphere to the\ntransition region. The Fourier power maps show that short-period powers are\nmainly concentrated in dark regions whereas long-period powers are concentrated\nin bright magnetic regions. This is the first report of long-period waves in\nquiet-Sun network regions. We suggest that the observed propagating\noscillations are due to magnetoacoustic waves which can be important for the\nheating of the solar atmosphere.",
