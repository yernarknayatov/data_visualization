    "abstract": "Abstract:  We review the importance of recent UV observations of solar system targets\nand discuss the need for further measurements, instrumentation and laboratory\nwork in the coming decade.\nIn the past decade, numerous important advances have been made in solar\nsystem science using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic techniques. Formerly used\nnearly exclusively for studies of giant planet atmospheres, planetary\nexospheres and cometary emissions, UV imaging spectroscopy has recently been\nmore widely applied. The geyser-like plume at Saturn's moon Enceladus was\ndiscovered in part as a result of UV stellar occultation observations, and this\ntechnique was used to characterize the plume and jets during the entire Cassini\nmission. Evidence for a similar style of activity has been found at Jupiter's\nmoon Europa using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV emission and absorption\nimaging. At other moons and small bodies throughout the solar system, UV\nspectroscopy has been utilized to search for activity, probe surface\ncomposition, and delineate space weathering effects; UV photometric studies\nhave been used to uncover regolith structure. Insights from UV imaging\nspectroscopy of solar system surfaces have been gained largely in the last 1-2\ndecades, including studies of surface composition, space weathering effects\n(e.g. radiolytic products) and volatiles on asteroids (e.g.\n[2][39][48][76][84]), the Moon (e.g. [30][46][49]), comet nuclei (e.g. [85])\nand icy satellites (e.g. [38][41-44][45][47][65]). The UV is sensitive to some\nspecies, minor contaminants and grain sizes often not detected in other\nspectral regimes.\nIn the coming decade, HST observations will likely come to an end. New\ninfrastructure to bolster future UV studies is critically needed. These needs\ninclude both developmental work to help improve future UV observations and\nlaboratory work to help interpret spacecraft data. UV instrumentation will be a\ncritical tool on missions to a variety of targets in the coming decade,\nespecially for the rapidly expanding application of UV reflectance\ninvestigations of atmosphereless bodies.",

By taking advantage of the quadrature\nposition of these spacecraft from October 2010 until September 2011, we\ninspected the 3D trajectory of CMEs and their associated prominences with\nrespect to their solar sources by means of a tie-pointing tool and a forward\nmodel. Considering the coronal magnetic fields as computed from a potential\nfield source surface model, we investigate the roles of magnetic energy\ndistribution and kinematic features in the non-radial propagation of both\nstructures. The magnetic environment present during the eruption is found to be\ncrucial in determining the trajectory of CMEs, in agreement with previous\nreports.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Understanding extreme space weather events is of paramount importance in\nefforts to protect technological systems in space and on the ground.\nParticularly in the thermosphere, the subsequent extreme magnetic storms can\npose serious threats to low-Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft by intensifying errors\nin orbit predictions. Extreme magnetic storms (minimum Dst $\\leq$ --250 nT) are\nextremely rare: only 7 events occurred during the era of spacecraft with\nhigh-level accelerometers such as CHAMP (CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload) and\nGRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate experiment), and none with minimum Dst\n$\\leq$ --500 nT, here termed magnetic superstorms. Therefore, current knowledge\nof thermospheric mass density response to superstorms is very limited. Thus, in\norder to advance this knowledge, four known magnetic superstorms in history,\ni.e., events occurring before CHAMP's and GRACE's commission times, with\ncomplete datasets, are used to empirically estimate density enhancements and\nsubsequent orbital drag. The November 2003 magnetic storm (minimum Dst = --422\nnT), the most extreme event observed by both satellites, is used as the\nbenchmark event. Results show that, as expected, orbital degradation is more\nsevere for the most intense storms. Additionally, results clearly point out\nthat the time duration of the storm is strongly associated with storm-time\norbital drag effects, being as important as or even more important than storm\nintensity itself. The most extreme storm-time decays during CHAMP/GRACE-like\nsample satellite orbits estimated for the March 1989 magnetic superstorm show\nthat long-lasting superstorms can have highly detrimental consequences for the\norbital dynamics of satellites in LEO.",

Theoretically it could also enable interstellar missions,\nbut an extremely small mass per cross section area is required to overcome the\nsolar gravity. We identify aerographite, a synthetic carbon-based foam with a\ndensity of 0.18 kg/m^3 (15,000 times more lightweight than aluminum) as a\nversatile material for highly efficient propulsion with sunlight. A hollow\naerographite sphere with a shell thickness eps_shl = 1 mm could go interstellar\nupon submission to the solar radiation in interplanetary space. Upon launch at\n1 AU from the Sun, an aerographite shell with eps_shl = 0.5 mm arrives at the\norbit of Mars in 60 d and at Pluto's orbit in 4.3 yr. Release of an\naerographite hollow sphere, whose shell is 1 micrometer thick, at 0.04 AU (the\nclosest approach of the Parker Solar Probe) results in an escape speed of\nnearly 6900 km/s and 185 yr of travel to the distance of our nearest star,\nProxima Centauri. The infrared signature of a meter-sized aerographite sail\ncould be observed with JWST up to 2 AU from the Sun, beyond the orbit of Mars.\nAn aerographite hollow sphere with eps_shl = 100 micrometer and a radius of 1 m\n(5 m) weighs 230 mg (5.7 g) and has a 2.2 g (55 g) mass margin for interstellar\nescape. The payload margin is ten times the mass of the spacecraft, whereas the\npayload on chemical interstellar rockets is typically a thousandth of the\nweight of the rocket. Simplistic communication would enable studies of the\ninterplanetary medium and a search for the suspected Planet Nine, and would\nserve as a precursor mission to alpha Centauri. We estimate prototype\ndevelopments costs of 1 million USD, a price of 1000 USD per sail, and a total\nof <10 million USD including launch for a piggyback concept with an\ninterplanetary mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We consider the history of New Horizons target (486958) Arrokoth in the\ncontext of its sublimative evolution. Shortly after the Sun's protoplanetary\ndisk (PPD) cleared, the newly intense sunlight sparked a sublimative period in\nArrokoth's early history that lasted for ~10-100 Myr. Although this sublimation\nwas too weak to significantly alter Arrokoth's spin state, it could drive mass\ntransport around the surface significant enough to erase topographic features\non length scales of ~10-100 m. This includes craters up to ~50-500 m in\ndiameter, which suggests that the majority of Arrokoth's craters may not be\nprimordial (dating from the merger of Arrokoth's lobes), but rather could date\nfrom after the end of this sublimative period. Thereafter, Arrokoth entered a\nQuiescent Period (which lasts to the present day), in which volatile production\nrates are at least 13 orders of magnitude less than the ~10^24 molecules/s\ndetection limit of the New Horizons spacecraft (Lisse et al. 2020). This is\ninsufficient to drive either mass transport or sublimative torques. These\nresults suggest that the observed surface of Arrokoth is not primordial, but\nrather dates from the Quiescent Period. By contrast, the inability of\nsublimative torques to meaningfully alter Arrokoth's rotation state suggests\nthat its shape is indeed primordial, and its observed rotation is\nrepresentative of its spin state after formation.",

VTXO will perform X-ray observations with an angular\nresolution around 50 milliarcseconds, an order of magnitude better than is\nachievable by current state of the art X-ray telescopes. VTXOs fine angular\nresolution enables measuring the environments closer to the central engines in\ncompact X-ray sources. This resolution will be achieved by the use of Phased\nFresnel Lenses (PFLs) optics which provide near diffraction-limited imaging in\nthe X-ray band. However, PFLs require long focal lengths in order to realize\ntheir imaging performance, for VTXO this dictates that the telescopes optics\nand the camera will have a separation of 1 km. As it is not realistic to build\na structure this large in space, the solution being adapted for VTXO is to\nplace the camera, and the optics on two separate spacecraft and fly them in\nformation with the necessary spacing. This requires centimeter level control,\nand sub-millimeter level knowledge of the two spacecrafts relative transverse\nposition. This paper will present VTXOs current baseline, with particular\nemphasis on the missions flight dynamics design.",

PFLs promise to\nprovide several orders of magnitude improvement in angular resolution over\ncurrent state of the art X-ray optics. However, PFLs for astronomical\napplications require a long focal length, for VTXO the focal length is\nestimated to be in the range of 0.5 km to 4 km. Since these focal lengths are\nnot feasible on a single spacecraft, the proposed solution is to use two\nseparate spacecraft, one with the lense(s), and the second with an X-ray\ncamera. These two spacecrafts will then fly in a formation approximating a\nsingle rigid telescope. In order to achieve this configuration, the two\nspacecraft must maintain the formation a focal length distance apart, with\ncentimeter level control, and sub-millimeter level knowledge requirements.\nAdditionally, the system must keep the telescope axis pointed at a fixed target\non the celestial sphere for extended durations. VTXOs system architecture calls\nfor two CubeSats to operate in a highly eccentric Earth orbit with one of the\nspacecrafts traveling on a natural keplarian orbit. The second spacecraft will\nthen fly on a pseudo orbit maintaining a fixed offset during observations.\nObservations with this system will occur near apogee where differential forces\non the spacecrafts are minimal which in turn minimizes fuel consumption. This\npaper overviews VTXOs system architecture, and looks in depth at the formation\nflying techniques, including fuel consumption, and methods maintaining the\nformation. Beyond its use in X-ray astronomy, these formations flying\ntechniques should eventually contribute to the development of distributed\naperture telescopes, with imaging performance orders of magnitude better than\nthe current state of the art.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Very low Earth orbits (VLEO), typically classified as orbits below\napproximately 450 km in altitude, have the potential to provide significant\nbenefits to spacecraft over those that operate in higher altitude orbits. This\npaper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of these benefits to\nspacecraft operations in VLEO, with parametric investigation of those which\napply specifically to Earth observation missions. The most significant benefit\nfor optical imaging systems is that a reduction in orbital altitude improves\nspatial resolution for a similar payload specification. Alternatively mass and\nvolume savings can be made whilst maintaining a given performance. Similarly,\nfor radar and lidar systems, the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved.\nAdditional benefits include improved geospatial position accuracy, improvements\nin communications link-budgets, and greater launch vehicle insertion\ncapability. The collision risk with orbital debris and radiation environment\ncan be shown to be improved in lower altitude orbits, whilst compliance with\nIADC guidelines for spacecraft post-mission lifetime and deorbit is also\nassisted. Finally, VLEO offers opportunities to exploit novel\natmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems and aerodynamic attitude and\norbit control methods.\nHowever, key challenges associated with our understanding of the lower\nthermosphere, aerodynamic drag, the requirement to provide a meaningful orbital\nlifetime whilst minimising spacecraft mass and complexity, and atomic oxygen\nerosion still require further research. Given the scope for significant\ncommercial, societal, and environmental impact which can be realised with\nhigher performing Earth observation platforms, renewed research efforts to\naddress the challenges associated with VLEO operations are required.",

One of the intervals is\ninvestigated in more detail and the power spectral density of the compressive\nfluctuations is measured from the inertial range to the sub-ion range. The\nmorphology of the density spectra can be explained by either a cascade of\nAlfv\u00e9n waves and slow waves at large scales and kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves at\nsub-ion scales, or more generally by the Hall effect.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Challenging space missions include those at very low altitudes, where the\natmosphere is source of aerodynamic drag on the spacecraft. To extend such\nmissions lifetime, an efficient propulsion system is required. One solution is\nAtmosphere-Breathing Electric Propulsion (ABEP). It collects atmospheric\nparticles to be used as propellant for an electric thruster. The system would\nminimize the requirement of limited propellant availability and can also be\napplied to any planet with atmosphere, enabling new mission at low altitude\nranges for longer times. Challenging is also the presence of reactive chemical\nspecies, such as atomic oxygen in Earth orbit. Such species cause erosion of\n(not only) propulsion system components, i.e. acceleration grids, electrodes,\nand discharge channels of conventional EP systems. IRS is developing within the\nDISCOVERER project, an intake and a thruster for an ABEP system. The paper\ndescribes the design and implementation of the RF helicon-based inductive\nplasma thruster (IPT). This paper deals in particular with the design and\nimplementation of a novel antenna called the birdcage antenna, a device well\nknown in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and also lately employed for\nhelicon-wave based plasma sources in fusion research. The IPT is based on RF\nelectrodeless operation aided by an externally applied static magnetic field.\nThe IPT is composed by an antenna, a discharge channel, a movable injector, and\na solenoid. By changing the operational parameters along with the novel antenna\ndesign, the aim is to minimize losses in the RF circuit, and accelerate a\nquasi-neutral plasma plume. This is also to be aided by the formation of\nhelicon waves within the plasma that are to improve the overall efficiency and\nachieve higher exhaust velocities. Finally, the designed IPT with a particular\nfocus on the birdcage antenna design procedure is presented",

In this paper we present a statistical\nanalysis of bulk and suprathermal electron dynamics, as well as a case study of\nsuprathermal electron pitch angle distributions (PADs) near a diamagnetic\nregion. Bulk electron densities are correlated with the local neutral density\nand we find a distinct enhancement in electron densities measured over the\nsouthern latitudes of the comet. Flux of suprathermal electrons with energies\nbetween tens of eV to a couple of hundred eV decreases each time the spacecraft\nenters a diamagnetic region. We propose a mechanism in which this reduction can\nbe explained by solar wind electrons that are tied to the magnetic field and\nafter having been transported adiabatically in a decaying magnetic field\nenvironment, have limited access to the diamagnetic regions. Our analysis shows\nthat suprathermal electron PADs evolve from an almost isotropic outside the\ndiamagnetic cavity to a field-aligned distribution near the boundary. Electron\ntransport becomes chaotic and non-adiabatic when electron gyroradius becomes\ncomparable to the size of the magnetic field line curvature, which determines\nthe upper energy limit of the flux variation. This study is based on Rosetta\nobservations at around 200 km cometocentric distance when the comet was at 1.24\nAU from the Sun and during the southern summer cometary season.",

During mid-1998, the cadence of EIT images was revised from two images\nper day to 12 minutes.

Therefore, we monitor\npossible errors in flare detection by flare parameters such as temporal\noverlap, observational wavelength, and considering full field of view (FOV)\nimages. We consider the GOES flare catalog as the primary source. We describe\nthe technique used to enhance the GOES detected flares using the Extreme\nUltraviolet (EUV) image captured by the EIT instrument. In order to detect\nbrightenings, we subtract the images with a maximum cadence of 25 minutes. We\nhave downloaded and analyzed the EIT data via the Virtual Solar Observatory\n(VSO). This flare dataset from the SOHO/EIT period proves indispensable to the\nprocess of the solar flare predictions as the instrument has covered most of\nSolar Cycle 23.",

We find that the number of SFRs detected near the Sun is much less\nthan that at larger radial distances, where magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence may act as the local source to produce these structures. The\nprevalence of Alfvenic structures significantly suppresses the detection of\nSFRs at closer distances.

Different\nmethods can be used to observe meteors, allowing us to study small\ninterplanetary fragments, which would otherwise remain undetected. Numerous\nimpressive meteor showers, storms and meteorite impacts have occurred\nthroughout the recorded history and can now be predicted and analyzed in much\nmore detail. By understanding the dynamics, composition and physical properties\nof meteoroids, we are able to study the formation history and dynamical\nevolution of the solar system.

The\nmodel is found to accurately reproduce observed large-scale off-limb\nstructures. When discrepancies do arise they mainly occur off the east solar\nlimb due to active regions emerging on the far side of the Sun, which cannot be\nincorporated into the model until they are observed on the Earth-facing side.\nWhen such ``late'' active region emergences are incorporated into the model, we\nfind that the simulated corona self-corrects within a few days, so that\nsimulated structures off the west limb more closely match what is observed.\nWhere the model is less successful, we consider how this may be addressed,\nthrough model developments or additional observational products.",

However, little is known on how\nlocal measurements compare to global measurements of expansion. Here, we\npresent results from the analysis of 42 CMEs measured in the inner heliosphere\nby two spacecraft in radial conjunction. The magnetic field decrease with\ndistance provides a measure of their global expansion. Near 1 au, the decrease\nin their bulk speed provides a measure of their local expansion. We find that\nthese two measures have little relation with each other. We also investigate\nthe relation between characteristics of CME expansion and CME properties. We\nfind that the expansion depends on the initial magnetic field strength inside\nthe ME, but not significantly on the magnetic field inside the ME measured near\n1 au. This is an indirect evidence that CME expansion in the innermost\nheliosphere is driven by the high magnetic pressure inside the ME, while by the\ntime the MEs reach 1 au, they are expanding due to the decrease in the solar\nwind dynamic pressure with distance. We also determine the evolution of the ME\ntangential and normal magnetic field components with distance, revealing\nsignificant deviations as compared to the expectations from force-free field\nconfigurations as well as some evidence that the front half of MEs expand at a\nfaster rate than the back half.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Since Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the major drivers of space weather,\nit is crucial to study their evolution starting from the inner corona. In this\nwork we use Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to study the 3D evolution\nof 59 CMEs in the inner ($<$ 3R$_{\\odot}$) and outer ($>$ 3R$_{\\odot}$) corona\nusing observations from COR-1 and COR-2 on-board Solar TErrestrial RElations\nObservatory (STEREO) spacecraft. We identify the source regions of these CMEs\nand classify them as CMEs associated with Active Regions (ARs), Active\nProminences (APs), and Prominence Eruptions (PEs). We find 27 $\\%$ of CMEs show\ntrue expansion and 31 $\\%$ show true deflections as they propagate outwards.\nUsing 3D kinematic profiles of CMEs, we connect the evolution of true\nacceleration with the evolution of true width in the inner and outer corona.\nThereby providing the observational evidence for the influence of the Lorentz\nforce on the kinematics to lie in the height range of $2.5-3$ R$_{\\odot}$. We\nfind a broad range in the distribution of peak 3D speeds and accelerations\nranging from 396 to 2465 km~s$^{-1}$ and 176 to 10922 m~s$^{-2}$ respectively\nwith a long tail towards high values coming mainly from CMEs originating from\nARs or APs. Further, we find the magnitude of true acceleration is be inversely\ncorrelated to its duration with a power law index of -1.19. We believe that\nthese results will provide important inputs for the planning of upcoming space\nmissions which will observe the inner corona and the models that study CME\ninitiation and propagation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present an analysis of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the\nHeliospheric Imagers (HIs) on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory (STEREO) spacecraft. Between August 2008 and April 2014 we identify\n273 CMEs that are observed simultaneously, by the HIs on both spacecraft. For\neach CME, we track the observed leading edge, as a function of time, from both\nvantage points, and apply the Stereoscopic Self-Similar Expansion (SSSE)\ntechnique to infer their propagation throughout the inner heliosphere. The\ntechnique is unable to accurately locate CMEs when their observed leading edge\npasses between the spacecraft, however, we are able to successfully apply the\ntechnique to 151, most of which occur once the spacecraft separation angle\nexceeds 180 degrees, during solar maximum. We find that using a small\nhalf-width to fit the CME can result in observed acceleration to unphysically\nhigh velocities and that using a larger half-width can fail to accurately\nlocate the CMEs close to the Sun because the method does not account for CME\nover-expansion in this region. Observed velocities from SSSE are found to agree\nwell with single-spacecraft (SSEF) analysis techniques applied to the same\nevents. CME propagation directions derived from SSSE and SSEF analysis agree\npoorly because of known limitations present in the latter.

Thermochemical equilibrium is\nexpected to control the composition in the deeper, hotter regions of the\natmosphere on both planets, but disequilibrium chemical processes such as\ntransport-induced quenching and photochemistry alter the composition in the\nupper atmospheric regions that can be probed remotely.

These events were also observed\nby the Very Large Array (VLA), which was monitoring the Sun at radio\nwavelengths, allowing time-dependent Faraday rotation observations to be made\nof both events. We use the white-light imaging and radio data to model the 3-D\nfield geometry of both CMEs, assuming a magnetic flux rope geometry. For CME-2,\nwe also consider 1 au in situ field measurements in the analysis, as this CME\nhits STEREO-A on August~6, making this the first CME with observational\nconstraints from stereoscopic coronal imaging, radio Faraday rotation, and in\nsitu plasma measurements combined. The imaging and in situ observations of\nCME-2 provide two clear predictions for the radio data; namely that VLA should\nobserve positive rotation measures (RMs) when the radio line of sight first\nencounters the CME, and that the sign should reverse to negative within a\ncouple hours. The initial positive RMs are in fact observed. The expected sign\nreversal is not, but the VLA data unfortunately end too soon to be sure of the\nsignificance of this discrepancy. We interpret an RM increase prior to the\nexpected occultation time of the CME as a signature of a sheath region of\ndeflected field ahead of the CME itself.",

We found\nthat KELT-1b shows significant phase variation in the TESS bandpass, with a\nrelatively large phase amplitude of $234^{+43}_{-44}$ ppm and a secondary\neclipse depth of $371^{+47}_{-49}$ ppm. We also measured a marginal eastward\noffset in the dayside hotspot of $18.3^\\circ\\pm7.4^\\circ$ relative to the\nsubstellar point. We detected a strong phase curve signal attributed to\nellipsoidal distortion of the host star, with an amplitude of $399\\pm19$ ppm.\nOur results are roughly consistent with the Spitzer phase curves of KELT-1b\n(Beatty et al. 2019), but the TESS eclipse depth is deeper than expected. Our\ncloud-free 1D models of KELT-1b's dayside emission are unable to fit the full\ncombined eclipse spectrum. Instead, the large TESS eclipse depth suggests that\nKELT-1b may have a significant dayside geometric albedo of\n$\\mathrm{A}_\\mathrm{g}\\sim0.5$ in the TESS bandpass, which would agree with the\ntentative trend between equilibrium temperature and geometric albedo recently\nsuggested by Wong et al. 2020. We posit that if KELT-1b has a high dayside\nalbedo, it is likely due to silicate clouds (Gao et al. 2020) that form on\nKELT-1b's nightside (Beatty et al. 2019, Keating et al. 2019) and are\nsubsequently transported onto the western side of KELT-1b's dayside hemisphere\nbefore breaking up.",

Ground based observations have found that simultaneously observed SO2\nand H2O at ~64 km vary with time and are temporally anti-correlated. To\nunderstand these observations, we explore the sulfur-water chemical system\nusing a one-dimensional chemistry-diffusion model. We find that SO2 and H2O\nmixing ratios above the clouds are highly dependent on mixing ratios of the two\nspecies at the middle cloud top (58 km). The behavior of sulfur-water chemical\nsystem can be classified into three regimes but there is no abrupt transition\namong these regimes. In particular, there is no bifurcation behavior as\npreviously claimed. We also find that the SO2 self-shielding effect causes H2O\nabove the clouds to respond to the middle cloud top in a non-monotonic fashion.\nThrough comparison with observations, we find that mixing ratio variations at\nthe middle cloud top can explain the observed variability of SO2 and H2O. The\nsulfur-water chemistry in the middle atmosphere is responsible for the H2O-SO2\nanti-correlation at 64 km. Eddy transport change alone cannot explain the\nvariations of both species. These results imply that variations of species\nabundance in the middle atmosphere are significantly influenced by the lower\natmospheric processes. Continued ground-based measurements of the co-evolution\nof SO2 and H2O above the clouds and new spacecraft missions will be crucial for\nuncover the complicated processes underlying the interaction among the lower\natmosphere, the clouds and the middle atmosphere of Venus.",

Launched in October 1959 on a translunar trajectory with\nlarge semi-major axis and eccentricity, it collided with the Earth in late\nMarch 1960. The short, 6-month dynamical lifetime has often been explained\nthrough an increase in eccentricity due to the Lidov-Kozai effect. However, the\nclassical Lidov-Kozai solution is only valid in the limit of small semi-major\naxis ratio, a condition that is satisfied only for solar (but not for lunar)\nperturbations. We undertook a study of the dynamics of Luna 3 with the aim of\nassessing the principal mechanisms affecting its evolution. We analyze the Luna\n3 trajectory by generating accurate osculating solutions, and by comparing them\nto integrations of singly- and doubly-averaged equations of motion in vectorial\nform. Lunar close encounters, which cannot be reproduced in an averaging\napproach, decisively affect the trajectory and break the doubly-averaged\ndynamics. Solar perturbations induce oscillations of intermediate period that\naffect the geometry of the close encounters and cause the singly-averaged and\nosculating inclinations to change quadrants (the orbital plane ``flips''). We\nfind that the peculiar evolution of Luna 3 can only be explained by taking into\naccount lunar close encounters and intermediate-period terms; such terms are\naveraged out in the Lidov-Kozai solution, which is not adequate to describe\ntranslunar or cislunar trajectories. Understanding the limits of the\nLidov-Kozai solution is of particular significance for the motion of objects in\nthe Earth-Moon environment and of exoplanetary systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Tidal effects in planetary systems are the main driver in the orbital\nmigration of natural satellites. They result from physical processes occurring\ndeep inside celestial bodies, whose effects are rarely observable from surface\nimaging. For giant planet systems, the tidal migration rate is determined by\npoorly understood dissipative processes in the planet, and standard theories\nsuggest an orbital expansion rate inversely proportional to the power 11/2 in\ndistance, implying little migration for outer moons such as Saturn's largest\nmoon, Titan. Here, we use two independent measurements obtained with the\nCassini spacecraft to measure Titan's orbital expansion rate. We find Titan\nmigrates away from Saturn at 11.3 $\\pm$ 2.0 cm/year, corresponding to a tidal\nquality factor of Saturn of Q $\\simeq$ 100, and a migration timescale of\nroughly 10 Gyr. This rapid orbital expansion suggests Titan formed\nsignificantly closer to Saturn and has migrated outward to its current\nposition. Our results for Titan and five other moons agree with the predictions\nof a resonance locking tidal theory, sustained by excitation of inertial waves\ninside the planet. The associated tidal expansion is only weakly sensitive to\norbital distance, motivating a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's\nmoon system. The resonance locking mechanism could operate in other systems\nsuch as stellar binaries and exoplanet systems, and it may allow for tidal\ndissipation to occur at larger orbital separations than previously believed.",

Astrophysically, the model is similar to but more fundamental\nthan Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with the Newtonian gravity $g_{_N}$\ntowards an isolated point mass boosted by the factor $\\nu = 1 + \\left( \\alpha/x\n\\right) \\tanh \\left( \\sqrt{x}/\\alpha \\right)$, where $x \\equiv g_{_N}/a_{_0}$\nand $a_{_0} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$ is the MOND acceleration constant.\nWe show that $\\alpha$ must lie in the range ${0.4-1}$ to acceptably fit galaxy\nrotation curves. In the Solar System, this interpolating function implies an\nextra Sunwards acceleration of ${\\alpha a_{_0}}$. This would cause Saturn to\ndeviate from Newtonian expectations by ${7000 \\left( \\alpha/0.4 \\right)}$ km\nover 15 years, starting from known initial position and velocity on a\nnear-circular orbit. We demonstrate that this prediction should not be\nsignificantly altered by the postulated dipole haloes of other planets due to\nthe rather small region in which each planet's gravity dominates over that of\nthe Sun. The orbit of Saturn should similarly be little affected by a possible\nninth planet in the outer Solar System and by the Galactic gravity causing a\nnon-spherical distribution of gravitational dipoles several kAU from the Sun.\nRadio tracking of the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn yields a ${5\\sigma}$\nupper limit of 160 metres on deviations from its conventionally calculated\ntrajectory. These measurements imply a much more stringent upper limit on\n$\\alpha$ than the minimum required for consistency with rotation curve data.\nTherefore, no value of $\\alpha$ can simultaneously match all available\nconstraints, falsifying the gravitational dipole theory in its current form at\nextremely high significance.",

In order to meet the established\nrequirements and constraints while maintaining a low fuel cost, the use of\nlow-energy trajectories is particularly interesting. These allow spacecraft to\nchange orbits and move with little to no fuel, but they are computed using\nmotion models of a higher fidelity than the commonly used two-body problem\n(2BP). For this purpose, perturbation methods that explore the third-body\neffect are especially attractive, since they can accurately convey the system\ndynamics of a three-body configuration with a lower computational cost, by\nemploying mapping techniques or exploring analytical approximations.\nThe focus of this work is to broaden the knowledge of low-energy trajectories\nby developing new mathematical tools to assist in mission design applications.\nIn particular, novel motion models based on the third-body effect are\nconceived. One application of this study focuses on the trajectory design for\nmissions to near-Earth asteroids. Two different projects are explored: one is\nbased on the preliminary design of separate rendezvous and capture missions to\nthe invariant manifolds of libration point $L_2$. This is achieved by studying\ntwo recently discovered asteroids and determining dates, fuel cost and final\ncontrol history for each trajectory. The other covers a larger study on\nasteroid capture missions, where several bodies are regarded as potential\ntargets. The candidates are considered using a multi-fidelity design framework\nthat filters through the trajectory options using models of motion of\nincreasing accuracy, so that a final refined, low-thrust solution is obtained.\nThe trajectory design hinges on harnessing Earth's gravity by exploiting\nencounters outside its sphere of influence, the named Earth-resonant\nencounters.",
