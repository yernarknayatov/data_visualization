    "abstract": "Abstract:  In-field test of processor-based devices is a must when considering\nsafety-critical systems (e.g., in robotics, aerospace, and automotive\napplications). During in-field testing, different solutions can be adopted,\ndepending on the specific constraints of each scenario. In the last years,\nSelf-Test Libraries (STLs) developed by IP or semiconductor companies became\nwidely adopted. Given the strict constraints of in-field test, the size and\ntime duration of a STL is a crucial parameter. This work introduces a novel\napproach to compress functional test programs belonging to an STL. The proposed\napproach is based on analyzing (via logic simulation) the interaction between\nthe micro-architectural operation performed by each instruction and its\ncapacity to propagate fault effects on any observable output, reducing the\nrequired fault simulations to only one. The proposed compaction strategy was\nvalidated by resorting to a RISC-V processor and several test programs stemming\nfrom diverse generation strategies. Results showed that the proposed compaction\napproach can reduce the length of test programs by up to 93.9% and their\nduration by up to 95%, with minimal effect on fault coverage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Active structures have the ability to change their shape, properties, and\nfunctionality as a response to changing operational conditions, which makes\nthem more versatile than their static counterparts. However, most active\nstructures currently lack the capability to achieve multiple, different target\nstates with a single input actuation or require a tedious material programming\nstep. Furthermore, the systematic design and fabrication of active structures\nis still a challenge as many structures are designed by hand in a trial and\nerror process and thus are limited by engineers' knowledge and experience. In\nthis work, a computational design and fabrication framework is proposed to\ngenerate structures with multiple target states for one input actuation that\ndon't require a separate training step. A material dithering scheme based on\nmulti-material 3D printing is combined with locally applied copper coil heating\nelements and sequential heating patterns to control the thermo-mechanical\nproperties of the structures and switch between the different deformation\nmodes. A novel topology optimization approach based on power diagrams is used\nto encode the different target states in the structure while ensuring the\nfabricability of the structures and the compatibility with the drop-in heating\nelements. The versatility of the proposed framework is demonstrated for four\ndifferent example structures from engineering and computer graphics. The\nnumerical and experimental results show that the optimization framework can\nproduce structures that show the desired motion, but experimental accuracy is\nlimited by current fabrication methods. The generality of the proposed method\nmakes it suitable for the development of structures for applications in many\ndifferent fields from aerospace to robotics to animated fabrication in computer\ngraphics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work considers the seven-coefficient polynomials proposed by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to facilitate obtaining a\nnormalized value for three thermodynamic standard-state specific properties of\nideal gases or condenser matters over an interval of temperature. These\nproperties are the heat capacity at constant pressure, the absolute enthalpy\n(sensible enthalpy plus heat contents due to chemical or physical changes), and\nthe entropy. In the open literature, one can find several databases for the\npolynomial coefficients with variation in the number of species included or the\nrange of temperature covered, and this raises a question of whether the choice\nof a database to use has an important impact on these evaluated thermodynamic\nproperties. Addressing this point, we compare and assess three databases for\nthe NASA 7-coefficient polynomials, over a selected range of temperature from\n300 K to 3500 K, and for selected six common gaseous species encountered in\ncombustion or industrial processes, which are molecular oxygen (O2), molecular\nnitrogen (N2), molecular hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2),\nand water vapor (H2O). Our comparisons suggest that despite the difference in\nthe values of coefficients, there is no significant difference in their\npredictions. However, the latest (7th edition) database of Prof. Alexander\nBurcat hosted at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University (ELTE) in Budapest, Hungary\nshowed superior features when contrasted to other two databases (one\naccompanying the simulation package OpenFOAM 6, and another provided by the\nnatural-gas reaction mechanism GRI-MECH 3.0).",

The objective is to use the \"killer\"\nmodes to control the \"target\" modes through a non-linear stabilizing mechanism.\nThe numerical modelling and results are compared to experimental studies\nperformed at the TsAGI T124 tunnel for a swept plate subject to a favorable\npressure gradient flow. A mathematical model for the actuator developed at\nTsAGI was implemented in a linearized Navier Stokes (LNS) solver and used to\nmodel and hence predict \"killer\" mode amplitudes at a measurement plane in the\nexperiment. The LNS analysis shows good agreement with experiment, and the\nresults are used as input for non-linear PSE analysis to predict the effect of\nthese modes on crossflow transition. Whilst the numerical model indicates a\ndelay in transition, experimental results indicated an advance in transition\nrather than delay. This was determined to be due to actuator induced\nunsteadiness arising in the experiment, resulting in the generation of\ntravelling crossflow disturbances which tended to obscure and thus dominate the\nplasma stabilized stationary disturbances.",

By means of numerical simulations based on the\nDirect Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, we investigate the influence of\nthe orientation of the particle and rarefaction on the drag and lift\ncoefficients, in the case of prolate and oblate ellipsoidal particles immersed\nin a uniform ambient flow. This is done by modelling the solid particles using\na cut-cell algorithm embedded within our DSMC solver. In this approach, the\nsurface of the particle is described by its analytical expression and the\nmicroscopic gas-solid interactions are computed exactly using a ray-tracing\ntechnique. The measured drag and lift coefficients are used to extend the\ncorrelations available in the continuum regime to the rarefied regime, focusing\non the transitional and free-molecular regimes. The functional forms for the\ncorrelations for the ellipsoidal particles are chosen as a generalisation from\nthe spherical case. We show that the fits over the data from numerical\nsimulations can be extended to regimes outside the simulated range of $Kn$ by\ntesting the obtained predictive model on values of $Kn$ that where not included\nin the fitting process, allowing to achieve an higher precision when compared\nwith existing predictive models from literature. Finally, we underline the\nimportance of this work in providing new correlations for non-spherical\nparticles that can be used for point-particle Euler-Lagrangian simulations to\naddress the problem of contamination from finite-size particles in high-tech\nmechanical systems.",

Although the\nrelationship between processing and the resulting properties is well known, an\nunderstanding of the specific deformation mechanisms activated across its\napplication temperature range is required to create more mechanistically\naccurate property models. Direct atomic-scale imaging observations with high\nangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy,\ncomplemented by phase-field modeling informed by generalized stacking fault\nsurface calculations using density functional theory, were employed to\nunderstand the shear process of ${\\gamma}''$ and ${\\gamma}'/{\\gamma}''$\nco-precipitates after 1 \\% macroscopic strain at lower temperature (ambient and\n$427 \u00b0C$). Experimentally, intrinsic stacking faults were observed in the\n${\\gamma}''$, whereas the ${\\gamma}'$ was found to exhibit anti-phase\nboundaries or superlattice intrinsic stacking faults. Additionally, the\natomically flat ${\\gamma}'/{\\gamma}''$ interfaces in the co-precipitates were\nfound to exhibit offsets after shearing, which can be used as tracers for the\ndeformation events. Phase-field modeling shows that the developing\nfault-structure is dependent on the direction of the Burgers vector of the $a/2\n\\langle110\\rangle$ matrix dislocation (or dislocation group) due to the lower\ncrystal symmetry of the ${\\gamma''}$ phase. The interplay between ${\\gamma}'$\nand ${\\gamma}''$ phases results in unique deformation pathways of the\nco-precipitate and increases the shear resistance. Consistent with the\nexperimental observations, the simulation results indicate that complex\nshearing mechanisms are active in the low-temperature deformation regime and\nthat multiple $a/2 \\langle110\\rangle$ dislocations of non-parallel Burgers\nvectors may be active on the same slip plane.",

In this context, Bayesian methods have become very popular in\nseveral fields over the last years, in order to obtain parameter inversion,\nmodel selection or uncertainty quantification. Bayesian inference requires the\napproximation of complicated integrals involving (often costly) posterior\ndistributions. Generally, this approximation is obtained by means of Monte\nCarlo (MC) methods. In order to reduce the computational cost of the\ncorresponding technique, surrogate models (also called emulators) are often\nemployed. Another alternative approach is the so-called Approximate Bayesian\nComputation (ABC) scheme. ABC does not require the evaluation of the costly\nmodel but the ability to simulate artificial data according to that model.\nMoreover, in ABC, the choice of a suitable distance between real and artificial\ndata is also required. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where the\nexpensive model is evaluated only in some well-chosen samples. The selection of\nthese nodes is based on the so-called compressed Monte Carlo (CMC) scheme. We\nprovide theoretical results supporting the novel algorithms and give empirical\nevidence of the performance of the proposed method in several numerical\nexperiments.

The tip deflections\nof everted and uneverted beams under transverse cantilever loads are compared\nwith a tip deflection model that was first developed for aerospace\napplications. LDPE and silicone coated nylon beams were tested; everted and\nuneverted beams showed similar tip deflection. The literature model best fit\nthe tip deflection of LDPE tubes with an average tip deflection error of 6 mm,\nwhile the nylon tubes had an average tip deflection error of 16.4 mm. Everted\nbeams of both materials buckled at 83% of the theoretical buckling condition\nwhile straight beams collapsed at 109% of the theoretical buckling condition.\nThe curvature of everted beams was estimated from a tip load and a known\ndisplacement showing relative errors of 14.2% and 17.3% for LDPE and nylon\nbeams respectively. This paper shows a numerical method for determining\ninflated beam deflection. It also provides an iterative method for computing\nstatic tip pose and applied wall forces in a known environment.",

The\nsecurity concerns have become more heightened as the concept of\nelectronic-enabled aircraft and smart airports get refined and implemented\nunderway. In line with the above, this paper undertakes a review of\ncyber-security incidence in the aviation sector over the last 20 years. The\nessence is to understand the common threat actors, their motivations, the type\nof attacks, aviation infrastructure that is commonly attacked and then match\nthese so as to provide insight on the current state of the cyber-security in\nthe aviation sector. The review showed that the industry's threats come mainly\nfrom Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that work in collaboration with\nsome state actors to steal intellectual property and intelligence, in order to\nadvance their domestic aerospace capabilities as well as possibly monitor,\ninfiltrate and subvert other nations' capabilities. The segment of the aviation\nindustry commonly attacked is the Information Technology infrastructure, and\nthe prominent type of attacks is malicious hacking activities that aim at\ngaining unauthorised access using known malicious password cracking techniques\nsuch as Brute force attacks, Dictionary attacks and so on. The review further\nanalysed the different attack surfaces that exist in aviation industry, threat\ndynamics, and use these dynamics to predict future trends of cyberattacks in\nthe industry. The aim is to provide information for the cybersecurity\nprofessionals and aviation stakeholders for proactive actions in protecting\nthese critical infrastructures against cyberincidence for an optimal customer\nservice oriented industry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work is concerned with the numerical simulation of plasma arc\ninteraction with aerospace substrates under conditions akin to lightning strike\nand in particular with the accurate calculation of radiative heat losses. These\nare important because they have a direct effect on the calculation of thermal\nand pressure loads on the substrates, which can lead to material damage under\ncertain conditions. Direct numerical solution of the radiation transport\nequation (RTE) in mesoscale simulations is not viable due to its computational\ncost, so for practical applications reduced models are usually employed. To\nthis end, four approximations for solving the RTE are considered in this work,\nranging from a simple local thermodynamical behaviour consideration, to a more\ncomplex spectral absorption dependent on the arc geometry. Their performance is\ninitially tested on a one-dimensional cylindrical arc, before implementing them\nin a multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics code. Results indicate that\ninclusion of spectral absorption is necessary in order to obtain consistent\nresults. However, the approaches accounting for the arc geometry require\nrepeated solution of the computationally intensive Helmholtz equations, making\nthem prohibitive for multi-dimensional simulations. As an alternative, a method\nusing the net emission coefficient is employed, which provides a balance\nbetween computational efficiency and accuracy, as shown by comparisons against\nexperimental measurements for a plasma arc attaching to an aluminium substrate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) comprises physical as well as software\nsubsystems. Simulation-based approaches are typically used to support design\nand Verification and Validation (V&V) of CPSs in several domains such as:\naerospace, defence, automotive, smart grid and healthcare. Accordingly, many\nsimulation-based tools are available, and this poses huge interoperability\nchallenges. To overcome them, in 2010 the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)\nwas proposed as an open standard to support both Model Exchange (ME) and\nCo-Simulation (CS). Models adhering to such a standard are called Functional\nMock-up Units (FMUs). FMUs play an essential role in defining complex CPSs\nthrough, e.g., the SSP standard. Simulation-based V&V of CPSs typically\nrequires exploring different scenarios (i.e., exogenous CPS input sequences),\nmany of them showing a shared prefix. Accordingly, the simulator state at the\nend of a shared prefix is saved and then restored and used as a start state for\nthe simulation of the next scenario. In this context, an important FMI feature\nis the capability to save and restore the internal FMU state on demand.\nUnfortunately, the implementation of this feature is not mandatory and it is\navailable only within some commercial software. This motivates developing such\na feature for open-source CPS simulation environments. In this paper, we focus\non JModelica, an open-source modelling and simulation environment for CPSs\ndefined in the Modelica language. We describe how we have endowed JModelica\nwith our open-source implementation of the FMI 2.0 functions to save and\nrestore internal states of FMUs for ME. Furthermore, we present results\nevaluating, through 934 benchmark models, correctness and efficiency of our\nextended JModelica. Our results show that simulation-based V&V is, on average,\n22 times faster with our get/set functionality than without it.",

Our approach is online, meaning that the data are\ncollected over time while the system is evolving in closed-loop, and are\ndirectly used to iteratively update the controller. A major benefit of the\nproposed online implementation is therefore the ability of the controller to\nautomatically adjust to changes in the operating mode of the system.

Especially,\nactive learning integrated surrogate modeling has shown remarkable performance\nin computationally demanding engineering systems. However, the existence of\nheterogeneity in underlying systems may adversely affect the performance of\nactive learning. In order to improve the learning efficiency under this regime,\nwe propose the partitioned active learning that seeks the most informative\ndesign points for partitioned Gaussian process modeling of heterogeneous\nsystems. The proposed active learning consists of two systematic subsequent\nsteps: the global searching scheme accelerates the exploration of active\nlearning by investigating the most uncertain design space, and the local\nsearching exploits the circumscribed information induced by the local GP. We\nalso propose Cholesky update driven numerical remedies for our active learning\nto address the computational complexity challenge. The proposed method is\napplied to numerical simulations and two real-world case studies about (i) the\ncost-efficient automatic fuselage shape control in aerospace manufacturing; and\n(ii) the optimal design of tribocorrosion-resistant alloys in materials\nscience. The results show that our approach outperforms benchmark methods with\nrespect to prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.",

Decades of\nscientific exploration and experimentation through planetary landers and rovers\nshowed uncertain and unsatisfactory results to determine the possibility of\nlife on Mars. Consequently, the technological limitation has impeded to perform\nin-situ experimentation and analysis on the surface. Therefore, we require soil\nsamples through Mars sample return vehicles for superior analysis in our\nground-based laboratories or on-orbit analysis aboard International Space\nStation from the aspect of planetary protection policy. Sampling analysis\neither in ground or orbit will report the presence of fundamental constituents\nto harbor life. To effectuate this intent, we have proposed a unique sample\nreturn architecture integrated with large solar Montgolfier. Here, we deploy\nparachute and retro propulsion thrusters to deliver sample return vehicles on\nto the surface and systematic ascend with the aid of solar Montgolfier to\npropel the MSRV out of Mars atmosphere. Subsequently, the MSRV effectuates\norbital rendezvous with orbiter for the refueling process and safe return. The\nproposed concept is cheap, robust and simple as compared to the current state\nof MSR architectures ultimately minimizing the technological necessities. It\nalso detains backup plans that were found to be nowhere presented in any of\nsample return strategies.

Despite abundant reports on\nthe ex-situ thermal conductivity measurement of stagnant fluids, a suitable\ntechnique for the thermal conductivity measurement of flowing fluid has been\nrarely reported. This paper presents the thermal conductivity measurement of\nflowing fluid within a pipe using a non-contact modulated photothermal\nradiometry (MPR) technique, where the surface of the pipe is heated by an\nintensity-modulated laser and the heat diffuses into the fluid with suitable\nmodulation frequency. We design a tube section with small wall thickness\nsuitable for the MPR measurements to maximize the sensitivity of the thermal\nresponse to the fluid properties while minimizing the lateral heat spreading\neffect. Intrinsic thermal conductivity of different fluids was obtained within\na proper range of frequency and flow velocity where the forced convection\neffect is negligible. The forced convection effect became prominent at high\nflowing velocity and at low modulation frequency, leading to overestimated\nthermal conductivity of fluid. It is found that the intrinsic thermal\nconductivity could be obtained when the flow velocity is less than 100 mm/sec\nand ReD1/2Pr1/3 < 100 for DI water and Xceltherm oil under the specified\nexperimental conditions, where Re_D is the Reynolds number and Pr is the\nPrandtl number.",

The launch was carried out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome by a Proton-M\nrocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on\nSRG under an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace\nAgency. In December 2019, SRG started to perform its main scientific task:\nscanning the celestial sphere to obtain X-ray maps of the entire sky in several\nenergy ranges (from 0.2 to 8 keV with eROSITA, and from 4 to 30 keV with\nART-XC). By mid-June 2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been\ncompleted. Over a period of four years, it is planned to obtain eight\nindependent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of\nthese maps will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million\nquasars and over one hundred thousand massive galaxy clusters and galaxy\ngroups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term\nvariability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic\nX-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. The\nrotation of the satellite around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period\nof four hours enables tracking the faster variability of bright X-ray sources\nduring one day every half year. The chosen strategy of scanning the sky leads\nto the formation of deep survey zones near both ecliptic poles. The paper\npresents sky maps obtained by the telescopes on board SRG during the first\nsurvey of the entire sky and a number of results of deep observations performed\nduring the flight to the L2 point in the frame of the performance verification\nprogram.(Abriged)",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A concept of drone launched short range rockets (DLSRR) is presented. A drone\nor an aircraft rises DLSRR to a release altitude of up to 20 $km$. At the\nrelease altitude, the drone or an aircraft is moving at a velocity of up to 700\n$m/s$ and a steep angle of up to 68$^o$ to the horizontal. After DLSRRs are\nreleased, their motors start firing. DLSRRs use slow burning motors to gain\naltitude and velocity. At the apogee of their flight DLSRRs release projectiles\nwhich fly to the target and strike it at high impact velocity.

We show that a rocket launched at high altitude and high initial\nvelocity does not need expensive thermal protection to survive ascent. Delivery\nof munitions to target by DLSRRs should be much less expensive than delivery by\na conventional rocket. %% Even though delivery of munitions by bomber aircraft\nis even less expensive, a bomber needs to fly close to the target, while a\nDLSRR carrier releases the rockets from a distance of at least 200 $km$ from\nthe target. %% All parameters of DLSRRs, and their trajectories are calculated\nbased on theoretical (mechanical and thermodynamical) analysis and on several\nMatLab programs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For manufacturing of aerospace composites, several parts may be processed\nsimultaneously using convective heating in an autoclave. Due to uncertainties\nincluding tool placement, convective Boundary Conditions (BCs) vary in each\nrun. As a result, temperature histories in some of the parts may not conform to\nprocess specifications due to under-curing or over-heating. Thermochemical\nanalysis using Finite Element (FE) simulations are typically conducted prior to\nfabrication based on assumed range of BCs. This, however, introduces\nunnecessary constraints on the design. To monitor the process, thermocouples\n(TCs) are placed under tools near critical locations. The TC data may be used\nto back-calculate BCs using trial-and-error FE analysis. However, since the\ninverse heat transfer problem is ill-posed, many solutions are obtained for\ngiven TC data. In this study, a novel machine learning (ML) framework is\npresented capable of optimizing air temperature cycle in real-time based on TC\ndata from multiple parts, for active control of manufacturing. The framework\nconsists of two recurrent Neural Networks (NN) for inverse modeling of the\nill-posed curing problem at the speed of 300 simulations/second, and a\nclassification NN for multi-objective optimization of the air temperature at\nthe speed of 35,000 simulations/second. A virtual demonstration of the\nframework for process optimization of three composite parts with data from\nthree TCs is presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  An idealized 1:2 scale demonstrator and a numerical parameter optimization\nalgorithm are proposed to closely reproduce the deformation shape and, thus,\nspatial strain directions of a real aerodynamically loaded civil aircraft\nspoiler using only four concentrated loads. Cost-efficient experimental studies\non demonstrators of increasing complexity are required to transfer knowledge\nfrom coupons to full-scale structures and to build up confidence in novel\nstructural health monitoring (SHM) technologies. Especially for testing novel\nsensor systems that depend on or are affected by mechanical strains, e.g.,\nstrain-based SHM methods, it is essential that the considered lab-scale\nstructures reflect the strain states of the real structure at operational\nloading conditions. Finite element simulations with detailed models were\nperformed for static strength analysis and for comparison to experimental\nmeasurements. The simulated and measured deformations and spatial strain\ndirections of the idealized demonstrator correlated well with the numerical\nresults of the real aircraft spoiler. Thus, using the developed idealized\ndemonstrator, strain-based SHM systems can be tested under conditions that\nreflect operational aerodynamic pressure loads, while the test effort and costs\nare significantly reduced. Furthermore, the presented loading optimization\nalgorithm can be easily adapted to mimic other pressure loads in plate-like\nstructures to reproduce specific structural conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Hayabusa2 is the Japanese Asteroid Return Mission and targeted the\ncarbonaceous asteroid Ryugu, conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA). The goal of this mission was to conduct proximity operations\nincluding remote sensing observations, material sampling, and a Small Carry-On\nImpact experiment, as well as sample analyses. As of September 2020, the\nspacecraft is on the way back to Earth with samples from Ryugu with no critical\nissues after the successful departure in November 2019. Here, we propose an\nextended mission in which the spacecraft will rendezvous with a small asteroid\nwith ~30 m - ~40 m in diameter that is rotating at a spin period of ~10 min\nafter an additional ~10-year cruise phase. We introduce that two scenarios are\nsuitable for the extended mission. In the first scenario, the spacecraft will\nperform swing-by maneuvers at Venus once and Earth twice to arrive at asteroid\n2001 AV43. In the second scenario, it will perform swing-by maneuvers at Earth\ntwice to reach asteroid 1998 KY26. In both scenarios, the mission will continue\nuntil the early 2030s. JAXA recently released the decision that the spacecraft\nwill rendezvous with 1998 KY26. This paper focuses on our scientific\nassessments of the two scenarios but leaves the decision process to go to 1998\nKY26 for future reports. Rendezvous operations will be planned to detail the\nphysical properties and surrounding environments of the target, one of the\nsmallest elements of small planetary bodies. By achieving the planned\noperations, the mission will provide critical hints on the violent histories of\ncollisions and accumulations of small bodies in the solar system. Furthermore,\nthe established scientific knowledge and techniques will advance key\ntechnologies for planetary defense.",

Since the top few centimeters are loosely packed\nregolith, plume impingement from the Lander ejects the granular material at\nhigh velocities. Much work is needed to understand the physics of plume\nimpingement during landing in order to protect hardware surrounding the landing\nsites. While mostly qualitative in nature, the Apollo Lunar Module landing\nvideos can provide a wealth of quantitative information using modern\nphotogrammetry techniques. The authors have used the digitized videos to\nquantify plume impingement effects of the landing exhaust on the lunar surface.\nThe dust ejection angle from the plume is estimated at 1-3 degrees. The lofted\nparticle density is estimated at 10^8 - 10^13 particles/m^3. Additionally,\nevidence for ejection of large 10-15 cm sized objects and a dependence of\nejection angle on thrust are presented.
