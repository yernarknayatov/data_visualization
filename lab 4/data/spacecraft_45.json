    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this paper we analyze the Kerr geometry in the context of Conformal\nGravity, an alternative theory of gravitation, which is a direct extension of\nGeneral Relativity. Following previous studies in the literature, we introduce\nan explicit expression of the Kerr metric in Conformal Gravity, which naturally\nreduces to the standard General Relativity Kerr geometry in the absence of\nConformal Gravity effects. As in the standard case, we show that the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation governing geodesic motion in a space-time based on\nthis geometry is indeed separable and that a fourth constant of motion-similar\nto Carter's constant-can also be introduced in Conformal Gravity. Consequently,\nwe derive the fundamental equations of geodesic motion and show that the\nproblem of solving these equations can be reduced to one of quadratures. In\nparticular, we study the resulting time-like geodesics in Conformal Gravity\nKerr geometry by numerically integrating the equations of motion for Earth\nflyby trajectories of spacecraft. We then compare our results with the existing\ndata of the Flyby Anomaly in order to ascertain whether Conformal Gravity\ncorrections are possibly the origin of this gravitational anomaly. Although\nConformal Gravity slightly affects the trajectories of geodesic motion around a\nrotating spherical object, we show that these corrections are minimal and are\nnot expected to be the origin of the Flyby Anomaly, unless conformal parameters\nare drastically different from current estimates. Therefore, our results\nconfirm previous analyses, showing that modifications due to Conformal Gravity\nare not likely to be detected at the Solar System level, but might affect\ngravity at the galactic or cosmological scale.",

The\nring was discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 24 $\\mu$m and has a\nnormal optical depth of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-8}$ (Verbiscer et al. 2009). We\nreport the first observations of sunlight scattered off the Phoebe ring using\nthe Cassini spacecraft's ISS camera at optical wavelengths. We find that\nmaterial between $\\approx 130-210$ Saturnian radii ($R_S$) from the planet\nproduces an I/F of $1.7 \\pm 0.1 \\times 10^{-11}$ per $R_S$ of the line-of-sight\ndistance through the disk. Combining our measurements with the Spitzer infrared\ndata, we can place constraints on the ring-particles' light-scattering\nproperties.

The continuous flux\nscenario predicts that a significant fraction of the exogenous material\naccreted by Vesta should be due to non-dark impactors likely analogous to\nordinary chondrites, which instead represent only a minor contaminant in the\nHED meteorites. We explored the continuous flux scenario and its implications\nfor the composition of the vestan regolith, taking advantage of the data from\nthe Dawn mission and the HED meteorites. We used our model to show that the\nstochastic events scenario and the micrometeoritic flux scenario are natural\nconsequences of the continuous flux scenario. We then used the model to\nestimate the amounts of dark and hydroxylate materials delivered on Vesta since\nthe LHB and we showed how our results match well with the values estimated by\nthe Dawn mission. We used our model to assess the amount of Fe and siderophile\nelements that the continuous flux of impactors would mix in the vestan\nregolith: concerning the siderophile elements, we focused our attention on the\nrole of Ni. The results are in agreement with the data available on the Fe and\nNi content of the HED meteorites and can be used as a reference frame in future\nstudies of the data from the Dawn mission and of the HED meteorites.

Analytical concepts proceeded\ngradually down to the microscopic scale, the scale of the electron skin depth\nor inertial length, recognizing that current layers that thin do preferentially\nundergo spontaneous reconnection. Thick current layers start reconnecting when\nbeing forced by plasma inflow to thin. For almost half a century the physical\nmechanism of reconnection has remained a mystery. Spacecraft in situ\nobservations in combination with sophisticated numerical simulations in two and\nthree dimensions recently clarified the mist, finding that reconnection\nproduces a specific structure of the current layer inside the electron inertial\n(also called electron diffusion) region around the reconnection site, the X\nline. Onset of reconnection is attributed to pseudo-viscous contributions of\nthe electron pressure tensor aided by electron inertia and drag, creating a\ncomplicated structured electron current sheet, electric fields, and an electron\nexhaust extended along the current layer. We review the general background\ntheory and recent developments in numerical simulation on collisionless\nreconnection. It is impossible to cover the entire field of reconnection in a\nshort space-limited review. The presentation necessarily remains cursory,\ndetermined by our taste, preferences, and knowledge.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Predictive coding is attractive for compression onboard of spacecrafts thanks\nto its low computational complexity, modest memory requirements and the ability\nto accurately control quality on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Traditionally,\npredictive compression focused on the lossless and near-lossless modes of\noperation where the maximum error can be bounded but the rate of the compressed\nimage is variable. Rate control is considered a challenging problem for\npredictive encoders due to the dependencies between quantization and prediction\nin the feedback loop, and the lack of a signal representation that packs the\nsignal's energy into few coefficients. In this paper, we show that it is\npossible to design a rate control scheme intended for onboard implementation.\nIn particular, we propose a general framework to select quantizers in each\nspatial and spectral region of an image so as to achieve the desired target\nrate while minimizing distortion. The rate control algorithm allows to achieve\nlossy, near-lossless compression, and any in-between type of compression, e.g.,\nlossy compression with a near-lossless constraint. While this framework is\nindependent of the specific predictor used, in order to show its performance,\nin this paper we tailor it to the predictor adopted by the CCSDS-123 lossless\ncompression standard, obtaining an extension that allows to perform lossless,\nnear-lossless and lossy compression in a single package. We show that the rate\ncontroller has excellent performance in terms of accuracy in the output rate,\nrate-distortion characteristics and is extremely competitive with respect to\nstate-of-the-art transform coding.",

IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on\n27 June 2013 using a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope\nthat feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging spectrograph. IRIS obtains\nspectra in passbands from 1332-1358, 1389-1407 and 2783-2834 Angstrom including\nbright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg II h 2803 Angstrom and Mg\nII k 2796 Angstrom) and transition region (C II 1334/1335 Angstrom and Si IV\n1394/1403 Angstrom). Slit-jaw images in four different passbands (C II 1330, Si\nIV 1400, Mg II k 2796 and Mg II wing 2830 Angstrom) can be taken simultaneously\nwith spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec x 175 arcsec at a\nvariety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to\nemission from plasma at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance\nour understanding of the flow of mass and energy through an interface region,\nformed by the chromosphere and transition region, between the photosphere and\ncorona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit\nof all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires\nan order of magnitude more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind\ncombined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong numerical modeling component\nbased on advanced radiative-MHD codes to facilitate interpretation of\nobservations of this complex region. Approximately eight Gbytes of data (after\ncompression) are acquired by IRIS each day and made available for unrestricted\nuse within a few days of the observation.",

A magnetosphere more confined to the equator\nin the polar regions is expected as a result of the interaction between this\ntype of obstacle and the solar wind. In addition, at times away from equinox, a\nnorth-south asymmetry is expected where the magnetopause will be further\nconfined in one hemisphere but less confined in the opposite hemisphere.\nExamining the extent of this confinement has been limited by a lack of\nhigh-latitude spacecraft observations. Here, for the first time, direct\nevidence for polar confinement of Saturn's magnetopause has been observed using\nin-situ data obtained by the Cassini spacecraft during a series of\nhigh-inclination orbits between 2007 and 2009. Following techniques established\nby previous authors, we assume an equilibrium between the solar wind dynamic\npressure (which Cassini is generally unable to measure directly), and the\nmagnetic plus plasma pressure inside the magnetosphere. This assumption thus\nallows us to estimate the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure ($D_P$) for a\nseries of magnetopause crossings, and hence to determine the expected location\nand global shape of the magnetopause as a function of $D_P$. A clear divergence\nfrom the familiar axisymmetric models of the magnetosphere is observed which\nmay be characterised by an 'apparent flattening parameter' of 0.81+0.03/-0.06\n(representing a simple dilation of the nominal axisymmetric boundary along the\n$Z_{KSM}$ axis such that the extent is reduced by 19% in this direction). This\nfigure is insensitive to variations in $D_P$.",

But to this day, obtaining the drag\nacting on the complicated shapes of modern spacecraft suffers from many sources\nof error. While part of the problem is the uncertain density in the upper\natmosphere, this works focuses on improving the modeling of interacting\nrarified gases and satellite surfaces. The only numerical approach that\ncurrently captures effects in this flow regime---like self-shadowing and\nmultiple molecular reflections---is known as test-particle Monte Carlo. This\nmethod executes a ray-tracing algorithm to follow particles that pass through a\ncontrol volume containing the spacecraft and accumulates the momentum transfer\nto the body surfaces. Statistical fluctuations inherent in the approach demand\nparticle numbers in the order of millions, often making this scheme too costly\nto be practical. This work presents a parallel test-particle Monte Carlo method\nthat takes advantage of both GPUs and multi-core CPUs. The speed at which this\nmodel can run with millions of particles allowed exploring a regime where a\nflaw in the model's initial particle seeding was revealed. Our new model\nintroduces an analytical fix based on seeding the calculation with an initial\ndistribution of particles at the boundary of a spherical control volume and\ncomputing the integral for the correct number flux. This work includes\nverification of the proposed model using analytical solutions for several\nsimple geometries and demonstrates uses for studying aero-stabilization of the\nPhobos-Grunt Martian probe and pose-estimation for the ICESat mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The determination of an exoplanet as rocky is critical for the assessment of\nplanetary habitability. Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting\nplanets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust\ndetermination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict\nthat rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach\n~10 Earth-masses, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how\ntransit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the\ncritical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal\nmodels predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more\nrapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on\ncircular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled\ntransits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a\nmeasurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect\nshould be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent.\nInstead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any\nplanetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly\nthe impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the\ntransit duration toward values that are smaller than that of planets on\ncircular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines\nthe transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to\ndetermine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal\ndissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal\nmodels.",

At\nthat time both Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft were\nlocated more than 90 degrees from Earth and could observe the CME eruption\ndirectly, with the CME visible on-disk from STEREO-B and off the limb from\nSTEREO-A. Signatures of pressure variations in the corona such as deflected\nstreamers were seen, indicating the presence of a coronal shock associated with\nthis CME eruption. The evolution of the CME and an associated EUV wave were\nstudied using EUV and coronagraph images. It was found that the lateral\nexpansion of the CME low in the corona closely tracked the propagation of the\nEUV wave, with measured velocities of 240+/-19 km/s and 221+/-15 km/s for the\nCME and wave respectively. Solar energetic particles were observed arriving\nfirst at STEREO-A, followed by electrons at the Wind spacecraft at L1, then\nSTEREO-B, and finally protons arriving simultaneously at Wind and STEREO-B. By\ncarrying out velocity-dispersion analysis on the particles arriving at each\nlocation, it was found that energetic particles arriving at STEREO-A were\nreleased first and the release of particles arriving at STEREO-B was delayed by\naround 50 minutes. Analysis of the expansion of the CME to a wider longitude\nindicates that this delay is a result of the time taken for the edge of the CME\nto reach the footpoints of the magnetic-field lines connected to STEREO-B. The\nCME expansion is not seen to reach the magnetic footpoint of Wind at the time\nof solar particle release for the particles detected here, suggesting that\nthese particles may not be associated with this CME.",

The C Ring shows a minimum particle size\nof $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a\nmaximum particle size of 10 m.\nThe A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is\ncomplicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths. If\nq<3, our A Ring model requires a minimum particle size below one millimeter (<\n0.34 mm for an assumed q=2.75, or $0.56^{+0.35}_{-0.16}$ mm for a steeper\nq=2.9) to be consistent with VIMS observations. These results might seem to\ncontradict previous optical(Dones et al., 1993) and infrared (French and\nNicholson, 2000) work, which implied that there were few particles in the A\nRing smaller than 1 cm. But, because of the shallow power law, relatively\nlittle optical depth (between 0.03 and 0.16 in extinction, or 0.015 - 0.08 in\nabsorption) is provided by these particles.",

We develop a list of effective radii and their uncertainties for 161\nactive JFCs and compute the observed size-frequency distribution using a\nProbability Index technique. The radii range from 0.2 to 15.4 km. This is then\ncorrected for the effects of observational selection using a model published\nearlier by Meech et al.(2004). We estimate that the total number of active JFCs\nbetween 0.2 and 15.4 km is approximately 2300.The active JFC size-frequency\ndistribution, over the range from 0.6 to 10 km where it is best defined, is\nfound to be closer to an exponential distribution in character than a\npower-law. We then develop a statistical model, based on the assumption of a\nsteady state, for converting the distribution of active JFCs to the SFD of the\nsource population among the TNOs. The model includes the effects of\ndevolatization (that produces a large sub-class of defunct nuclei) and\nsurficial mass-loss. Comparison with available TNO observations shows that to\nsimultaneously attain continuity with the data on objects in the hot TNO\npopulation (Fuentes et al,2010), satisfy constraints on the number of TNOs set\nby the occultation detections of Schlichting et al.(2012), and to remain within\nupper limits set by the Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS; Zhang et\nal,2013) the total JFC population must contain a large fraction of small\ndefunct nuclei. The effective power-law index of the inferred TNO differential\nSFD between 1 and 10 km is -4.5 +/- 0.5 indicating a population in this range\nthat is not in fully relaxed collisional equilibrium.

Our aim was to analyse imaging and spectroscopy from multiple\ndifferent sources using a single self-consistent radiative-transfer model to\nassess the magnitude of seasonal variability. Globally-averaged stratospheric\ntemperatures measured from methane emission tend towards a quasi-isothermal\nstructure (158-164 K) above the 0.1-mbar level, and are found to be consistent\nwith spacecraft observations of AKARI.

Conversely, ethane emission is highly variable, with\nabundance determinations varying by more than a factor of two. The retrieved\nC2H6 abundances are extremely sensitive to the details of the T(p) derivation.\nStratospheric temperatures and ethane are found to be latitudinally uniform\naway from the south pole (assuming a latitudinally-uniform distribution of\nstratospheric methane). At low and midlatitudes, comparisons of synthetic\nVoyager-era images with solstice-era observations suggest that tropospheric\nzonal temperatures are unchanged since the Voyager 2 encounter, with cool\nmid-latitudes and a warm equator and pole. A re-analysis of Voyager/IRIS 25-50\n{\\mu}m mapping of tropospheric temperatures and para-hydrogen disequilibrium\nsuggests a symmetric meridional circulation with cold air rising at\nmid-latitudes (sub-equilibrium para-H2 conditions) and warm air sinking at the\nequator and poles (super-equilibrium para-H2 conditions).

Actually, it\nseems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as $0.5$\nmm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just $\\dot\\Omega_{\\rm\nLT}=2$ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr$^{-1}$). Some tesseral and sectorial\nocean tides such as $K_1,K_2$ induce long-period harmonic node perturbations\nwith frequencies which are integer multiples of the extremely slow Galileo's\nnode rate $\\dot\\Omega$ completing a full cycle in about 40 yr. Thus, over time\nspans $T$ of some years they would act as superimposed semi-secular aliasing\ntrends. Since the coefficients of the $J_{\\ell}$-free multisatellite linear\ncombinations are determined only by the semimajor axis $a$, the eccentricity\n$e$ and the inclination $I$, which are nominally equal for all the Galileo\nsatellites, it is not possible to include all of them. Even by using only one\nGalileo spacecraft together with the LAGEOS family would be unfeasible because\nthe resulting Galileo coefficient would be $\\gtrsim 1$, thus enhancing the\naliasing impact of the uncancelled non-conservative and tidal perturbations.",

It appeared\nas a linear drift in the Doppler data received by the spacecraft, which has\nbeen ascribed to an approximately constant sunward acceleration of about $8.5\n\\times 10^{-13} km/s^2$. Since then, the existence of the anomaly has been\nconfirmed independently by several groups and a large effort was devoted to\nfind its origin. The present study consists of two main parts: thermal modeling\nof the spacecraft throughout its trajectory, and orbit determination analysis.\nBased on existing documentation and published telemetry data we built a thermal\nfinite element model of the spacecraft, whose complexity has been constrained\nto a degree allowing for sensitivity analysis, leading to the computation of\nits formal uncertainty. The trajectory analysis and orbit determination was\ncarried out using NASA/JPL's ODP (Orbit Determination Program) and our results\nshow that orbital solutions may be achieved that do not require the addition of\nany \"unknown\" acceleration other than the one of thermal origin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We study physical consequences of the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP)\nfor a Hubble observer in FLRW universe. We introduce the local inertial\ncoordinates with the help of a special conformal transformation. The local\ninertial metric is Minkowski-flat and materialized by a congruence of time-like\ngeodesics of static observers. The static observers are equipped with the ideal\nclocks measuring the proper time that is synchronized with the clocks of the\nHubble observer. The local inertial metric is used for physical measurements of\nspacetime intervals with the ideal clocks and rulers. The special conformal\ntransformation preserves null geodesics but does not keep invariant time-like\ngeodesics. Moreover, it makes the rate of the local time coordinate dependent\non velocity of the particle which makes impossible to rich the uniform\nparameterization of the world lines of static observers and light geodesics\nwith a single parameter - they differ by the conformal factor of FLRW metric.\nIt tells us that the metric on the light cone is not Minkowski-flat but depends\non the scale factor of FLRW universe and it can be interpreted as a weak\nviolation of EEP for photons. The importance of this violation for\ngravitational physics is that some of local experiments conducted with\nfreely-propagating electromagnetic waves may be sensitive to the Hubble\nexpansion. We show that the Hubble constant H can be measured within the solar\nsystem by means of high-precision spacecraft Doppler tracking as a blue shift\nof frequency of radio waves circulating in the Earth-spacecraft radio link. We\nalso analyze the behavior of the standing wave in a microwave resonator and\nshow that the standing wave is insensitive to the Hubble expansion.",

When compiled with\nother observations of the dominant volatiles of Garradd, unexpected behavior\nwas seen in the release of CO. The H2O outgassing of Garradd, increasing and\npeaking pre-perihelion and then steadily decreasing, is more typical than that\nof CO, which monotonically increased throughout the entire apparition. Due to\nthe temporal asymmetry in volatile release, Garradd exhibited the highest CO to\nH2O abundance ratio ever observed for any comet inside the water snow line at\n60 percent during the HRI-IR observations. Also, the HRI-IR made the only\ndirect measurement of CO2, giving a typical cometary abundance ratio of CO2 to\nH2O of 8 percent but, with only one measurement, no sense of how it varied with\norbital position.",

Then the expression of the\ngravity gradient torque in terms of gravitational potential derivatives is\nderived. By using the formulation of the gravitational potential, explicit\nformulations of the full fourth-order gravity gradient torque are obtained.\nThen a numerical simulation is carried out to verify our model. Findings: We\nfind that our model is more sound and precise than the previous fourth-order\nmodel due to the consideration of higher-order inertia integrals of the\nspacecraft. Numerical simulation results show that the motion of the previous\nfourth-order model is quite different from the exact motion, while our full\nfourth-order model fits the exact motion very well. Our full fourth-order model\nis precise enough for high-precision attitude dynamics and control around\nasteroids. Practical implications: This high-precision model is of importance\nfor the future asteroids missions for scientific explorations and near-Earth\nobjects mitigation. Originality and value: In comparison with the previous\nmodel, a gravity gradient torque model around asteroids that is more sound and\nprecise is established. This model is valuable for high-precision attitude\ndynamics and control around asteroids.",

Instead, the close approach of big\nplanets to the line of sight of the reference quasars could be also used for\ntesting of the general relativity theory with VLBI. Jupiter is the most\nappropriate among the big planets due to its large mass and relatively fast\napparent motion across the celestial sphere. Six close approaches of Jupiter\nwith quasars in 2014-2016 were found using the DE405/LE405 ephemerides,\nincluding one occultation in 2016.

The CMEs were tracked continuously from the Sun\nto near Earth in multi-viewpoint imaging data from STEREO SECCHI and SOHO\nLASCO. We use the Graduate Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model to estimate the\nthree-dimensional direction and height of the CMEs in every image out to\n$\\sim$200 R$_\\odot$. We fit the derived three-dimensional (deprojected) height\nand time data with six different methods to extrapolate the CME ToA and\nvelocity at Earth. We compare the fitting results with the in situ data from\nthe WIND spacecraft. We find that a simple linear fit after a height of\n50$R_\\odot$ gives the best ToA with a total error $\\pm$13 hours. For seven\n(78%) of the CMEs, we are able to predict the ToA to within $\\pm$6 hours. These\nresults are a full day improvement over past CME arrival time methods that only\nused SOHO LASCO data. We conclude that heliographic measurements, beyond the\ncoronagraphic field of view, of the CME front made away from the Sun-Earth line\nare essential for accurate predictions of their time of arrival.",
