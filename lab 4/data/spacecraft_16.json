    "abstract": "Abstract:  During the Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) first perihelion pass, the spacecraft\nreached within a heliocentric distance of \\(\\sim 37~R_\\odot\\) and observed\nnumerous magnetic and flow structures characterized by sharp gradients. To\nbetter understand these intermittent structures in the young solar wind, an\nimportant property to examine is their degree of correlation in time and space.\nTo this end, we use the well-tested Partial Variance of Increments (PVI)\ntechnique to identify intermittent events in FIELDS and SWEAP observations of\nmagnetic and proton-velocity fields (respectively) during PSP's first solar\nencounter, when the spacecraft was within 0.25 au from the Sun. We then examine\ndistributions of waiting times between events with varying separation and PVI\nthresholds. We find power-law distributions for waiting times shorter than a\ncharacteristic scale comparable to the correlation time, suggesting a high\ndegree of correlation that may originate in a clustering process. Waiting times\nlonger than this characteristic time are better described by an exponential,\nsuggesting a random memory-less Poisson process at play. These findings are\nconsistent with near-Earth observations of solar wind turbulence. The present\nstudy complements the one by Dudok de Wit et al. (2020, present volume), which\nfocuses on waiting times between observed \"switchbacks\" in the radial magnetic\nfield.",

The main\narchitecture of INFROS involves using the near-Sun flux rope properties\nobtained from the observational parameters that are evolved through the model\nin order to estimate the magnetic field vectors of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs)\nat any heliocentric distance. We have formulated a new approach in INFROS to\nincorporate the expanding nature and the time-varying axial magnetic\nfield-strength of the flux rope during its passage over the spacecraft. As a\nproof of concept, we present the case study of an Earth-impacting CME which\noccurred on 2013 April 11. Using the near-Sun properties of the CME flux rope,\nwe have estimated the magnetic vectors of the ICME as intersected by the\nspacecraft at 1 AU. The predicted magnetic field profiles of the ICME show good\nagreement with those observed by the in-situ spacecraft. Importantly, the\nmaximum strength (10.5 $\\pm$ 2.5 nT) of the southward component of the magnetic\nfield (Bz) obtained from the model prediction, is in agreement with the\nobserved value (11 nT). Although our model does not include the prediction of\nthe ICME plasma parameters, as a first order approximation it shows promising\nresults in forecasting of Bz in near real time which is critical for predicting\nthe severity of the associated geomagnetic storms. This could prove to be a\nsimple space-weather forecasting tool compared to the time-consuming and\ncomputationally expensive MHD models.",

Temporal association between particle\nincreases and small brightness surges in the extreme-ultraviolet observed by\nthe Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, which were also accompanied by\ntype III radio emission seen by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation on\nPSP, indicates that the source of this event was an active region nearly 80\ndegrees east of the nominal PSP magnetic footpoint.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Heat transport in the solar corona and wind is still a major unsolved\nastrophysical problem. Because of the key role played by electrons, the\nelectron density and temperature(s) are important prerequisites for\nunderstanding these plasmas. We present such in situ measurements along the two\nfirst solar encounters of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), between 0.5 and 0.17 AU\nfrom the Sun, revealing different states of the emerging solar wind near solar\nactivity minimum. These preliminary results are obtained from a simplified\nanalysis of the plasma quasi-thermal noise (QTN) spectrum measured by the Radio\nFrequency Spectrometer (RFS/FIELDS). The local electron density is deduced from\nthe tracking of the plasma line, which enables accurate measurements,\nindependent of calibrations and spacecraft perturbations, whereas the\ntemperatures of the thermal and supra-thermal components of the velocity\ndistribution, as well as the average kinetic temperature are deduced from the\nshape of the plasma line. The temperature of the weakly collisional thermal\npopulation, similar for both encounters, decreases with distance as\n$R^{-0.74}$, much slower than adiabatic. In contrast, the temperature of the\nnearly collisionless suprathermal population exhibits a virtually flat radial\nvariation. The 7-second resolution of the density measurements enables us to\ndeduce the low-frequency spectrum of compressive fluctuations around\nperihelion, varying as $f^{-1.4}$. This is the first time that QTN spectroscopy\nis implemented with an electric antenna length not exceeding the plasma Debye\nlength. As PSP will approach the Sun, the decrease in Debye length is expected\nto considerably improve the accuracy of the temperature measurements.",

Observations of coherent\nelectromagnetic waves at ion scales suggests that linear cyclotron resonance\nand non-linear processes are dynamically relevant in the inner heliosphere. A\nwavelet-based statistical study of coherent waves in the first perihelion\nencounter of PSP demonstrates the presence of transverse electromagnetic waves\nat ion resonant scales which are observed in 30-50\\% of radial field intervals.\nAverage wave amplitudes of approximately 4 nT are measured, while the mean\nduration of wave events is of order 20 seconds; however long duration wave\nevents can exist without interruption on hour-long timescales. Though ion scale\nwaves are preferentially observed during intervals with a radial mean magnetic\nfield, we show that measurement constraints, associated with single spacecraft\nsampling of quasi-parallel waves superposed with anisotropic turbulence, render\nthe measured quasi-parallel ion-wave spectrum unobservable when the mean\nmagnetic field is oblique to the solar wind flow; these results imply that the\noccurrence of coherent ion-scale waves is not limited to a radial field\nconfiguration. The lack of strong radial scaling of characteristic wave\namplitudes and duration suggests that the waves are generated {\\em{in-situ}}\nthrough plasma instabilities.

Here we present the kinetic model\ncoupled with the globalMHD model for the Solar Corona (SC) and Inner\nHeliosphere (IH), which was described in the first paper in the series. At the\nheart of the coupled model is a self-consistent treatment of the Alfven wave\nturbulence. The turbulence not only heats corona, powers and accelerates the\nsolar wind, but also serves as the main agent to scatter the SEPs and thus\ncontrols their acceleration and transport. The universal character of the\nturbulence in the coupled model provides a realistic description of the SEP\ntransport by using the level of turbulence as validated with the solar wind and\ncoronal plasma observations. At the same time, the SEP observations at 1 AU can\nbe used to validate the model for turbulence in the IH, since the observed SEPs\nhave witnessed this turbulence on their way through the IH.",

The policy maps flash LIDAR measurements directly to on/off\nspacecraft body-frame thrust commands, allowing hovering at a fixed position\nand attitude in the asteroid body-fixed reference frame. Importantly, the\npolicy does not require position and velocity estimates, and can operate in\nenvironments with unknown dynamics, and without an asteroid shape model or\nnavigation aids. Indeed, during optimization the agent is confronted with a new\nrandomly generated asteroid for each episode, insuring that it does not learn\nan asteroid's shape, texture, or environmental dynamics. This allows the\ndeployed policy to generalize well to novel asteroid characteristics, which we\ndemonstrate in our experiments. Moreover, our experiments show that the\noptimized policy adapts to actuator failure and sensor noise. Although the\npolicy is optimized using randomly generated synthetic asteroids, it is tested\non two shape models from actual asteroids: Bennu and Itokawa. We find that the\npolicy generalizes well to these shape models. The hovering controller has the\npotential to simplify mission planning by allowing asteroid body-fixed hovering\nimmediately upon the spacecraft's arrival to an asteroid. This in turn\nsimplifies shape model generation and allows resource mapping via remote\nsensing immediately upon arrival at the target asteroid.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Metis is the first solar coronagraph designed for a space mission capable of\nperforming simultaneous imaging of the off-limb solar corona in both visible\nand UV light. The observations obtained with Metis aboard the Solar Orbiter\nESA-NASA observatory will enable us to diagnose, with unprecedented temporal\ncoverage and spatial resolution, the structures and dynamics of the full corona\nfrom 1.7 $R_\\odot$ to about 9 $R_\\odot$. Due to the uniqueness of the Solar\nOrbiter mission profile, Metis will be able to observe the solar corona from a\nclose vantage point (down to 0.28 AU), achieving out-of-ecliptic views with the\nincrease of the orbit inclination over time. Moreover, observations near\nperihelion, during the phase of lower rotational velocity of the solar surface\nrelative to the spacecraft, will allow longer-term studies of the coronal\nfeatures. Thanks to a novel occultation design and a combination of a UV\ninterference coating of the mirrors and a spectral bandpass filter, Metis\nimages the solar corona simultaneously in the visible light band, between 580\nand 640 nm, and in the UV H I Lyman-{\\alpha} line at 121.6 nm. The coronal\nimages in both the UV Lyman-{\\alpha} and polarised visible light are obtained\nat high spatial resolution with a spatial scale down to about 2000 km and 15000\nkm at perihelion, in the cases of the visible and UV light, respectively. A\ntemporal resolution down to 1 second can be achieved when observing coronal\nfluctuations in visible light. The Metis measurements will allow for complete\ncharacterisation of the main physical parameters and dynamics of the electron\nand neutral hydrogen/proton plasma components of the corona in the region where\nthe solar wind undergoes acceleration and where the onset and initial\npropagation of coronal mass ejections take place, thus significantly improving\nour understanding of the region connecting the Sun to the heliosphere.",

First, the determination of daily Earth orientation parameters (UT0\nand variation of latitude), which is rarely used nowadays in presence of\nall-year VLBI, SLR, and GNSS data. The second application is the determination\nof two (out of three) lunar orientation parameters, i.e. daily corrections to\nthe rotational ephemeris of the Moon. It may be of importance for the future\nlunar satellite-based navigational systems. The third application is the tie of\nephemeris frame (BCRF) to the ICRF. It has been studied before, though in this\nwork it is extensively compared to another realization of the same tie,\nobtained by spacecraft VLBI observations; also, two different EOP series and\ntwo different models of tidal variations of geopotential are applied, with\ndifferent outcomes on the tie.\nThe EPM lunar-planetary ephemeris, along with its underlying dynamical model\nand software, was used to obtain the presented results. All available\nobservations were processed, since the earliest made at the end of 1969 at the\nMcDonald observatory till the end of July 2019 (Matera, Grasse and also\nWettzell observatory which began to provide data in 2018).

The CPC erupted first with its low and very faint coronal\nsignature. Later, above the CPC, a diffuse and thin flux rope also developed\nand erupted. The spreading CPC further triggered a rotating jet-like structure\nfrom the coronal hole lying to its northward end. This jet-like eruption may\nhave evolved due to the interaction between spreading CPC and the open field\nlines of the coronal hole lying towards its northward foot-point. The CPC\nconnected two small trans-equatorial coronal holes lying respectively in the\nnorthern and southern hemisphere on either side of the Equator. These eruptions\nwere collectively associated with the stealth-type CMEs and CME associated with\na jet-like eruption. The source region of the stealth CMEs lay between two\ncoronal holes connected by a coronal plasma channel. Another CME was also\nassociated with a jet-like eruption that occurred from the coronal hole in the\nnorthern hemisphere. These CMEs evolved without any low coronal signature and\nyet were responsible for the third strongest geomagnetic storm of Solar cycle\n24. These stealth CMEs further merged and collectively passed through the\ninterplanetary space. The compound CME further produced an intense geomagnetic\nstorm (GMS) with Dst index= -176 nT. The $z$-component of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field [$B_{z}$] switched to negative (-18 nT) during this interaction,\nand simultaneous measurement of the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field\n(Kp=7) indicates the onset of the geomagnetic storm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic clouds (MCs), as large-scale interplanetary magnetic flux ropes, are\nusually still connected to the sun at both ends near 1 AU. Many researchers\nbelieve that all non-MC interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) also have\nmagnetic flux rope structures, which are inconspicuous because the observing\nspacecraft crosses the flanks of the rope structures. If so, the field lines of\nnon-MC ICMEs should also be usually connected to the Sun on both ends. Then we\nwant to know whether the field lines of most non-MC ICMEs are still connected\nto the sun at both ends or not. This study examined the counterstreaming\nsuprathermal electron (CSE) signatures of 266 ICMEs observed by the\n\\emph{Advanced Composition Explorer} (\\emph{ACE}) spacecraft from 1998 to 2008\nand compared the CSE signatures of MCs and non-MC ICMEs. Results show that only\n10 of the 101 MC events ($9.9\\%$ ) and 75 of the 171 non-MC events ($43.9\\%$)\nhave no CSEs. Moreover, 21 of the non-MC ICMEs have high CSE percentages (more\nthan $70\\%$) and show relatively stable magnetic field components with slight\nrotations, which are in line with the expectations that spacecraft passes\nthrough the flank of magnetic flux ropes. So the 21 events may be magnetic flux\nropes but the \\emph{ACE} spacecraft passes through their flanks of magnetic\nflux ropes. Considering that most other non-MC events have disordered magnetic\nfields, we suggest that some non-MC ICMEs inherently have disordered magnetic\nfields, namely have no magnetic flux rope structures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Particle Telescope (PATE) of FORESAIL-1 mission is described. FORESAIL-1\nis a CubeSat mission to polar Low Earth Orbit. Its scientific objectives are to\ncharacterize electron precipitation from the radiation belts and to observe\nenergetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating from the Sun during the strongest\nsolar flares. For that purpose, the 3-unit CubeSat carries a particle telescope\nthat measures energetic electrons in the nominal energy range of 80--800 keV in\nseven energy channels and energetic protons at 0.3--10 MeV in ten channels. In\naddition, particles penetrating the whole telescope at higher energies will be\nmeasured in three channels: one $>$800 keV electron channel, two integral\nproton channels at $>$10 MeV energies. The instrument contains two telescopes\nat right angles to each other, one measuring along the spin axis of the\nspacecraft and one perpendicular to it. During a spin period (nominally 15 s),\nthe rotating telescope will, thus, deliver angular distributions of protons and\nelectrons, at 11.25-degree clock-angle resolution, which enables one to\naccurately determine the pitch-angle distribution and separate the trapped and\nprecipitating particles. During the last part of the mission, the rotation axis\nwill be accurately pointed toward the Sun, enabling the measurement of the\nenergetic hydrogen from that direction. Using the geomagnetic field as a filter\nand comparing the rates observed by the two telescopes, the instrument can\nobserve the solar ENA flux for events similar to the only one so far observed\nin December 2006. We present the Geant4-simulated energy and angular response\nfunctions of the telescope and assess its sensitivity showing that they are\nadequate to address the scientific objectives of the mission.",

To examine the statistical relationship\nbetween type II bursts and SEPs, we selected 26 coronal mass ejection (CME)\nevents with similar characteristics (e.g., initial speed, angular width, and\nlocation) observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO),\nregardless of the characteristics of the corresponding type II bursts and the\nSEP flux. Then, we compared associated type II bursts observed by the Radio and\nPlasma Wave Experiment (WAVES) onboard the Wind spacecraft and the SEP flux\nobserved by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)\norbiting around the Earth. We found that the bandwidth of the hectometric type\nII bursts and the peak flux of the SEPs has a positive correlation (with a\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.64). This result supports the idea that the\nnonthermal electrons of type II bursts and the nonthermal ions of SEPs are\ngenerated by the same shock and suggests that more SEPs may be generated for a\nwider or stronger CME shock with a longer duration. Our result also suggests\nthat considering the spectral structures of type II bursts can improve the\nforecasting accuracy for the peak flux of gradual SEPs.",

In this work\nwe investigate the potentialities of the datasets provided by the most\npromising past, present and future interplanetary missions to draw a realistic\npicture of the knowledge that can be reached in the next 10-15 years. To this\naim, we update the semi-analytical model originally developed for the\nBepiColombo mission, to take into account planet-planet relativistic\ninteractions and eccentricity-induced effects and validate it against\nwell-established numerical models to assess the precision of the retrieval of\nthe parameters of interest. Before the analysis of the results we give a review\nof some of the hypotheses and constrained analysis schemes that have been\nproposed until now to overcome geometrical weaknessess and model degeneracies,\nproving that these strategies introduce model inconsistencies. Finally we apply\nour semi-analytical model to perform a covariance analysis on three samples of\ninterplanetary missions: 1) those for which data are available now (e.g.\nCassini, MESSENGER, MRO, Juno), 2) in the next years (BepiColombo) and 3) still\nto be launched as JUICE and VERITAS (this latter is waiting for the approval).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Moist convective storms in Jupiter develop frequently and can trigger\natmospheric activity of different scales, from localized storms to\nplanetary-scale disturbances including convective activity confined inside a\nlarger meteorological system. In February 2018 a series of convective storms\nerupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from\n-23$^{\\circ}$ to -29.5$^{\\circ}$). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic\nregion known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval\nBA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The\ninitial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring\nturbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of\nclouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent\nactivity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them\nclosely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west.\nHere we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily\nobservations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations\nobtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space\nTelescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical\nsimulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the\nphenomenology observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay\nbetween the Ghost, the convective eruptions and Oval BA, and they demonstrate\nthat water moist convection was the source of the initial storms. A simple\nscale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the\nplanet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that\nmost of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are among the most magnificent solar\neruptions, are a major driver of space weather and can thus affect diverse\nhuman technologies. Different processes have been proposed to explain the\ninitiation and release of CMEs from solar active regions (ARs), without\nreaching consensus on which is the predominant scenario, and thus rendering\nimpossible to accurately predict when a CME is going to erupt from a given AR.\nTo investigate AR magnetic properties that favor CMEs production, we employ\nmulti-spacecraft data to analyze a long duration AR (NOAA 11089, 11100, 11106,\n11112 and 11121) throughout its complete lifetime, spanning five Carrington\nrotations from July to November 2010. We use data from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory to study the evolution of the AR magnetic properties during the\nfive near-side passages, and a proxy to follow the magnetic flux changes when\nno magnetograms are available, i.e. during far-side transits. We characterized\nthe angular widths, speeds and masses of 108 CMEs that we associated to the AR,\nwhen examining a 124-day period. Such an ejectivity tracking was possible\nthanks to the multiviewpoint images provided by the STEREO and SOHO in a\nquasiquadrature configuration. We also inspected the X-ray flares registered by\nthe GOES satellite and found 162 to be associated to the AR under study. Given\nthe substantial number of ejections studied, we use a statistical approach\ninstead of a single-event analysis. We found three well defined periods of very\nhigh CMEs activity and two periods with no mass ejections that are preceded or\naccompanied by characteristic changes in the AR magnetic flux, free magnetic\nenergy and/or presence of electric currents. Our large sample of CMEs and long\nterm study of a single AR, provide further evidence relating AR magnetic\nactivity to CME and Flare production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The emergence of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere produces, among\nother phenomena, Ellerman bombs (EBs), which are observed in H alpha and are\ndue to magnetic reconnection in the photosphere below the chromospheric canopy.\nSigns of reconnection are also observed in other spectral lines, typical of the\nchromosphere or the transition region. An example are the UV bursts observed in\nthe transition region lines of Si IV and the upper chromospheric lines of Mg\nII. In this work we analyze high cadence, high resolution coordinated\nobservations between the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft. H alpha images from the SST\nprovide us with the positions, timings and trajectories of EBs in an emerging\nflux region. Simultaneous, co-aligned IRIS slit-jaw images at 133 (C II,\ntransition region), 140 (Si IV, transition region) and 279.6 (Mg II k, core,\nupper chromosphere) nm, as well as spectroscopy in the far and near ultraviolet\nfrom the fast spectrograph raster, allow us to study the possible\nchromospheric/transition region counterparts of those EBs. Our main goal is to\nstudy the possible temporal and spatial relationship between several\nreconnection events at different layers in the atmosphere (namely EBs and UV\nbursts), the timing history between them, and the connection of these dynamical\nphenomena to the ejection of surges in the chromosphere. We also investigate\nthe properties of an extended UV burst and their variations across the burst\ndomain. Our results suggest a scenario where simultaneous and co-spatial EBs\nand UV bursts are part of the same reconnection system occurring sequentially\nalong a vertical or nearly vertical current sheet. Heating and bidirectional\njets trace the location where reconnection takes place. These results support\nand expand those obtained from recent numerical simulations of magnetic flux\nemergence.",

We apply this method\nto probing the SGWB with space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the\nlaser interferometer space antenna (LISA). We find that the spectral density of\nthe LISA-band astrophysical foreground from compact binaries (black holes and\nneutron stars) can be predicted with percent-level accuracy assuming 10-years'\nobservations of third-generation GW detectors, e.g., cosmic explorer. While\nthis multi-band method does not apply to binary white dwarfs (BWDs) which\nusually merger before entering the frequency band of ground-based detectors, we\nlimit our foreground cleaning to frequency higher than $\\sim5$ mHz, where all\ngalactic BWDs can be individually resolved by LISA and the shape of the\nspectral density of the foreground from extragalactic BWDs can be reconstructed\nand/or modeled with certain uncertainties. After the foreground cleaning,\nLISA's sensitivity to the primordial SGWB will be substantially improved for\neither two LISA constellations where SGWB can be measured by cross correlating\ntheir outputs or only one constellation with three spacecrafts where SGWB can\nbe measured by contrasting the responses of a signal channel and a null\nchannel.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Equipping a spacecraft with multiple solar-powered electric engines (of the\nsame or different types) compounds the task of optimal trajectory design due to\npresence of both real-valued inputs (power input to each engine in addition to\nthe direction of thrust vector) and discrete variables (number of active\nengines). Each engine can be switched on/off independently and \"optimal\"\noperating power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which\ndepends on the distance from the Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth\nControl (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory optimization\nfrom the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated, which\npresents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of\nengine clusters with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be\noptimized. Moreover, engine clusters with different/mixed electric engines are\nconsidered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines. Remarkably, the\nCSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value\nproblem to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the\nresulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting solution scheme and with a random\ninitialization of the missing costates. While the approach we present is a\ncontinuous neighbor of the discontinuous extremals, we show that the\ndiscontinuous necessary conditions are satisfied in the asymptotic limit. We\nbelieve this is the first indirect method to accommodate a multi-mode control\nof this level of complexity with realistic engine performance curves. The\nresults are interesting and promising for dealing with a large family of such\nchallenging multi-mode optimal control problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The paper is concerned with examining the effects that design-for-demise\nsolutions can have not only on the demisability of components, but also on\ntheir survivability that is their capability to withstand impacts from space\ndebris. First two models are introduced. A demisability model to predict the\nbehaviour of spacecraft components during the atmospheric re-entry and a\nsurvivability model to assess the vulnerability of spacecraft structures\nagainst space debris impacts. Two indices that evaluate the level of\ndemisability and survivability are also proposed. The two models are then used\nto study the sensitivity of the demisability and of the survivability indices\nas a function of typical design-for-demise options. The demisability and the\nsurvivability can in fact be influenced by the same design parameters in a\ncompeting fashion that is while the demisability is improved, the survivability\nis worsened and vice versa. The analysis shows how the design-for-demise\nsolutions influence the demisability and the survivability independently. In\naddition, the effect that a solution has simultaneously on the two criteria is\nassessed. Results shows which, among the design-for-demise parameters mostly\ninfluence the demisability and the survivability. For such design parameters\nmaps are presented, describing their influence on the demisability and\nsurvivability indices. These maps represent a useful tool to quickly assess the\nlevel of demisability and survivability that can be expected from a component,\nwhen specific design parameters are changed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Asteroids are classified as tiny and light objects in the solar system,\nhowever some of them possess orbiting moons. According to surveys, 15% of\nnear-earth asteroids have moons. The Electrical Discharge effect provides a new\nmodel that describes the formation of single, binary, and triple asteroids\ninfluenced by solar magnetic activity. In further studies, collected data was\ndrawn from the aggregation diagram of asteroids based on their average distance\nfrom the sun according to various databases, catalogs and spacecraft. The\nresults show that, in areas where solar magnetic activity is high, the binary\nasteroids are more aggregated. Then, according to results searching catalogs\nasteroids for shape, spin, and type of orbit, this paper introduces a list of\nasteroids which, may be transformed from single asteroids to binary (and\npossibly multiple asteroids) depending on a future increase of solar magnetic\nactivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Among the mitigation measures introduced to cope with the space debris issue\nthere is the de-orbiting of decommissioned satellites. Guidelines for\nre-entering objects call for a ground casualty risk no higher than 0.0001. To\ncomply with this requirement, satellites can be designed through a\ndesign-for-demise philosophy. Still, a spacecraft designed to demise has to\nsurvive the debris-populated space environment for many years. The demisability\nand the survivability of a satellite can both be influenced by a set of common\ndesign choices such as the material selection, the geometry definition, and the\nposition of the components. Within this context, two models have been developed\nto analyse the demise and the survivability of satellites. Given the competing\nnature of the demisability and the survivability, a multi-objective\noptimisation framework was developed, with the aim to identify trade-off\nsolutions for the preliminary design of satellites. As the problem is nonlinear\nand involves the combination of continuous and discrete variables, classical\nderivative based approaches are unsuited and a genetic algorithm was selected\ninstead. The genetic algorithm uses the developed demisability and\nsurvivability criteria as the fitness functions of the multi-objective\nalgorithm. The paper presents a test case, which considers the preliminary\noptimisation of tanks in terms of material, geometry, location, and number of\ntanks for a representative Earth observation mission. The configuration of the\nexternal structure of the spacecraft is fixed. Tanks were selected because they\nare sensitive to both design requirements: they represent critical components\nin the demise process and impact damage can cause the loss of the mission\nbecause of leaking and ruptures. The results present the possible trade off\nsolutions, constituting the Pareto front obtained from the multi-objective\noptimisation.",
