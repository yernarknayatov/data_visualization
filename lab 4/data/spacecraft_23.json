    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar wind classification is conducive to understand the physical processes\nongoing at the Sun and solar wind evolution in the interplanetary space, and\nfurthermore, it is helpful for early warning of space weather events. With\nrapid developments in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning\napproaches are increasingly being used for pattern recognition. In this study,\nan approach from machine learning perspectives is developed to automatically\nclassify the solar wind at 1 AU into four types: coronal-hole-origin,\nstreamer-belt-origin, sector-reversal-region-origin, and ejecta. By exhaustive\nenumeration, an eight-dimensional scheme ($B_T$, $N_P$, $T_P$, $V_P$,\n$N_{\\alpha p}$, $T_{exp}/T_P$, $S_p$, and $M_f$) is found to perform the best\namong 8191 combinations of 13 solar wind parameters. 10 popular supervised\nmachine learning models, namely $k$ Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector\nMachines with linear and Radial Basic Function kernels, Decision Tree, Random\nForest, Adaptive Boosting, Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Quadratic\nDiscriminant Analysis, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, are applied to the\nlabeled solar wind data sets. Among them, KNN classifier obtains the highest\noverall classification accuracy, 92.8%. It significantly improves the accuracy\nby 9.6% over existing manual schemes. No solar wind composition measurements\nare needed, permitting our classification scheme to be applied to most solar\nwind spacecraft data. Besides, two application examples indicate that solar\nwind classification is helpful for the risk evaluation of predicted magnetic\nstorms and surface charging of geosynchronous spacecrafts.",

From the Thomson-scattered spectra we measure time-resolved profiles of\nelectron density, temperature, and ion flow speed, as well as\nspatially-resolved magnetic fields from proton radiography. We observe direct\nevidence of the sweeping up and acceleration of ambient ions, magnetic field\ncompression, and the subsequent deformation of the piston ion flow, key steps\nin shock formation. Even before the shock has fully formed, we observe strong\ndensity compressions and electron heating associated with the pile up of piston\nions. The results demonstrate that laboratory experiments can probe particle\nvelocity distributions relevant to collisionless shocks, and thus complement\nsimilar measurements undertaken by spacecraft missions.",

LUCID is one of the first uses of the Timepix detector technology in\nopen space, with the data providing useful insight into the performance of this\ntechnology in new environments. It provides high-sensitivity imaging\nmeasurements of the mixed radiation field, with a wide dynamic range in terms\nof spectral response, particle type and direction. The data has been analysed\nusing computing resources provided by GridPP, with a new machine learning\nalgorithm that uses the Tensorflow framework. This algorithm provides a new\napproach to processing Medipix data, using a training set of human labelled\ntracks, providing greater particle classification accuracy than other\nalgorithms. For managing the LUCID data, we have developed an online platform\ncalled Timepix Analysis Platform at School (TAPAS). This provides a swift and\nsimple way for users to analyse data that they collect using Timepix detectors\nfrom both LUCID and other experiments. We also present some possible future\nuses of the LUCID data and Medipix detectors in space.",

A better understanding of the\nphysical properties of Phaethon is needed to understand the nature of its\ncurrent and previous activity, relationship to potential source populations,\nand to plan for the upcoming flyby of the DESTINY+ spacecraft of Phaethon in\nthe 2020s. We performed rotationally-resolved spectroscopy of Phaethon at\nvisible and near-infrared wavelengths (0.4-2.5 microns) in 2007 and 2017,\nrespectively, to better understand its surface properties. The visible and\nnear-infrared observations both spanned nearly a full rotation or more and were\nunder similar observing geometries, covering the whole surface with the\nexception of the north pole. The visible wavelengths show blue slopes with only\nminor slope variations and no absorption features. The NIR data is minimally\nvarying and concave upwards, from very blue to blue-neutral with increasing\nwavelength. We fit the short-wavelength tail of Phaethon's thermal emission and\nretrieve an average visible albedo of pv = 0.08 +/- 0.01, which is lower than\nprevious measurements but plausible in light of the recent larger\nradar-measured diameter of Phaethon. We retrieve an average infrared beaming\nparameter of Phaethon of eta = 1.70 +/- 0.05, which is similar to previous\nresults. We discuss the implications of Phaethon's visible and near-infrared\nspectrum as well as the lower albedo on its origin, source population, and\nevolutionary history.",

Also other general\nrelativistic effects could be measurable, including also those proportional to\n$GMJ_2c^{-2}$, never put to the test so far. Most of the competing Newtonian\nsignals due to the classical multipoles of the planet's gravity field have\nquite different temporal signatures with respect to the post-Newtonian ones,\nmaking, thus, potentially easier disentangling them.",

We used radio dynamic spectra from the\ninstruments on three different spacecraft, STEREO-A, Wind, and STEREO-B, that\nwere located approximately 90 degrees apart from each other in 2011-2012, and\nthus gave a 360 degree view to the Sun. The radio data was compared to\nwhite-light and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of flares, EUV waves,\nand coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in five solar events. We find that the reason\nfor observing compact and intense DH type IV burst emission from only one\nspacecraft at a time is due to the absorption of emission to one direction and\nthat the emission is blocked by the solar disk and dense corona to the other\ndirection. The geometry also makes it possible to observe metric type IV bursts\nin the low corona from a direction where the higher-located DH type IV emission\nis not detectable. In the absorbed direction we found streamers present, and\nthese were estimated to be the locations of type II bursts, caused by shocks at\nthe CME flanks. The high-density plasma was therefore most probably formed by\nshock--streamer interaction. In some cases the type II-emitting region was also\ncapable of stopping later-accelerated electron beams, visible as type III\nbursts that ended near the type II burst lanes.",

The relationship implies that shocks accelerate about 10 keV electrons\n(for type II bursts) and greater than 300 MeV protons (for SGRE) roughly over\nthe same duration. The SGRE events are from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on\nboard the Fermi satellite, while the type II bursts are from the Radio and\nPlasma Wave Experiment (WAVES) on board the Wind spacecraft. Here we consider\nfive SGRE events that were not included in a previous study of events with\nlonger duration (greater than 5 hours). The five events are selected by\nrelaxing the minimum duration to 3 hours. We found that some SGRE events had a\ntail that seems to last until the end of the associated type II burst. We pay\nspecial attention to the 2011 June 2 SGRE event that did not have a large solar\nenergetic particle event at Earth or at the STEREO spacecraft that was well\nconnected to the eruption. We suggest that the preceding CME acted as a\nmagnetic barrier that mirrored protons back to Sun.",

This enabled the discovery of thousands\nof new exoplanets, and the characterization of myriad astrophysical phenomena.\nHowever, one of the challenges with interpreting Kepler data has been that no\ninstrument has provided a comparison dataset. Therefore, the replication of\nKepler time-series data has remained elusive. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite (TESS) launched in April 2018 and began science operations in July\n2018. During the TESS primary mission, it will survey 85% of the sky. NASA's\nfirst two observatories dedicated to discovering exoplanets, Kepler and TESS,\nwere simultaneously operating during 2018. While the Kepler's K2 mission\nsurveyed the ecliptic plane, TESS targets fields outside the ecliptic. However,\nduring September 2018, a small region of the sky was observed simultaneously by\nboth TESS and Kepler as part of TESS's Sector 2 (Aug 22 - Sep 20, 2018) and K2\nCampaign 19 (Sep 7 - Sep 26, 2018). The overlap region was 0.5 sq. deg. We\nidentified 171 K2 targets that fell inside TESS Sector 2 field of view, all of\nwhich are observed at 30-minute cadence by both missions. The targets range in\nbrightness in the TESS bandpass (Tmag) from 6.7-18.4, with 93 targets brighter\nthan Tmag=15, and 17 brighter than Tmag=12. This dataset provides the first\nsimultaneous, long-duration, high-precision observations of the same targets\nfrom different space-based observatories and presents an excellent opportunity\nto explore instrumental systematics present in the two telescopes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  There are two variants of the classical multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem that\nhave received considerable attention from machine learning researchers in\nrecent years: contextual bandits and simple regret minimization. Contextual\nbandits are a sub-class of MABs where, at every time step, the learner has\naccess to side information that is predictive of the best arm. Simple regret\nminimization assumes that the learner only incurs regret after a pure\nexploration phase. In this work, we study simple regret minimization for\ncontextual bandits. Motivated by applications where the learner has separate\ntraining and autonomous modes, we assume that the learner experiences a pure\nexploration phase, where feedback is received after every action but no regret\nis incurred, followed by a pure exploitation phase in which regret is incurred\nbut there is no feedback. We present the Contextual-Gap algorithm and establish\nperformance guarantees on the simple regret, i.e., the regret during the pure\nexploitation phase. Our experiments examine a novel application to adaptive\nsensor selection for magnetic field estimation in interplanetary spacecraft,\nand demonstrate considerable improvement over algorithms designed to minimize\nthe cumulative regret.",

The infrared channels of the instrument operate by combining an\nechelle grating spectrometer with an Acousto-Optical Tunable Filter (AOTF).\nUsing in-flight data, we characterized the instrument performance and\nparameterized its calibration. In particular: an accurate frequency calibration\nwas achieved, together with its variability due to thermal effects on the\ngrating. The AOTF properties and transfer function were also quantified, and we\ndeveloped and tested a realistic method to compute the spectral continuum\ntransmitted through the coupled grating + AOTF system. The calibration results\nenabled unprecedented insights into the important problem of the sensitivity of\nNOMAD to methane abundances in the atmosphere. We also deeply characterized its\nperformance under realistic conditions of varying aerosol abundances, diverse\nalbedos and changing illumination conditions as foreseen over the nominal\nmission. The results show that, in low aerosol conditions, NOMAD single\nspectrum, 1-sigma sensitivity to CH4 is around 0.33 ppbv at 20 km of altitude\nwhen performing solar occultations, and better than 1 ppbv below 30 km. In\ndusty conditions, we show that the sensitivity drops to 0 below 10 km. In Nadir\ngeometry, results demonstrate that NOMAD will be able to produce seasonal maps\nof CH4 with a sensitivity around 5 ppbv over most of planet's surface with\nspatial integration over 5x5 degrees bins. Results show also that such numbers\ncan be improved by a factor of 10 to 30 by data binning. Overall, our results\nquantify NOMAD's capability to address the variable aspects of Martian climate.",

More recently, potential environmental benefits for asteroid mining\nhave been considered. However, no quantitative estimate of these benefits has\nbeen given. This paper attempts to determine if and under which conditions\nasteroid mining would have environmental benefits, compared to either\nEarth-based mining or launching equipment and resources into space. We focus on\ntwo cases: Water supply to cis-lunar orbit and platinum mining. First, we\nconduct a state-of-the-art of current environmental life cycle assessment for\nthe space domain and platinum mining. Second, a first order environmental life\ncycle assessment is conducted, including goal and scope definition, inventory\nanalysis, and impact assessment. We compare water supply to cis-lunar orbit\nwith and without asteroid mining and go on to compare terrestrial with\nspace-based platinum mining. The results indicate that asteroid water mining\nwould have environmental benefits, as soon as the amount of water supplied via\nmining is larger than the mass of the spacecraft used for mining. For platinum\nmining, we find that by comparing the operations phase of terrestrial and space\nmining, space mining would have a lower environmental impact, if the spacecraft\nis able to return between 0.3 to 7% of its mass in platinum to Earth, assuming\n100% primary platinum or 100% secondary platinum, respectively. For future\nwork, we propose a more detailed analysis, based on a more precise inventory\nand a larger system boundary, including the production of the launcher and\nspacecraft.",

Usually, previous studies have been focused on the evolution of the\nsolar-wind plasma by using the bulk speed as an order parameter to discriminate\ndifferent regimes. In contrast, here, we study the radial evolution of pure and\nhomogeneous fast streams (i.e. well-defined streams of coronal-hole plasma that\nmaintain their identity during several solar rotations) by means of\nre-processed particle data, from the HELIOS satellites between 0.3 and 1 AU. We\nhave identified 16 intervals of unperturbed high-speed coronal hole plasma,\nfrom three different sources and measured at different radial distances. The\nobservations show that, for all three streams, (i) the proton density decreases\nas expected for a radially expanding plasma, unlike previous analysis that\nfound a slower decrease; (ii) the magnetic field deviates from the Parker\nprediction, with the radial and tangential components decreasing more slowly\nand quickly than expected, respectively; (iii) the double-adiabatic invariants\nare violated and an increase of entropy is observed; (iv) the proton-core\ntemperature anisotropy is constrained by mirror mode instability; (v) the\ncollisional frequency is not constant, but decreases as the plasma travels away\nfrom the Sun. The present work provides an insight into the heating problem in\npure fast solar wind, fitting in the context of the next solar missions, and,\nespecially for Parker Solar Probe, it enables us to predict the high-speed\nsolar-wind environment much closer to the Sun.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Spacecraft autonomy can be enhanced by vision-based navigation (VBN)\ntechniques. Applications range from manoeuvers around Solar System objects and\nlanding on planetary surfaces, to in-orbit servicing or space debris removal.\nThe development and validation of VBN algorithms relies on the availability of\nphysically accurate relevant images. Yet archival data from past missions can\nrarely serve this purpose and acquiring new data is often costly. The SurRender\nsoftware is an image simulator that addresses the challenges of realistic image\nrendering, with high representativeness for space scenes. Images are rendered\nby raytracing, which implements the physical principles of geometrical light\npropagation, in physical units. A macroscopic instrument model and scene\nobjects reflectance functions are used. SurRender is specially optimized for\nspace scenes, with huge distances between objects and scenes up to Solar System\nsize. Raytracing conveniently tackles some important effects for VBN\nalgorithms: image quality, eclipses, secondary illumination, subpixel limb\nimaging, etc. A simulation is easily setup (in MATLAB, Python, and more) by\nspecifying the position of the bodies (camera, Sun, planets, satellites) over\ntime, 3D shapes and material surface properties. SurRender comes with its own\nmodelling tool enabling to go beyond existing models for shapes, materials and\nsensors (projection, temporal sampling, electronics, etc.). It is natively\ndesigned to simulate different kinds of sensors (visible, LIDAR, etc.). Tools\nare available for manipulating huge datasets to store albedo maps and digital\nelevation models, or for procedural (fractal) texturing that generates\nhigh-quality images for a large range of observing distances (from millions of\nkm to touchdown). We illustrate SurRender performances with a selection of case\nstudies, placing particular emphasis on a 900-km Moon flyby simulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We have developed a new automated small-scale magnetic flux rope (SSMFR)\ndetection algorithm based on the Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction technique.\nWe have applied this detection algorithm to the Wind spacecraft in-situ\nmeasurements during 1996 - 2016, covering two solar cycles, and successfully\ndetected a total number of 74,241 small-scale magnetic flux rope events with\nduration from 9 to 361 minutes. This large number of small-scale magnetic flux\nropes has not been discovered by any other previous studies through this unique\napproach. We perform statistical analysis of the small-scale magnetic flux rope\nevents based on our newly developed database, and summarize the main findings\nas follows. (1) The occurrence of small-scale flux ropes has strong solar cycle\ndependency with a rate of a few hundreds per month on average. (2) The\nsmall-scale magnetic flux ropes in the ecliptic plane tend to align along the\nParker spiral. (3) In low speed ($<$ 400 km/s) solar wind, the flux ropes tend\nto have lower proton temperature and higher proton number density, while in\nhigh speed ($\\ge$ 400 km/s) solar wind, they tend to have higher proton\ntemperature and lower proton number density. (4) Both the duration and scale\nsize distributions of the small-scale magnetic flux ropes obey a power law. (5)\nThe waiting time distribution of small-scale magnetic flux ropes can be fitted\nby an exponential function (for shorter waiting times) and a power law function\n(for longer waiting times). (6) The wall-to-wall time distribution obeys double\npower laws with the break point at 60 minutes (corresponding to the correlation\nlength). (7) The small-scale magnetic flux ropes tend to accumulate near the\nheliospheric current sheet (HCS).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Controlling large swarms of robotic agents presents many challenges\nincluding, but not limited to, computational complexity due to a large number\nof agents, uncertainty in the functionality of each agent in the swarm, and\nuncertainty in the swarm's configuration. This work generalizes the swarm state\nusing Random Finite Set (RFS) theory and solves a centralized control problem\nwith a Quasi-Newton optimization through the use of Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) to overcome the aforementioned challenges. This work uses the RFS\nformulation to control the distribution of agents assuming an unknown or\nunspecified number of agents. Computationally efficient solutions are also\nobtained via the MPC version of the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator\n(ILQR), a variant of Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). Information\ndivergence is used to define the distance between the swarm RFS and the desired\nswarm configuration through the use of the modified $L_2^2$ distance.\nSimulation results using MPC and ILQR show that the swarm intensity converges\nto the desired intensity. Additionally, the RFS control formulation is shown to\nbe very flexible in terms of the number of agents in the swarm and\nconfiguration of the desired Gaussian mixtures. Lastly, the ILQR and the\nGaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density filter are used in conjunction\nto solve a spacecraft relative motion problem with imperfect information to\nshow the viability of centralized RFS control for this real-world scenario.",

The\nproposed scenario is the following: the sails are carried as a payload to a\nrelatively small heliocentric distance (0.1 - 0.3 AU). Once at the perihelion,\nthe sails are deployed. Besides electromagnetic propulsion due to the solar\nradiation, another mechanism could be convenient: thermal desorption, a\nphysical process of mass loss which can provide additional thrust as heating\nliberates atoms, embedded on the surface of a solar sail. Therefore, the sails\nexperience additional propulsive force due to the thermal desorption that\ndramatically increases the distance that sails travel per year.",

The use of very high power,\nlarge aperture DE systems to propel spacecraft is being pursued as the only\nknown, feasible method to achieve relativistic flight in our NASA Starlight and\nBreakthrough Starshot programs. In addition, other beamed power mission\nscenarios, such as orbital debris removal and our NASA program using DE for\npowering high performance ion engine missions, pose similar concerns. It is\ncritical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam\nwith the approximately 2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have modeled\nthe interception of the beam with satellites by using their orbital parameters\nand computing the likelihood of interception for many of the scenarios of the\nproposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the absolute\ninterception as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft,\nand have modeled a number of scenarios to obtain general probabilities. We have\nestablished that the probability of beam interception of any active satellite,\nincluding its orbital position uncertainty, during any of the proposed mission\nscenarios is low ($\\approx10^{-4}$). The outcome of this work gives us the\nability to predict when to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the\ncapability to turn off the DE as needed for extended mission scenarios. As\nadditional satellites are launched, our work can be readily extended to\naccommodate them. Our work can also be used to predict interception of\nastronomical adaptive optics guide-star lasers as well as more general laser\nuse.",

The two primary components of ST7-DRS are a micropropulsion system based\non colloidal micro-Newton thrusters (CMNTs) and a control system that\nsimultaneously controls the attitude and position of the spacecraft and the two\nfree-flying test masses (TMs). This paper presents our main experimental\nresults and summarizes the overall the performance of the CMNTs and control\nlaws. We find that the CMNT performance to be consistent with pre-flight\npredictions, with a measured system thrust noise on the order of\n$100\\,\\textrm{nN}/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ in the $1\\,\\textrm{mHz}\\leq f \\leq\n30\\,\\textrm{mHz}$ band. The control system maintained the TM-spacecraft\nseparation with an RMS error of less than 2$\\,$nm and a noise spectral density\nof less than $3\\,\\textrm{nm}/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ in the same band. Thruster\ncalibration measurements yield thrust values consistent with the performance\nmodel and ground-based thrust-stand measurements, to within a few percent. We\nalso report a differential acceleration noise between the two test masses with\na spectral density of roughly $3\\,\\textrm{fm}/\\textrm{s}^2/\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$\nin the $1\\,\\textrm{mHz}\\leq f \\leq 30\\,\\textrm{mHz}$ band, slightly less than\ntwice as large as the best performance reported with the baseline LISA\nPathfinder configuration and below the current requirements for the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission.",

It is a triangular constellation, with equal sides of $2,5\n\\times 10^9$ m, of three spacecraft, where heterodyne interferometry measures\nthe spacecraft distances. The stray light from the powerful transmitted beam\ncan overlap with the received one and interfere with the heterodyne signal. We\ninvestigated the contribution of random phase variations of the stray photons\nto the noise of the heterodyne signal. A balanced detection scheme more\neffectively mitigates this adverse effect than a separation of the frequencies\nof the transmitted and local radiation. In the balanced scheme, in order to\nlimit the phase noise to picometer level, the incoherent power of the stray\nlight must be kept below about 10 nW/W for an asymmetry of the recombination\nbeam splitter of 1%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On-board estimation of the pose of an uncooperative target spacecraft is an\nessential task for future on-orbit servicing and close-proximity formation\nflying missions. However, two issues hinder reliable on-board monocular vision\nbased pose estimation: robustness to illumination conditions due to a lack of\nreliable visual features and scarcity of image datasets required for training\nand benchmarking. To address these two issues, this work details the design and\nvalidation of a monocular vision based pose determination architecture for\nspaceborne applications. The primary contribution to the state-of-the-art of\nthis work is the introduction of a novel pose determination method based on\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to provide an initial guess of the pose in\nreal-time on-board. The method involves discretizing the pose space and\ntraining the CNN with images corresponding to the resulting pose labels. Since\nreliable training of the CNN requires massive image datasets and computational\nresources, the parameters of the CNN must be determined prior to the mission\nwith synthetic imagery. Moreover, reliable training of the CNN requires\ndatasets that appropriately account for noise, color, and illumination\ncharacteristics expected in orbit. Therefore, the secondary contribution of\nthis work is the introduction of an image synthesis pipeline, which is tailored\nto generate high fidelity images of any spacecraft 3D model. The proposed\ntechnique is scalable to spacecraft of different structural and physical\nproperties as well as robust to the dynamic illumination conditions of space.\nThrough metrics measuring classification and pose accuracy, it is shown that\nthe presented architecture has desirable robustness and scalable properties.",

In particular, the electrical performances\ndegradation of the irradiated samples was analyzed by means of the Displacement\nDamage Dose (DDD) method based on the NIEL (Non Ionizing Energy Loss) scaling\nhypothesis, with DDD doses computed by the SR-NIEL approach. By plotting the\nremaining factors as a function of the DDD, a single degradation curve for each\nsample type and for each electrical parameter has been found. The collapse of\nthe remaining factors on a single curve has been achieved by selecting suitable\ndisplacement threshold energies, $E_d$, for NIEL calculation. Moreover, DLTS\n(Deep level Transient Spectroscopy) technique was used to better understand the\nnature of the defects produced by irradiation. DLTS measurements reveal a good\ncorrelation between defects introduced by irradiation inside the GaAs sub-cell\nand the calculated Displacement Damage Doses.",

As these small systems further increase in\nreliability and radiation tolerance they will be able readily access higher\norbits at altitudes of 700 km and higher, where atmospheric drag has little to\nno effect. This requires alternative technologies to either de-orbit these\nsmall spacecrafts at the end of life or move them to a safe parking orbit.

Inflatables have already been proposed as\nhypersonic deccelerators that would carry large payload to the Martian surface.\nHowever, these systems are quite complex and need to withstand high-forces,\ntemperature and enable survival of a critical payload.

In this\npaper, we develop a new method to identify and locate the transients\nautomatically from simultaneous images from the two inner telescopes, known as\nHI-1, based on a correlation analysis. Correlation coefficient (cc) maps along\nthe Sun-Earth line are constructed for the period from 1 Jan 2010 to 28 Feb\n2011. From the maps, transients propagating along the Sun-Earth line are\nidentified, and a 27-day periodic pattern is revealed, especially for\nsmall-scale transients. Such a periodicity in the transient pattern is\nconsistent with the rotation of the Sun's global magnetic structure and the\nperiodic crossing of the streamer structures and slow solar wind across the\nSun-Earth line, and this substantiates the reliability of our method and the\nhigh degree of association between the small-scale transients of the slow solar\nwind and the coronal streamers. Besides, it is suggested by the cc map that\nsmall-scale transients along the Sun-Earth line are more frequent than\nlarge-scale transients by a factor of at least 2, and that they quickly\ndiffused into background solar wind within about 40 Rs in terms of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of white-light emissions.

One of the primary\nscience objectives of NEAR was the MAG experiment, which measured the magnetic\nfield in the vicinity of Eros during orbit and after landing. Eros is therefore\nat the present the best characterized asteroid using in situ measurement of\nmagnetism. MAG results suggested that Eros was very unmagnetized-with an upper\nbound on the natural remanent magnetism (NRM) placed at $1.9\\times\n10^{-6}\\mathrm{A\\cdot m^2 \\cdot kg^{-1}}$-especially when compared to meteorite\nsamples of analogous composition. Since meteorites and asteroids are typically\nbelieved to represent the remnants of disrupted parent bodies, the\nramifications of the low level of magnetization of Eros are considerable, since\nit could imply disparate origins for objects of similar composition. In this\npaper, we explore whether there are any systematic effects related to the\nactual process of measurement and derivation of the Erotian NRM, and whether\nsuch effects played a role in the low levels of NRM derived for Eros. By\nsimulating the orbit of NEAR around Eros and using the field strength values\nmeasured by NEAR, we find that we are able to place a higher bound on the NRM\nof Eros by a factor of at least an order of magnitude higher than that\noriginally suggested by Acu\u00f1a, et al.

We find that if we suppose\nEros to be made up of constituents that have roughly uniform magnetization\ndirectionally, that it is possible to infer an L or LL chondrite-type\ncomposition for Eros within the bounds of values for remanent magnetism\nreported in the meteorite record. The results provide a more rigorous\nconfirmation of the suggestion by Wasilewski, et al. (2002) that Eros cannot be\nruled out as an L- or LL-type analogue.",
