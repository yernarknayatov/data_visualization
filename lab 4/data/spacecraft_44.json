    "abstract": "Abstract:  Debris disks are thought to be sculptured by neighboring planets. The same is\ntrue for the Edgeworth-Kuiper debris disk, yet no direct observational evidence\nfor signatures of giant planets in the Kuiper belt dust distribution has been\nfound so far. Here we model the dust distribution in the outer solar system to\nreproduce the dust impact rates onto the dust detector onboard the New Horizons\nspacecraft measured so far and to predict the rates during the Neptune orbit\ntraverse. To this end, we take a realistic distribution of transneptunian\nobjects to launch a sufficient number of dust grains of different sizes and\nfollow their orbits by including radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and\nstellar wind drag, as well as the perturbations of four giant planets. In a\nsubsequent statistical analysis, we calculate number densities and lifetimes of\nthe dust grains in order to simulate a collisional cascade. In contrast to the\nprevious work, our model not only considers collisional elimination of\nparticles, but also includes production of finer debris. We find that particles\ncaptured in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune build clumps that are not removed by\ncollisions, because the depleting effect of collisions is counteracted by\nproduction of smaller fragments. Our model successfully reproduces the dust\nimpact rates measured by New Horizons out to ~23AU and predicts an increase of\nthe impact rate of about a factor of two or three around the Neptune orbit\ncrossing. This result is robust with respect to the variation of the vaguely\nknown number of dust-producing scattered disk objects, collisional outcomes,\nand the dust properties.",

On\naverage the element abundances in these events are similar to coronal\nabundances at low Z but, for heavier elements, enhancements rise as a power law\nin the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q of the ions (at coronal temperatures of 2.5-3\nMK) to a factor of 3 at Ne, 9 at Fe, and 900 for 75<Z<83. Energy dependences of\nabundances are minimal in the 2-15 MeV/amu range. The 111 of these Fe-rich\nimpulsive SEP events we found, between November 1994 and August 2013 using the\nWind spacecraft, have a 69% association rate with CMEs. The CMEs are narrow\nwith a median width of 75 deg, are characteristically from western longitudes\non the Sun, and have a median speed of ~600 km/s. Nearly all SEP onsets occur\nwithin 1.5-5 h of the CME onset. The faster (>700 km/s), wider CMEs in our\nsample are related to SEPs with coronal abundances indicating hot coronal\nplasma with fully ionized He, C, N and O and moderate enhancements of heavier\nelements, relative to He, but slower (<700 km/s), narrower CMEs emerge from\ncooler plasma where higher SEP mass-to-charge ratios, A/Q, yield much greater\nabundance enhancements, even for C/He and O/He. Apparently, the open\nmagnetic-reconnection region where the impulsive SEPs are accelerated also\nprovides the energy to drive out CME plasma, accounting for a strong, probably\nuniversal, impulsive SEP-CME association.",

We have\nused data from the IMF GSM-components with time resolution of 16 s. The\nmathematical property chosen was the statistical mean of the wavelet\ncoefficients $(\\langle Dd1 \\rangle)$. The Daubechies wavelet coefficients have\nbeen used because they represent the local regularity present in the signal\nbeing studied. The results reproduced the well-known fact that the dynamics of\nthe sheath region is more than that of the MC region. This technique could be\nuseful to help a specialist to find events boundaries when working with IMF\ndatasets, i.e., a best form to visualize the data. The wavelet coefficients\nhave the advantage of helping to find some shocks that are not easy to see in\nthe IMF data by simple visual inspection. We can learn that fluctuations are\nnot low in all MCs, in some cases waves can penetrate from the sheath to the\nMC. This methodology has not yet been tested to identify some specific\nfluctuation patterns at IMF for any other geoeffective interplanetary events,\nsuch as Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), Heliospheric Current Sheet\n(HCS) or ICMEs without MC signatures. In our opinion, as is the first time that\nthis technique is applied to the IMF data with this purpose, the presentation\nof this approach for the Space Physics Community is one of the contributions of\nthis work.",

This is illustrated by comparing dust signals in monopole and dipole\nmode on different spacecraft and environments. It explains the weak sensitivity\nof Wind/WAVES dipole antennas for dust detection, so that it is not surprising\nthat this instrument did not detect the interplanetary nanodust discovered by\nSTEREO/WAVES.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The narrow ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom flux observed by the\nInterstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has prompted numerous ideas to\nexplain its structure and properties. One of these ideas is the \"neutral solar\nwind\" scenario, which identifies the source particles as pickup protons in the\nlocal interstellar medium originating in solar wind charge-exchange\ninteractions. This scenario has been thought to require unrealistically weak\npitch-angle scattering of the pickup protons to explain the narrow structure.\nRecently, Schwadron & McComas (2013) suggested that this structure could result\nfrom a spatial retention of the pickup protons, rather than from a restricted\npitch-angle distribution. Here, we present a physically motivated, quantitative\nmechanism to produce such a spatial configuration. This mechanism is based on\nthe \"dominant turbulence\" assumption, which can be applied where the production\nof new pickup protons is slow, and has been used to successfully explain the\nlevel of turbulent heating observed in the outer solar wind. This formalism\npredicts a pickup isotropization process which adds or subtracts energy from\nthe ambient turbulent fluctuations, depending on the initial pitch angle of the\npickup protons. We show that a simple model of this process can yield a ribbon\nstructure in qualitative agreement with the observations. The results of this\nsimple model are not yet quantitatively satisfactory, but we suggest several\nimprovements which may reduce the quantitative discrepancy.",

Such extremely rare event offers a precious opportunity for the\nspacecrafts on Mars to closely study a dynamically new comet itself as well as\nthe planet-comet interaction. Meanwhile, the high speed meteoroids released\nfrom C/Siding Spring also pose a threat to physically damage the spacecrafts.\nHere we present our observations and modeling results of C/Siding Spring to\ncharacterize the comet and assess the risk posed to the spacecrafts on Mars. We\nfind that the optical tail of C/Siding Spring is dominated by larger particles\nat the time of the observation. Synchrone simulation suggests that the comet\nwas already active in late 2012 when it was more than 7 AU from the Sun. By\nparameterizing the dust activity with a semi-analytic model, we find that the\nejection speed of C/Siding Spring is comparable to comets such as the target of\nthe Rosetta mission, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Under nominal situation, the\nsimulated dust cone will miss the planet by about 20 Martian radius. At the\nextreme ends of uncertainties, the simulated dust cone will engulf Mars, but\nthe meteoric influx at Mars is still comparable to the nominal sporadic influx,\nseemly indicating that intense and enduring meteoroid bombardment due to\nC/Siding Spring is unlikely.

However, the sheer volume of data\nhas necessitated the development of automated techniques to identify and\nanalyse various phenomena. In this article, we describe the Coronal Pulse\nIdentification and Tracking Algorithm (CorPITA) for the identification and\nanalysis of coronal \"EIT waves\". CorPITA uses an intensity-profile technique to\nidentify the propagating pulse, tracking it throughout its evolution before\nreturning estimates of its kinematics. The algorithm is applied here to a\ndata-set from February 2011, allowing its capabilities to be examined and\ncritiqued. This algorithm forms part of the SDO Feature Finding Team initiative\nand will be implemented as part of the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK).\nThis is the first fully automated algorithm to identify and track the\npropagating \"EIT wave\" rather than any associated phenomena and will allow a\ndeeper understanding of this controversial phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) has been surveying the sky\ncontinuously from the second Lagrangian point (L2) between August 2009 and\nJanuary 2012. It operates with 52 high impedance bolometers cooled at 100mK in\na range of frequency between 100 GHz and 1THz with unprecedented sensivity, but\nstrong coupling with cosmic radiation. At L2, the particle flux is about 5\n$cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and is dominated by protons incident on the spacecraft.\nProtons with an energy above 40MeV can penetrate the focal plane unit box\ncausing two different effects: glitches in the raw data from direct interaction\nof cosmic rays with detectors (producing a data loss of about 15% at the end of\nthe mission) and thermal drifts in the bolometer plate at 100mK adding\nnon-gaussian noise at frequencies below 0.1Hz. The HFI consortium has made\nstrong efforts in order to correct for this effect on the time ordered data and\nfinal Planck maps. This work intends to give a view of the physical explanation\nof the glitches observed in the HFI instrument in-flight. To reach this goal,\nwe performed several ground-based experiments using protons and $\\alpha$\nparticles to test the impact of particles on the HFI spare bolometers with a\nbetter control of the environmental conditions with respect to the in-flight\ndata. We have shown that the dominant part of glitches observed in the data\ncomes from the impact of cosmic rays in the silicon die frame supporting the\nmicro-machinced bolometric detectors propagating energy mainly by ballistic\nphonons and by thermal diffusion. The implications of these results for future\nsatellite missions will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The paper describes differences in the intensity as a function of radial\ndistance of anomalous and galactic cosmic rays in the N-S heliosheaths as\nobserved by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft respectively. The anomalous cosmic\nray (ACR) intensities above a few MeV in the N heliosheath reach a maximum at\n~2009.5, about 16 AU beyond the heliospheric current sheet (HTS), thus\nindicating a possible source location for these higher energy particles. The\ngalactic cosmic ray electron and nuclei intensities continue to increase\nrapidly throughout the entire N-heliosheath out to 121.7 AU. Two sudden\nincreases of these electrons at 16.6 and 22.2 AU beyond the HTS suggest that\nthe V1 spacecraft passed significant heliosheath structures at these times.\nLater, at 121.7 AU, which is a distance of 27.6 AU beyond the initial HTS\ncrossing distance, V1 in the N heliosheath appears to pass beyond the ACR\ntrapping region as the anomalous particles disappear suddenly and completely.\nAt V2 in the S heliosheath, large 42-21 day periodic intensity variations were\nobserved for a few MeV particles just beyond the HTS crossing distance at 83.7\nAU and again about a year later when V2 was ~4 AU beyond this shock. These are\nthe dominant features of the energetic particle populations in the inner part\nof the S-heliosheath. The ACR and electrons later decreased to almost\nbackground levels until a sudden increase at 2011.25, at a distance of about 10\nAU beyond the HTS. The features observed by V2 in the S heliosheath relative to\nthose at V1 indicate a much more structured S heliosheath in which the latitude\nof V2 relative to the HCS maximum latitude (sector zone) may play an important\nrole. Estimates of a S heliosheath trapping/modulation boundary for energetic\nparticles in the range 105-110 AU are obtained in this paper from a comparison\nwith those at 121.7 AU observed in the N hemisphere.",

The construction of such ephemerides is highly constrained by the\ntracking observations, in particular range, of the space probes collected by\nthe tracking stations on the Earth. The present planetary ephemerides (DE,\nINPOP, EPM) are mainly based on such observations. However, the data used by\nthe planetary ephemerides are not the direct raw tracking data, but\nmeasurements deduced after the analysis of raw data made by the space agencies\nand the access to such processed measurements remains difficult in terms of\navailability.\nThe first part of the study deals with the analysis of the Mars Global\nSurveyor (MGS) tracking data. The tracking observations containing one-, two-,\nand three-way Doppler and two-way range are then used to reconstruct MGS orbit\nprecisely. As a supplementary exploitation of MGS, we derived the solar corona\nmodel and estimated the average electron density along the line of sight\nseparately for slow and fast wind regions. Fitting the planetary ephemerides,\nincluding additional data which were corrected for the solar corona\nperturbations, noticeably improves the extrapolation capability of the\nplanetary ephemerides and the estimation of the asteroid masses (Verma et al.,\n2013). The second part of the thesis deals with the complete analysis of the\nMESSENGER tracking data. This analysis improved the Mercury ephemeris up to two\norder of magnitude compared to any latest ephemerides. Such high precision\nephemeris, INPOP13a, is then used to perform general relativity tests of\nPPN-formalism. Our estimations of PPN parameters (? and ) are the most\nstringent than previous results (Verma et al., 2014).",

In addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 USP\ncandidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not\npass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard\ntests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false\npositive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for\nwhich more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these\nmulti-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able\nto infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with\nperiods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely\nhave companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost\nall USP planets are smaller than 2 $R_\\oplus$, possibly because gas giants in\nvery tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject\nto extremely strong stellar irradiation.

We selected SEP events associated with X and M-class\nflares at western longitudes, in order to ensure good magnetic connection to\nEarth. These events were classified into two categories according to the global\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) configuration present during the SEP\npropagation to 1AU: standard solar wind or interplanetary coronal mass\nejections (ICMEs). Our analysis shows that around 20% of all particle events\nare detected when the spacecraft is immersed in an ICME. The correlation of the\npeak particle intensity with the projected speed of the SEP-associated coronal\nmass ejection is similar in the two IMF categories of proton and electron\nevents, $\\approx 0.6$. The SEP events within ICMEs show stronger correlation\nbetween the peak proton intensity and the soft X-ray flux of the associated\nsolar flare, with correlation coefficient $r=\\,$0.67$\\pm$0.13, compared to the\nSEP events propagating in the standard solar wind, $r=\\,$0.36$\\pm$0.13. The\ndifference is more pronounced for near-relativistic electrons. The main reason\nfor the different correlation behavior seems to be the larger spread of the\nflare longitude in the SEP sample detected in the solar wind as compared to SEP\nevents within ICMEs. We discuss to which extent observational bias, different\nphysical processes (particle injection, transport, etc.), and the IMF\nconfiguration can influence the relationship between SEPs and coronal activity.",

We present a general relativistic model for the\nphase of a plane wave that accounts for contributions of all the multipoles of\nthe gravitating body, its angular momentum, as well as the contribution of\ntidal fields produced by external sources. We develop a new approach to model a\ncoherent signal transmission in the gravitational field of the solar system\nthat relies on a relativistic treatment of the phase. We use this approach to\ndescribe high-precision interferometric measurements on GRACE-FO and formulate\nthe key LRI observables, namely the phase and phase rate of a coherent laser\nlink between the two spacecraft. We develop a relativistic model for the\nLRI-enabled range between the two GRACE-FO spacecraft, accurate to less than 1\nnm, and a high-precision model for the corresponding range rate, accurate to\nbetter than 0.1 nm/s. We also formulate high-precision relativistic models for\nthe double one-way range (DOWR) and DOWR-enabled range rate observables\noriginally used on GRACE and now studied for interferometric measurements on\nGRACE-FO. Our formulation justifies the basic assumptions behind the design of\nthe GRACE-FO mission and highlights the importance of achieving nearly circular\nand nearly identical orbits for the GRACE-FO spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A drift mode accelerometer is a precision device that overcomes the much of\nthe acceleration noise and readout dynamic range limitations of traditional\nelectrostatic accelerometers. It has the potential of achieving acceleration\nnoise performance of drag-free systems over a restricted frequency band without\nthe need for external drag-free control or spacecraft propulsion. Like\ntraditional accelerometers, the drift mode accelerometer contains a\nhigh-density test mass surrounded by an electrode housing, which can control\nand sense all six degrees of freedom of the test mass. Unlike traditional\naccelerometers, the suspension system is operated with a low duty cycle so that\nthe limiting suspension force noise only acts over brief, known time intervals,\nwhich can be neglected in the data analysis. The readout is performed using a\nlaser interferometer which is immune to the dynamic range limitations of even\nthe best voltage references typically used to determine the inertial\nacceleration of electrostatic accelerometers. The drift mode accelerometer is\nrelated to the like-named operational mode of the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft,\nwhich will be used to estimate the acceleration noise associated with the LISA\nPathfinder front end electronics. This paper describes operation of such a\ndevice, develops models for its performance with respect to satellite geodesy\nand gravitational wave astrophysics applications, and discusses methods for\ntesting its performance using torsion pendula in the laboratory and the LISA\nPathfinder mission in space.",

The observations were conducted at a spacecraft distance\nof 330,000 km, resulting in a projected baseline of 220,000 km, providing the\ngreatest angular resolution ever achieved at meter wavelengths. Our analysis is\nbased on fundamental behavior of structure and coherence functions. We find\nthat the pulsar shows scintillation on two frequency scales, both much less\nthan the observing frequency; but modulation is less than 100%. We infer that\nthe scattering is weak, but a refracting wedge disperses the scintillation\npattern. The refraction angle of this \"cosmic prism\" is measured as theta_0=1.1\n- 4.4 mas, with the refraction direction being approximately perpendicular to\nthe observer velocity. We show that the observed parameters of scintillation\neffects indicate that two plasma layers lie along the line of sight to the\npulsar, at distances of 4.4 - 16.4 pc and 26 - 170 pc, and traveling in\ndifferent directions relative to the line of sight. Spectra of turbulence for\nthe two layers are found to follow a power law with the indices gamma_1 =\ngamma_2 = 3.00 +/- 0.08, significantly different from the index expected for a\nKolmogorov spectrum of turbulence, gamma=11/3.",

However, the NGRG has two new features:\nFirst, a beam-steering system to begin optical observations within ~ 1 s after\nlocation; second, a near-IR (NIR) camera viewing the same sky, for sensitivity\nto extinguished bursts. These features allow measurement of the rise phase of\nGRB optical-NIR emission. Thus far, the rise time and transition between prompt\nand afterglow in the optical and NIR are rarely measured. Rapid-response\nmeasurements explore many science topics including optical emission mechanisms\n(synchrotron vs. SSC, photospheric emission) and jet characteristics (reverse\nvs. forward shock emission, baryon-dominated vs. magnetic dominated). Rapid\noptical-NIR response can measure dynamic evolution of extinction due to\nvaporization of dust, and separate star system and galaxy dust extinction. We\ndiscuss these measurements, giving reliable detection rate estimates from\nanalysis of Swift data and scaled Swift performance. The NGRG will explore\noptical/NIR emission measured earlier than ever before, and potentially\nfainter, more extinguished GRBs than ever before. In the current era, costs are\nimportant. Our proposed modest NGRG can still produce new GRB science, while\nproviding rapid GRB alerts for the entire community for post-Swift GRB science.\nWe show that an X-ray instrument barely 1/5 the area of Swift BAT will yield a\nsignificant fraction of Swift's detection rate: more than 65 X-ray, and with a\n30 cm optical-IR telescope and modern cameras, more than 19 NIR and 14 optical\ndetections each year. In addition, active feedback control of the beam-steering\nwould remove the need for arc sec stabilization of the spacecraft, for a\nsubstantial cost saving.",

The projected rotational velocities derived by us are\nconsistent with the photometric rotation period, indicating a fairy high\ninclination angle. The average strength of the magnetic field on the surface of\nthese stars are estimated to be 1-20 G, by using the absorption line of Ca II\n8542. We could not detect any hint of binarity in our spectra, although more\ndata are needed to firmly rule out the presence of an unseen low-mass\ncompanion.

The first goal of comparatively studying these two similar yet\nextremely different systems is to shed new light on the ancient past of the\nSolar System and on the processes that shaped its formation and evolution.\nThis, in turn, would reveal whether the Solar System and the very diverse\nextrasolar systems discovered so far all share a common origin or if different\nenvironments and mechanisms were responsible for their formation. A space\nmission to the ice giants would also open up the possibility to use Uranus and\nNeptune as templates in the study of one of the most abundant type of\nextrasolar planets in the galaxy. Finally, such a mission would allow a\ndetailed study of the interplanetary and gravitational environments at a range\nof distances from the Sun poorly covered by direct exploration, improving the\nconstraints on the fundamental theories of gravitation and on the behaviour of\nthe solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A flux rope is a domain of concentration of the magnetic field $\\textbf{B}$.\nInsofar as $\\textbf{B}$ outside such a domain is considered as vanishingly\nsmall, a flux rope can be described as the core of a singularity of the outer\nvector potential $\\textbf{A}$, whose topological invariant is the magnetic flux\nthrough the rope. By 'topological' it is meant that\n$\\oint_C\\textbf{A}\\cdot\\mathrm d\\textbf{s}$ measures along any loop $C$\nsurrounding the flux rope the same constant flux $\\Phi$. The electric current\nintensity is another invariant of the theory, but non-topological. We show\nthat, in this theoretical framework, the linear force-free field (LFFF)\nLundquist model and the non-linear (NLFFF) Gold-Hoyle model of a flux rope\nexhibit stable solutions distributed over quantized strata of increasing\nenergies (an infinite number of strata in the first case, only one stratum in\nthe second case); each stratum is made of a continuous set of stable states.\nThe lowest LFFF stratum and the unique NLFFF stratum come numerically close one\nto the other, and match with a reasonable accuracy the data collected by\nspacecrafts travelling across magnetic clouds. The other LFFF strata do not\nmatch these data at all. It is not possible at this stage to claim which model\nfits better the magnetic cloud data. We also analyze in some detail the merging\nof tubes belonging to the same stratum, with conservation of the magnetic\nhelicity, and the transition of a tube from one stratum to another one, which\ndoes not conserve magnetic helicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The preparation of a space-mission that carries out any kind of imaging to\ndetect high-precision low-amplitude variability of its targets requires a\nrobust model for the expected performance of its instruments. This model cannot\nbe derived from simple addition of noise properties due to the complex\ninteraction between the various noise sources. While it is not feasible to\nbuild and test a prototype of the imaging device on-ground, realistic numerical\nsimulations in the form of an end-to-end simulator can be used to model the\nnoise propagation in the observations. These simulations not only allow\nstudying the performance of the instrument, its noise source response and its\ndata quality, but also the instrument design verification for different types\nof configurations, the observing strategy and the scientific feasibility of an\nobserving proposal. In this way, a complete description and assessment of the\nobjectives to expect from the mission can be derived. We present a\nhigh-precision simulation software package, designed to simulate photometric\ntime-series of CCD images by including realistic models of the CCD and its\nelectronics, the telescope optics, the stellar field, the jitter movements of\nthe spacecraft, and all important natural noise sources. This formalism has\nbeen implemented in a software tool, dubbed ASTROID Simulator.",

What are\nthe fundamental physical laws of the Universe? The mission concept we will\nillustrate in the following will be referred to through the acronym ODINUS,\nthis acronym being derived from its main fields of scientific investigation:\nOrigins, Dynamics and Interiors of Neptunian and Uranian Systems. As the name\nsuggests, the ODINUS mission is based on the use of two twin spacecraft to\nperform the exploration of the ice giants and their regular and irregular\nsatellites with the same set of instruments. This will allow to perform a\ncomparative study of these two systems so similar and yet so different and to\nunveil their histories and that of the Solar System.",

At 1 AU, they are associated with a smooth rotation of the\nmagnetic field vector over an extended duration and do not show clear signs of\ninteraction. We determine the characteristics of such events based on a\nnumerical simulation and identify and analyze a potential case in the\nlong-duration CME measured in situ in 2001 March 19-22. Such events may result\nin intense, long-duration geo-magnetic storms, with sawtooth events, and may\nsometimes be misidentified as isolated CMEs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents a model-based planner called the Probabilistic Sulu\nPlanner or the p-Sulu Planner, which controls stochastic systems in a goal\ndirected manner within user-specified risk bounds. The objective of the p-Sulu\nPlanner is to allow users to command continuous, stochastic systems, such as\nunmanned aerial and space vehicles, in a manner that is both intuitive and\nsafe. To this end, we first develop a new plan representation called a\nchance-constrained qualitative state plan (CCQSP), through which users can\nspecify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable\nlevel of risk. An example of a CCQSP statement is go to A through B within 30\nminutes, with less than 0.001% probability of failure.\" We then develop the\np-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to\nenable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper:\n1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a\ncontinuous domain with temporal constraints. The first capability is to ensures\nthat the probability of failure is bounded. The second capability is essential\nfor the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle\npath planning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the p-Sulu Planner by\nsimulations on two real-world scenarios: the path planning and scheduling of a\npersonal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo\nspacecraft.",

High-resolution\nimagery from the instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)\nspacecraft has been used to map a 15km diameter water ice deposit in the center\nof the crater. The water ice mound has surface features that include roughened\nice textures and layering similar to that found in the North Polar Layered\nDeposits. Features we interpret as sastrugi and sand dunes show consistent wind\npatterns within Louth over recent time. CRISM spectra of the ice mound were\nmodeled to derive quantitative estimates of water ice and contaminant\nabundance, and associated ice grain size information. These morphologic and\nspectral results are used to propose a stratigraphy for this deposit and\nadjoining sand dunes. Our results suggest the edge of the water ice mound is\ncurrently in retreat.",

The onboard\ncamera, AMICA, took more than 1400 images of Itokawa during the rendezvous\nphase. It was reported that the AMICA images were severely contaminated by\nlight scatter inside the optics. The effect made it difficult to produce the\ncolor maps at longer wavelengths (>800 nm). In this paper, we demonstrate a\nmethod to subtract the scattered light by investigating the dim halos of\nItokawa and the Moon taken by AMICA during the inflight operation. As the\nresult, we found that the overall data reduction scheme including the scattered\nlight correction enables to recognize ~3% regional differences in the relative\nreflectance spectra of Itokawa. We confirmed that the color variation in\nItokawa was largely attributed to space weathering.",
