First, an effective shock/discontinuity\ndetector has been developed.The detector has two steps.The first step is to\ncheck the ratio of the truncation errors on the coarse and fine grids and the\nsecond step is to check the local ratio of the left and right slopes. The\ncurrently popular shock/discontinuity detectors can detect shock, but mistake\nhigh frequency waves and critical points as shock and then damp the physically\nimportant high frequency waves.Preliminary results show the new\nshock/discontinuity detector is very delicate and can detect all shocks\nincluding strong, weak and oblique shocks or discontinuity in function and the\nfirst, second, and third order derivatives without artificial constants, but\nnever mistake high frequency waves and critical points, expansion waves as\nshock. This will overcome the bottle neck problem with numerical simulation for\nthe shock-boundary layer interaction, shock-acoustic interaction, image\nprocess, porous media flow, multiple phase flow and anywhere the high frequency\nwaves are important, but discontinuity exists and is mixed with high frequency\nwaves. After detecting the shock we can then use one side high order scheme for\nshocks and high order central compact scheme for the rest if the shock is\nappropriately located. Then a high order universal subroutine for finite\ndifference method is developed which can be used for any finite difference code\nfor accurate numerical derivatives.",

We studied the\nmechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally\nconsidered as a result of large background noise and non-periodic spanwise\nboundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry\nstarts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still\nsymmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the\nsmall length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss at\nthe bottom of the boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through\nejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore,\nthe internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the\nmiddle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the\nbackground noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused\nby the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses.",

Posynomial models are\nwidely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits,\naerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems\ncast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved\nefficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric\nprogramming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based\ndesign, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying\nposynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to\ndetermining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the\nexponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem\nnumerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification\nof multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given\nlarge-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking\ncoefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a\nterm representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the\nrepresentation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root\nLASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to\nsolve the problem via a sequential coordinate-descent scheme, which is suitable\nfor large-scale implementations.",

Then the expression of the\ngravity gradient torque in terms of gravitational potential derivatives is\nderived. By using the formulation of the gravitational potential, explicit\nformulations of the full fourth-order gravity gradient torque are obtained.\nThen a numerical simulation is carried out to verify our model. Findings: We\nfind that our model is more sound and precise than the previous fourth-order\nmodel due to the consideration of higher-order inertia integrals of the\nspacecraft. Numerical simulation results show that the motion of the previous\nfourth-order model is quite different from the exact motion, while our full\nfourth-order model fits the exact motion very well. Our full fourth-order model\nis precise enough for high-precision attitude dynamics and control around\nasteroids.

Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex,\nmulti-dimensional expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy\nanalytical solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical\nor simulation based approaches require a priori access to the true states,\nwhich may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully designed\nexperiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when the states are\nhidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or\nparticle filters (PF) is proposed. The approach uses SMC methods to estimate\nthe hidden states using a sequence of the available sensor measurements. The\ndeveloped method is general and can be used to approximate the PCRLB in\nnon-linear systems with non-Gaussian state and sensor noise. The efficacy of\nthe developed method is illustrated on two simulation examples, including a\npractical problem of ballistic target tracking at re-entry phase.",

The Chandrasekhar functions revealed\nto ensure a fifth order of accuracy. The focus of the subsequent analysis is on\nthe transient behavior of the perturbation frequency and phase velocity. The\nresults confirm recent observations about a jump in the temporal evolution of\nthe frequency of the wall-normal velocity signal, considered as the end of an\nEarly Transient. After this jump, the wave frequency for Plane Couette flow\nexperiences a periodic modulation about the asymptotic value, which is\nmotivated and investigated in detail. A new result is the presence of a second\nfrequency jump for the wall-normal vorticity. This fact, together with the\npossibility for different values of the signals asymptotic frequency, shows the\nexistence of an Intermediate Transient. Moreover, a connection between the\nfrequency jumps and the establishing of a self-similarity condition in time for\nboth the velocity and vorticity profiles is found and investigated for both\nPlane Couette flow and Plane Poiseuille flow.

We provide\nanalytical and simulation results on the global detection probability as a\nfunction of the fraction of Byzantines in the network. It is observed that the\ndetection performance degrades considerably when the fraction of Byzantines is\nlarge. Hence, we propose an adaptive algorithm at the FC which learns the\nByzantines' behavior over time and changes the FDR parameter to overcome the\nloss in detection performance.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The mechanical response of solids depends on temperature because the way\natoms and molecules respond collectively to deformation is affected at various\nlevels by thermal motion. This is a fundamental problem of solid state science\nand plays a crucial role in metallurgy, aerospace engineering, energy. In\nglasses the vanishing of rigidity upon increasing temperature is the reverse\nprocess of the glass transition. It remains poorly understood due to the\ndisorder leading to nontrivial (nonaffine) components in the atomic\ndisplacements. Our theory explains the basic mechanism of the melting\ntransition of amorphous (disordered) solids in terms of the lattice energy lost\nto this nonaffine motion, compared to which thermal vibrations turn out to play\nonly a negligible role. It predicts the square-root vanishing of the shear\nmodulus $G\\sim\\sqrt{T_{c}-T}$ at criticality observed in the most recent\nnumerical simulation study. The theory is also in good agreement with classic\ndata on melting of amorphous polymers (for which no alternative theory can be\nfound in the literature) and offers new opportunities in materials science.",

In\nthis proposed IDS architecture we followed clustering mechanism to build four\nlevel hierarchical network which enhance network scalability to large\ngeographical area and use both anomaly and misuse detection techniques for\nintrusion detection that concentrates on power saving of sensor nodes by\ndistributing the responsibility of intrusion detection among different layers.\nWe also introduce a policy based intrusion response system for hierarchical\narchitecture.",

To get refocused images,\nautofocus proves to be useful post-processing technique applied to estimate and\ncompensate the unknown phase errors. However, a severe drawback of the\nconventional autofocus algorithms is that they are only capable of removing\none-dimensional azimuth phase errors (APE). As the resolution becomes finer,\nresidual range cell migration (RCM), which makes the defocus inherently\ntwo-dimensional, becomes a new challenge. In this paper, correction of APE and\nresidual RCM are presented in the framework of polar format algorithm (PFA).\nFirst, an insight into the underlying mathematical mechanism of polar\nreformatting is presented. Then based on this new formulation, the effect of\npolar reformatting on the uncompensated APE and residual RCM is investigated in\ndetail. By using the derived analytical relationship between APE and residual\nRCM, an efficient two-dimensional (2-D) autofocus method is proposed.\nExperimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The main feature of the novel approach\nis a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in\ncomputational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for\nthrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to\nminimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital\nelements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution\nof the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic\nestimation of {\\Delta}V and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft\nbetween two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted\nfor. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the\nremoval of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In\nparticular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control\nmodel are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low\ncomputational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation\nproblem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of\ndebris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.",
