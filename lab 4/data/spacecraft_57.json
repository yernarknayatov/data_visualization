If the offset induced an error during\ncalibration of the raw TOD, then estimates of the WMAP CMB quadrupole might be\nsubstantially in error. A timing error during calibration would not only induce\nan artificial quadrupole-like signal in the mean sky map, it would also add\nvariance per pixel. This variance would be present in the calibrated TOD.\nLow-resolution map-making as a function of timing offset should show a minimum\nvariance for the correct timing offset. Three years of the calibrated, filtered\nWMAP 3-year TOD are compiled into sky maps at HEALPix resolution N_side=8,\nindividually for each of the K, Ka, Q, V and W band differencing assemblies\n(DA's), as a function of timing offset. The median per map of the temperature\nfluctuation variance per pixel is calculated and minimised against timing\noffset. Minima are clearly present. The timing offsets that minimise the median\nvariance are -38 \\pm 8 ms (K, Ka), -27 \\pm 3 ms (Q), -43 \\pm 8 ms (V), and -47\n\\pm 194 ms (W), i.e. an average of -30 \\pm 3 ms, where the WMAP collaboration's\npreferred offset is 0 \\pm 1.7 ms. A non-parametric bootstrap analysis rejects\nthe latter at a significance of 99.999%. The hypothesis of a -25.6 ms offset,\nsuggested by Liu, Xiong & Li from the TOD file timing offset, is consistent\nwith these minima. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the WMAP\ncalibrated TOD and inferred maps are wrongly calibrated. CMB quadrupole\nestimates (3/pi)C_2 based on the incorrectly calibrated TOD are overestimated\nby roughly 64 \\pm 6% (KQ85 mask) to 94 \\pm 10% (KQ75 mask). Ideally, the WMAP\nmap-making pipelines should be redone starting from the uncalibrated TOD and\nusing the -25.6 ms timing offset correction.",

From the Kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators,\nand a number of interesting binary stars. Of the pulsators, one shows the\nstrong, rapid pulsations typical for a V361 Hya type sdB variable (sdBV), seven\nshow long-period pulsations characteristic of V1093 Her type sdBVs, and one\nshows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. We derive\neffective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf B stars in\nthe sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdB\npulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. For the stars hotter than\nthis boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators (<10 per cent) is\nconfirmed. Interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitude\nmode in the long-period region, and several of the V1093 Her pulsators show low\namplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviour\nmay be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature region\nwhere hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.",

These represent a scenario in which protoplanets\ngrow in a region of a circumstellar disk where water ice condenses (the \"ice\nline''), but fail to accrete massive gas envelopes before the gaseous disk is\ndispersed. Each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationally\ninteracting oligarchs and a much larger number of small bodies that represent\nthe natal disk of planetesimals. We investigate systems with varying initial\nnumber of oligarchs, oligarch spacing, location of the ice line, total mass in\nthe ice line, and oligarch mean density. Systems become chaotic in ~1 Myr but\nsettle into stable configurations in 10-100 Myr. We find: (1) runs consistently\nproduce a 5-9 Earth mass planet at a semimajor axis of 0.25-0.6 times the\nposition of the ice line, (2) the distribution of planets' orbital\neccentricities is distinct from, and skewed toward lower values than the\nobserved distribution of (giant) exoplanet orbits, (3) inner systems of two\ndominant planets (e.g., Earth and Venus) are not stable or do not form because\nof the gravitational influence of the innermost icy planet. The planets\npredicted by our model are unlikely to be detected by current Doppler\nobservations. Microlensing is currently sensitive to the most massive planets\nfound in our simulations. A scenario where up to 60% of stars host systems such\nas those we simulate is consistent with all the available data. We predict\nthat, if this scenario holds, the NASA Kepler spacecraft will detect about 120\nplanets by two or more transits over the course of its 3.5 yr mission. Future\nmicrolensing surveys will detect ~130 analogs over a 5 yr survey. Finally, the\nSpace Interferometry Mission (SIM-Lite) should be capable of detecting 96% of\nthe innermost icy planets over the course of a 5 yr mission.",

This simulation has led to the\nprediction of anomaly values, to be expected for the Rosetta flybys of Mars in\n2007, and following twice of Earth in 2007 and 2009. While the data for the\nMars flyby are yet under evaluation, the predictions of the formula for the\nlast two Earth flybys of Rosetta are fully confirmed now. This is remarkable,\nsince an alternatively proposed formula (Anderson et al., 2007) failed to\npredict the correct values for the recent flybys. For the Mercury flybys of the\nMessenger spacecraft, this alternative formula predicts a null result. In the\nmeantime, Doppler residuals of these flybys on 14.01.2008 and 06.10.2008 are\navailabel. On both flybys, significant residuals were observed, using gravity\ndata derived by Mariner 10 on Mercury (D. E. Smith et al., 2009). According to\nthe authors, these residuals cannot be eliminated totally by adjustment of the\nsecond degree gravity coefficients and by assumption of irregular mass\nconcentrations of acceptable value on Mercury. In this investigation, I adapt\nthe output of the simulation program to compare with the measured Doppler\nresiduals of the Mercury flybys without changing the formerly derived\nparameters for the Earth flybys. The simulation with these parameters leads to\nDoppler residuals of the Mercury flybys compatible with the measured curves.\nAdditionally, the expected flyby anomalies are calculated. Since the gravity\nfield of Mercury is not explored yet with sufficient accuracy, this result\ncannot be falsified or confirmed until the evaluation of the coming Mercury\norbits of Messenger will be finished. If the proposed empirical formula would\nbe confirmed then again, this would be a strong indication of an underlying\nphysical reality.",

Our results can be used to\nverify theoretical predictions, to understand the formation and nature of solar\nwind turbulence. We found that the correlation length varies over almost six\norders of magnitude. The IMF turbulence shows significant anisotropy with two\ndistinct populations. In certain time intervals the ratio of the three axes of\nthe correlation ellipse is 1/2.2/6 while in the remaining time we found\nextremely high correlation along one axis.

We discuss the\nimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbital\ninclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as well\nas their likely masses and chemical compositions. A Monte Carlo study indicates\nthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectable\ntransit timing variations (TTV) due to gravitational interactions---though none\nare apparent in these data. We also discuss new challenges that arise in TTV\nanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.",

As a logical extrapolation from several highly\nsuccessful aperture masking programs underway worldwide, pupil remapping offers\nthe advantage of spatial filtering (with single-mode fibers) and in principle\ncan avoid the penalty of low throughput inherent to an aperture mask. However\nin practice, pupil remapping presents a number of difficult technological\nchallenges including injection into the fibers, pathlength matching of the\ndevice, and stability and reproducibility of the results. Here we present new\napproaches based on recently-available photonic technologies in which coherent\nthree-dimensional waveguide structures can be sculpted into bulk substrate.\nThese advances allow us to miniaturize the photonic processing into a single,\nrobust, thermally stable element; ideal for demanding observatory or spacecraft\nenvironments. Ultimately, a wide range of optical functionality could be\nroutinely fabricated into such structures, including beam combiners and\ndispersive or wavelength selective elements, bringing us closer to the vision\nof an interferometer on a chip.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Analysis of the Interball-1 spacecraft data (1995-2000) has shown that the\nsolar wind ion flux sometimes increases or decreases abruptly by more than 20%\nover a time period of several seconds or minutes. Typically, the amplitude of\nsuch sharp changes in the solar wind ion flux (SCIFs) is larger than 0.5x10^8\ncm^-2 s^-1. These sudden changes of the ion flux were also observed by the\nSolar Wind Experiment (SWE), on board the WIND spacecraft, as the solar wind\ndensity increases and decreases with negligible changes in the solar wind\nvelocity. SCIFs occur irregularly at 1 AU, when plasma flows with specific\nproperties come to the Earth's orbit. SCIFs are usually observed in slow,\nturbulent solar wind with increased density and interplanetary magnetic field\nstrength. The number of times SCIFs occur during a day is simulated using the\nsolar wind density, magnetic field, and their standard deviations as input\nparameters for a period of 5 years. A correlation coefficient of ~0.7 is\nobtained between the modelled and the experimental data. It is found that SCIFs\nare not associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), corotating interaction\nregions (CIRs), or interplanetary shocks; however, 85% of the sector boundaries\nare surrounded by SCIFs. The properties of the solar wind plasma for days with\n5 or more SCIF observations are the same as those of the solar wind plasma at\nthe sector boundaries. One possible explanation for the occurrence of SCIFs\n(near sector boundaries) is magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current\nsheet or local current sheets. Other probable causes of SCIFs (inside sectors)\nare turbulent processes in the slow solar wind and at the crossings of flux\ntubes.",

We study the dynamical evolution of\nsuch 20-50m sized bodies which are embedded in Saturn's rings. We estimate the\nimportance of various interaction processes with the ring particles on the\nmoonlet's eccentricity and semi-major axis analytically. For low ring surface\ndensities, the main effects on the evolution of the eccentricity and the\nsemi-major axis are found to be due to collisions and the gravitational\ninteraction with particles in the vicinity of the moonlet. For large surface\ndensities, the gravitational interaction with self-gravitating wakes becomes\nimportant.\nWe also perform realistic three dimensional, collisional N-body simulations\nwith up to a quarter of a million particles. A new set of pseudo shear periodic\nboundary conditions is used which reduces the computational costs by an order\nof magnitude compared to previous studies. Our analytic estimates are confirmed\nto within a factor of two.\nOn short timescales the evolution is always dominated by stochastic effects\ncaused by collisions and gravitational interaction with self-gravitating ring\nparticles. These result in a random walk of the moonlet's semi-major axis. The\neccentricity of the moonlet quickly reaches an equilibrium value due to\ncollisional damping. The average change in semi-major axis of the moonlet after\n100 orbital periods is 10-100m. This translates to an offset in the azimuthal\ndirection of several hundred kilometres. We expect that such a shift is easily\nobservable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Since the 1970's, when the Viking spacecrafts carried out experiments aimed\nto the detection of microbial metabolism on the surface of Mars, the search for\nnonspecific methods to detect life in situ has been one of the goals of\nastrobiology. It is usually required that the methodology can detect life\nindependently from its composition or form, and that the chosen biological\nsignature points to a feature common to all living systems, as the presence of\nmetabolism. In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)\nfor the detection of microbial life in situ. MFCs are electrochemical devices\noriginally developed as power electrical sources, and can be described as fuel\ncells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms.\nThese microorganisms, as part of their metabolic process, oxidize organic\nmaterial releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current, which is\ntherefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes. We show that\npower and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures\nor soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium\nfree of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples, respectively. In particular,\nwe found that this is true for extremophiles, usually proposed to live in\nextraterrestrial environments. Therefore, our results show that MFCs have the\npotential to be used to detect microbial life in situ.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Hundred meter sized objects have been identified by the Cassini spacecraft in\nSaturn's A ring through the so-called \"propeller\" features they create in the\nring. These moonlets should migrate, due to their gravitational interaction\nwith the ring ; in fact, some orbital variation have been detected. The\nstandard theory of type I migration of planets in protoplanetary disks can't be\napplied to the ring system, as it is pressureless. Thus, we compute the\ndifferential torque felt by a moonlet embedded in a two-dimensional disk of\nsolid particles, with flat surface density profile, both analytically and\nnumerically. We find that the corresponding migration rate is too small to\nexplain the observed variations of the propeller's orbit in Saturn's A-ring.\nHowever, local density fluctuations (due to gravity wakes in the marginally\ngravitationally stable A-ring) may exert a stochastic torque on a moonlet. Our\nsimulations show that this torque can be large enough to account for the\nobservations, depending on the parameters of the rings. We find that on time\nscales of several years the migration of propellers is likely to be dominated\nby stochastic effects (while the former, non-stochastic migration dominates\nafter ~ 10^{4-5} years). In that case, the migration rates provided by\nobservations so far suggests that the surface density of the A ring should be\nof the order of 700 kg/m^2. The age of the propellers shouldn't exceed 1 to 100\nmillion years, depending on the dominant migration regime.",

The numerical solutions show that, under certain conditions, a\nspacecraft can take on a negative potential in spite of strong photoelectron\ncurrents. The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the\nsurface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the\nphotoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if\n(1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds\nthe ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger\nthan local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron\nenergy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping\nphotoelectrons. All of these conditions are present near the Sun. The numerical\nsolutions also show that the spacecraft's negative potential can be amplified\nby an ion wake. The negative potential of the ion wake prevents secondary\nelectrons from escaping the part of spacecraft in contact with the wake. These\nfindings may be important for future spacecraft missions that go nearer to the\nSun, such as Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), is the Herschel Space\nObservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band\nimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imaging\nFourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole\noperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are\narrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a\nfield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.\nIts main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned\nacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if\ndesired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a\ndiameter of 2.6'. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25\nGHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating\nmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror\nto acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position\noffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve\nthe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map\nareas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold\nfocal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics\nunits, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and\ndata handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data\ncompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science\nproducts. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds\npredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer\nsensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and\nthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.",

The scientific objectives of the SVOM GRB studies cover their\nclassification (GRB diversity and unity of the model), their physics (particle\nacceleration and radiation mechanisms), their progenitors, cosmological studies\n(host galaxies, star formation history, re-ionization, cosmological\nparameters), and fundamental physics (origin of cosmic rays, Lorentz\ninvariance, gravitational wave sources). From 2015 on, SVOM will provide fast\nand accurate localizations of all known types of GRB, and determine the\ntemporal and spectral properties of the GRB emission, thanks to a set of four\nonboard instruments. The trigger system of the coded-mask telescope ECLAIRs\nonboard SVOM images the sky in the 4-120 keV energy range, in order to detect\nand localize GRB in its 2 sr-wide field of view. The low-energy threshold of\nECLAIRs is well suited for the detection of highly red-shifted GRB. The\nhigh-energy coverage is extended up to 5 MeV thanks to a non-imaging gamma-ray\nspectrometer. GRB alerts are sent in real-time to the ground observers\ncommunity, and a spacecraft slew is performed in order to place the GRB within\nthe narrow fields of view of a soft X-ray telescope and a visible-band\ntelescope, to refine the GRB position and study its early afterglow.\nGround-based robotic telescopes and wide-angle cameras complement the onboard\ninstruments. A large fraction of GRB will have redshift determinations, thanks\nto an observing strategy optimized to facilitate follow-up observations by\nlarge ground-based spectroscopic telescopes.",

While some areas of astronomy (most notably\npulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of\nconsiderably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have\ncrossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have\nfound that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups\ncan differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be\nmistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We\nargue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric\nand barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is\nimperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1\nminute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to\nquote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD_TDB, the Barycentric\nJulian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical\nevent. The BJD_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for\nextra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the\ntarget system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered\nin order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond.\nFinally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate\nBJD_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth\nor from any spacecraft.",

In this paper we model zonal averages of thermal infrared spectra\nfrom the two instruments, Voyager 1 IRIS and Cassini CIRS, to retrieve the\nvertical and meridional profiles of temperature, and the abundances of the two\nminor hydrocarbons, acetylene (C2H2) and ethane (C2H6). The spatial variation\nof these gases is controlled by both chemistry and dynamics, and therefore\ntheir observed distribution gives us an insight into both processes. We find\nthat the two gases paint quite different pictures of seasonal change. Whilst\nthe 2-D cross-section of C2H6 abundance is slightly increased and more\nsymmetric in 2000 (northern summer solstice) compared to 1979 (northern fall\nequinox), the major trend of equator to pole increase remains. For C2H2 on the\nother hand, the Voyager epoch exhibits almost no latitudinal variation, whilst\nthe Cassini era shows a marked decrease polewards in both hemispheres. At the\npresent time, these experimental findings are in advance of interpretation, as\nthere are no published models of 2-D Jovian seasonal chemical variation\navailable for comparison.",

In CMEs\nthey are believed to indicate the opening up of the coronal magnetic fields at\nthe start of the eruption. Aims: It is to determine whether coronal dimming\nseen in small-scale eruptions starts before or after chromospheric plasma\nejection. Methods: One STEREO spacecraft obtained high cadence, 75 s, images in\nthe He II 304A channel, and the other simultaneous images in the Fe IX/FeX 171A\nchannel. We concentrate on two well-positioned chromospheric eruptions that\noccurred at disk center in the 171A images, and on the limb in 304A. One was in\nthe quiet Sun and the other was in an equatorial coronal hole. We compare the\ntiming of chromospheric eruption seen in the 304A limb images with the\nbrightenings and dimmings seen on disk in the 171A images. Further we use\noff-limb images of the low frequency 171A power to infer the coronal structure\nnear the eruptions. Results: In both the quiet Sun and the coronal hole\neruption, on disk 171A dimming was seen before the chromospheric eruption, and\nin both cases it extends beyond the site of the chromospheric eruption. The\nquiet Sun eruption occurred on the outer edge of the enclosing magnetic field\nof a prominence and may be related to a small disruption of the prominence just\nbefore the 171A dimming. Conclusions: These small-scale chromospheric eruptions\nstarted with a dimming in coronal emission just like their larger counterparts.\nWe therefore suggest that a fundamental step in triggering them was the removal\nof overlying coronal field.",

Uncertainties of the\norder of 10-30 microarcseconds in the inclinations yield \\delta c_1=7.9 10^-9\nwhich corresponds to an uncanceled J_2 signature of 6.5 milliarcseconds per\nyear, i.e. 14% of the Lense-Thirring signal.

However, the W44 expands into weakly ionized\ndense gas, and so a significant revision of the mechanism is required. In this\npaper we provide the necessary modifications and demonstrate that strong\nion-neutral collisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the\nenergy spectrum of accelerated particles by \\emph{exactly one power}. The\nspectral break is caused by Alfven wave evanescence leading to the fractional\nparticle losses. The gamma-ray spectrum generated in collisions of the\naccelerated protons with the ambient gas is also calculated and successfully\nfitted to the Fermi Observatory data. The parent proton spectrum is best\nrepresented by a classical test particle power law E^-2, steepening to E^-3 at\nE_br~7GeV due to deteriorated particle confinement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Dawn is the first NASA mission to operate in the vicinity of the two most\nmassive asteroids in the main belt, Ceres and Vesta. This double-rendezvous\nmission is enabled by the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion. Dawn\nwill arrive at Vesta in 2011 and will operate in its vicinity for approximately\none year. Vesta's mass and non-spherical shape, coupled with its rotational\nperiod, presents very interesting challenges to a spacecraft that depends\nprincipally upon low-thrust propulsion for trajectory-changing maneuvers. The\ndetails of Vesta's high-order gravitational terms will not be determined until\nafter Dawn's arrival at Vesta, but it is clear that their effect on Dawn\noperations creates the most complex operational environment for a NASA mission\nto date. Gravitational perturbations give rise to oscillations in Dawn's\norbital radius, and it is found that trapping of the spacecraft is possible\nnear the 1:1 resonance between Dawn's orbital period and Vesta's rotational\nperiod, located approximately between 520 and 580 km orbital radius.This\nresonant trapping can be escaped by thrusting at the appropriate orbital phase.\nHaving passed through the 1:1 resonance, gravitational perturbations ultimately\nlimit the minimum radius for low-altitude operations to about 400 km,in order\nto safely prevent surface impact. The lowest practical orbit is desirable in\norder to maximize signal-to-noise and spatial resolution of the Gamma-Ray and\nNeutron Detector and to provide the highest spatial resolution observations by\nDawn's Framing Camera and Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer. Dawn dynamical\nbehavior is modeled in the context of a wide range of Vesta gravity models.\nMany of these models are distinguishable during Dawn's High Altitude Mapping\nOrbit and the remainder are resolved during Dawn's Low Altitude Mapping Orbit,\nproviding insight into Vesta's interior structure.",

The distribution of H atoms obtained in the frame of the\nself-consistent kinetic-gasdynamic model of the heliospheric interface is\ncompared with a simplified model which assumes Maxwellian distribution of H\natoms at the termination shock and is called often as 'hot' model. This\ncomparison shows that the distribution of H atoms is significantly affected by\nthe heliospheric interface not only at large heliocentric distances, but also\nin vicinity of the Sun at 1-5 AU. Hence, for analysis of experimental data\nconnected with direct or undirect measurements of the interstellar atoms one\nnecessarily needs to take into account effects of the heliospheric interface.\nIn this paper we propose a new model that is relatively simple but takes into\naccount all major effects of the heliospheric interface.

During the last\nsix 11-year cycles the average amplitude of these production changes is 36%.\nThese predictions are compared with measurements of 10Be concentration in polar\nice cores in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere over the same time\nperiod. We find a large scatter between the predicted and measured yearly\naverage data sets and a low cross correlation ~0.30. Also the normalized\nregression line slope between 10Be production changes and 10Be concentration\nchanges is found to be only 0.4-0.6; much less than the value of 1.0 expected\nfor a simple proportionality between these quantities, as is typically used for\nhistorical projections of the relationship between 10Be concentration and solar\nactivity. The distribution of yearly averages in the 10Be concentration level\nin the data from the Dye-3 ice core in Greenland for the time period 1939-1985,\ncontains a \"spike\" of high concentration one year averages which is not seen in\nthe production calculations.

The\nproblem of space debris is similar to other international environmental\nproblems in that there is a potential for a tragedy of the commons\neffect--individual nations bear all the cost of their mitigation measures but\nshare only a fraction of the benefit. Consequently, nations have a tendency to\nunderinvest in mitigation. Coalitions of nations, brought together by IEAs,\nhave the potential to lessen the tragedy of the commons effect by pooling the\ncosts and benefits of mitigation. This work brings together two recent modeling\nadvances: i) a game theoretic model for studying the potential gains from IEA\ncooperation between nations with asymmetric costs and benefits, ii) an orbital\ndebris model that gives the societal cost that specific actions, such as\nfailing to deorbit an inactive satellite, have on the environment. We combine\nthese two models with empirical launch share data for a \"proof of concept\" of\nan IEA for a single mitigation measure, deorbiting spacecraft at the end of\noperational lifetime.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Because energetic particles populate both planetary magnetospheres and\ninterplanetary space in significant quantities, energetic-ion sensors have been\nflown since the beginning of the space age. Early sensors were solid-state\ndetector (SSD) telescopes, with conical fields of view, often swept through a\ncircle by virtue of the spin motion of the spacecraft (e.g., IMP 7 and 8, ISEE\n1 and 2). In the 1980s and 1990s, foil/microchannel plate (MCP) time-of-flight\n(TOF) measurements were added to the energy measurement provided by the SSD\n(eg, AMPTE/CCE MEPA, Geotail EPIC/ICS, Galileo EPD). The resulting energy and\nvelocity uniquely identified ion mass. More recently, we have developed a 2-D\nfan acceptance angle sensor that includes both energy and TOF. When mounted on\na spinning spacecraft, this 160^\\circ x 12^\\circ FOV sweeps out nearly 4\\pi\nsteradians in one spin. This sensor, dubbed the \"hockey puck\" for its shape, is\ncurrently in flight on MESSENGER (EPS) and New Horizons Pluto\n(PEPPSI).Increasingly, energetic-ion sensors fly on 3-axis stabilized\nspacecraft (e.g., MESSENGER EPS, New Horizons (Pluto) PEPPSI, Cassini MIMI.\nWhile 3-axis stabilization serves imaging science well, it hampers the goal of\nobtaining 4\\pi-steradian ion measurements. We are developing an energetic-ion\nsensor that measures ion energy and composition, and covers 2\\pi steradians on\na 3-axis-stabilized spacecraft without an articulation mechanism. Based on its\nshape, we refer to this design as the \"mushroom\".

Bragg crystal spectrometer X-ray observations\nhave generally concentrated on flares and active regions. The high sensitivity\nof the RESIK (REntgenovsky Spectrometer s Izognutymi Kristalami) instrument on\nthe CORONAS-F solar mission has enabled the X-ray emission from the quiet\ncorona to be studied in a systematic way for the first time. Our aim is to\ndeduce the physical conditions of the non-flaring corona from RESIK line\nintensities in several spectral ranges using both isothermal and multithermal\nassumptions. We selected and analyzed spectra in 312 quiet-Sun intervals in\nJanuary and February 2003, sorting them into 5 groups according to activity\nlevel. For each group, the fluxes in selected spectral bands have been used to\ncalculate values parameters for the best-fit that lead to a intensities\ncharacteristic of each group. We used both isothermal and multitemperature\nassumptions, the latter described by differential emission measure (DEM)\ndistributions. RESIK spectra cover the wavelength range (3.3-6.1 A). This\nincludes emission lines of highly ionized Si, S, Cl, Ar, and K, which are\nsuitable for evaluating temperature and emission measure, were used. The RESIK\nspectra during these intervals of very low solar activity for the first time\nprovide information on the temperature structure of the quiet corona. Although\nmost of the emission seems to arise from plasma with a temperature between 2MK\nand 3MK, there is also evidence of a hotter plasma (T approx. 10MK) with an\nemission measure 3 orders smaller than the cooler component. Neither coronal\nnor photospheric element abundances appear to describe the observed spectra\nsatisfactorily.",

We investigate this\nrelationship by comparing the near-infrared (0.7-2.5 micron) spectra of 39\nV-type asteroids to laboratory spectra of HED meteorites. The central\nwavelengths and areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron pyroxene-olivine absorption\nbands that are characteristic of planetary basalts are measured for both the\nasteroidal and meteoritic data. The band centers are shown to be well\ncorrelated, however the ratio of areas spanned by the 1 and 2 micron absorption\nbands are much larger for the asteroids than for the meteorites. We argue that\nthis offset in band area ratio is consistent with our currently limited\nunderstanding of the effects of space weathering, however we can not rule out\nthe possibility that this offset is due to compositional differences. Several\nother possible causes of this offset are discussed.\nAmongst these inner Main Belt asteroids we do not find evidence for\nnon-Vestoid mineralogies. Instead, these asteroids seem to represent a\ncontinuum of compositions, consistent with an origin from a single\ndifferentiated parent body. In addition, our analysis shows that V-type\nasteroids with low inclinations (i < 6 degrees) tend to have band centers\nslightly shifted towards long wavelengths. This may imply that more than one\ncollision on Vesta's surface was responsible for producing the observed\npopulation of inner belt V-type asteroids. Finally, we offer several\npredictions that can be tested when the Dawn spacecraft enters into orbit\naround Vesta in the summer of 2011.",

Several observations of this asteroid have been so far\nperformed, but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate.\nFor long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high\nIRAS albedo. Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition\nsimilar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while further\nobservations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite\nchondrite meteorites. AIMS: In order to give an important contribution in\nsolving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia, in November 2008 we performed\nvisible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). METHODS: Thirteen visible spectra have been\nacquired at different rotational phases. RESULTS: We confirm the presence of a\nnarrow spectral feature at about 0.47-0.48 micron already found by Lazzarin et\nal. (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia. We also find a spectral feature at about\n0.6 micron, detected by Lazzarin et al. (2004) on one of their Lutetia's\nspectra. More importantly, our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes\nbetween 0.6 and 0.75 micron and, in particular, we found that up to 20% of the\nLutetia surface could have flatter spectra. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a\nvariation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be\ninterpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical\ncomposition, as well as to inhomogeneities of the structure of the Lutetia's\nsurface (e.g., the presence of craters or albedo spots) in the southern\nhemisphere.",

We\nargue that this work both shows a practical method for using formal\nspecifications in testing and opens interesting research avenues, including a\nchallenging specification learning problem.",
