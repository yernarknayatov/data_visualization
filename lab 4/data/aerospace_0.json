    "abstract": "Abstract:  The design of novel devices with specific technical interests through\nmodulating structural properties and bonding characteristics promotes the\nvigorous development of materials informatics. Herein, we propose a synergy\nstrategy of component reconstruction by combining geometric configuration and\nbonding characteristics. With the synergy strategy, we designed a novel\ntwo-dimensional (2D) graphene-like borides, e.g. g-B3N5, which possesses\ncounter-intuitive ultra-low thermal conductivity of 21.08 W/mK despite the\nsmall atomic mass. The ultra-low thermal conductivity is attributed to the\nsynergy effect of electronics and geometry on thermal transport due to the\ncombining reconstruction of g-BN and nitrogene. With the synergy effect, the\ndominant acoustic branches are strongly softened, and the scattering absorption\nand Umklapp process are simultaneously suppressed. Thus, the thermal\nconductivity is significantly lowered. To verify the component reconstruction\nstrategy, we further constructed g-B3P5 and g-B3As5, and uncovered the\nultra-low thermal conductivity of 2.50 and 1.85 W/mK, respectively. The synergy\neffect and the designed ultra-low thermal conductivity materials with\nlightweight atomic mass cater to the demand for light development of momentum\nmachinery and heat protection, such as aerospace vehicles, high-speed rail,\nautomobiles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  LiteBIRD, the Lite (Light) satellite for the study of B-mode polarization and\nInflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection, is a space mission for\nprimordial cosmology and fundamental physics. The Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA) selected LiteBIRD in May 2019 as a strategic large-class\n(L-class) mission, with an expected launch in the late 2020s using JAXA's H3\nrocket. LiteBIRD is planned to orbit the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, where\nit will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization over the entire\nsky for three years, with three telescopes in 15 frequency bands between 34 and\n448 GHz, to achieve an unprecedented total sensitivity of 2.2$\\mu$K-arcmin,\nwith a typical angular resolution of 0.5$^\\circ$ at 100 GHz. The primary\nscientific objective of LiteBIRD is to search for the signal from cosmic\ninflation, either making a discovery or ruling out well-motivated inflationary\nmodels. The measurements of LiteBIRD will also provide us with insight into the\nquantum nature of gravity and other new physics beyond the standard models of\nparticle physics and cosmology. We provide an overview of the LiteBIRD project,\nincluding scientific objectives, mission and system requirements, operation\nconcept, spacecraft and payload module design, expected scientific outcomes,\npotential design extensions and synergies with other projects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Inverse problems exist in a wide variety of physical domains from aerospace\nengineering to medical imaging. The goal is to infer the underlying state from\na set of observations. When the forward model that produced the observations is\nnonlinear and stochastic, solving the inverse problem is very challenging.\nNeural networks are an appealing solution for solving inverse problems as they\ncan be trained from noisy data and once trained are computationally efficient\nto run. However, inverse model neural networks do not have guarantees of\ncorrectness built-in, which makes them unreliable for use in safety and\naccuracy-critical contexts. In this work we introduce a method for verifying\nthe correctness of inverse model neural networks. Our approach is to\noverapproximate a nonlinear, stochastic forward model with piecewise linear\nconstraints and encode both the overapproximate forward model and the neural\nnetwork inverse model as a mixed-integer program. We demonstrate this\nverification procedure on a real-world airplane fuel gauge case study. The\nability to verify and consequently trust inverse model neural networks allows\ntheir use in a wide variety of contexts, from aerospace to medicine.",

These alloys find a wide range of applications\nranging from aerospace to automobile and naval industries due to their low cost\nand high strength to weight ratio. Structures made from Al-based alloys undergo\ncomplex loading conditions such as high strain rate impact, which involves high\npressures. Here we use diamond anvil cells to study the behavior of Al-based\nAl7075 alloy under quasi-hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure up to ~53\nGPa. In situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pre- and post-compression transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) imaging are used to analyze microstructural changes\nand estimate high pressure strength. We find a bulk modulus of 75.2 +- 1.9 GPa\nusing quasi-hydrostatic pressure XRD measurements. XRD showed that\nnon-hydrostatic pressure leads to a significant increase in defect density and\npeak broadening with pressure cycling. XRD mapping under non-hydrostatic\npressure revealed that the region with the highest local pressure had the\ngreatest increase in defect nucleation, whereas the region with the largest\nlocal pressure gradient underwent texturing and had larger grains. TEM analysis\nshowed that pressure cycling led to the nucleation and growth of many\nprecipitates. The significant increase in defect and precipitate density leads\nto an increase in strength for Al7075 alloy at high pressures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Planetary rover systems need to perform terrain segmentation to identify\ndrivable areas as well as identify specific types of soil for sample\ncollection. The latest Martian terrain segmentation methods rely on supervised\nlearning which is very data hungry and difficult to train where only a small\nnumber of labeled samples are available. Moreover, the semantic classes are\ndefined differently for different applications (e.g., rover traversal vs.\ngeological) and as a result the network has to be trained from scratch each\ntime, which is an inefficient use of resources. This research proposes a\nsemi-supervised learning framework for Mars terrain segmentation where a deep\nsegmentation network trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images is\ntransferred to the task of terrain segmentation trained on few labeled images.\nThe network incorporates a backbone module which is trained using a contrastive\nloss function and an output atrous convolution module which is trained using a\npixel-wise cross-entropy loss function. Evaluation results using the metric of\nsegmentation accuracy show that the proposed method with contrastive\npretraining outperforms plain supervised learning by 2%-10%. Moreover, the\nproposed model is able to achieve a segmentation accuracy of 91.1% using only\n161 training images (1% of the original dataset) compared to 81.9% with plain\nsupervised learning.",

Human Factors and Ergonomics first\nshifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa\nthe 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital\ninteraction design and User Experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of\ninteractive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but\nbecause they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the\nearly 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the\npoint that complex systems design and management found itself center stage,\nwith the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups.\nToday, Human Systems Integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent\nproblem, but a multi-agent research field. Systems are systems of systems,\nconsidered as representations of people and machines. They are made of\nstatically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are\nat work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and\nstructures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e., in their constant\nredesign). This chapter will more specifically, focus on human factors such as\nhuman-centered systemic representations, life critical systems, organizational\nissues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility,\ntangibility and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in\ncivil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.",

The proposed\napproach prescribes a structure for the controller based on relevant scientific\nknowledge (such as Lyapunov stability theory or domain experiences) while\nconsidering the tunable elements inside the given structure as the point of\nparametrisation with neural networks. To optimise a cost represented as a\nfunction of the neural network weights, the proposed approach utilises the\ncontinuous-time policy gradient method based on adjoint sensitivity analysis as\na means for correct and performant computation of cost gradient. This enables\ncombining the stability, robustness, and physical interpretability of an\nanalytically-derived structure for the feedback controller with the\nrepresentational flexibility and optimised resulting performance provided by\nmachine learning techniques. Such a hybrid paradigm for fixed-structure control\nsynthesis is particularly useful for optimising adaptive nonlinear controllers\nto achieve improved performance in online operation, an area where the existing\ntheory prevails the design of structure while lacking clear analytical\nunderstandings about tuning of the gains and the uncertainty model basis\nfunctions that govern the performance characteristics. Numerical experiments on\naerospace applications illustrate the utility of the structured nonlinear\ncontroller optimisation framework.",

Assessment of the quality of images in such scenarios becomes of\nparticular interest. Subjective evaluation in most of the scenarios becomes\ninfeasible so objective evaluation is preferred. Among the three objective\nquality measures, full-reference and reduced-reference methods require an\noriginal image in some form to calculate the quality score which is not\nfeasible in scenarios such as broadcasting or IP video. Therefore, a\nnon-reference quality metric is proposed to assess the quality of digital\nimages which calculates luminance and multiscale gradient statistics along with\nmean subtracted contrast normalized products as features to train a Feedforward\nNeural Network with Scaled Conjugate Gradient. The trained network has provided\ngood regression and R2 measures and further testing on LIVE Image Quality\nAssessment database release-2 has shown promising results.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this study, the effects of prepreg out time on the mechanical and fracture\nproperties of Discontinuous Fiber Composites (DFCs) are investigated. Carbon\nfiber prepregs are aged at 0x, 1x, 2x, and 3x the out life in an environmental\nchamber at constant temperature and humidity. Degree of cure is measured via\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) while tension, compression, and shear\ntests are performed to investigate the effects that aging has on these\nmechanical properties. For the first time, Mode I intra-laminar fracture and\nits size effect are also investigated by means of fracture tests on\ngeometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Tension (SENT) specimens.\nFrom the tension, compression, and shear experiments it is seen that the out\ntime has no effect on the elastic moduli. However, the strength increases with\nincreasing age of the specimens for all the loading conditions. The percent\nincrease compared to the non-aged material ranges from 15% to 33%. This is\nlikely caused by plasticization of the matrix with age, allowing for higher\nenergy absorption.\nMore complex trends are reported for the SENT specimens for all the sizes. It\nis found that the fracture energy and characteristic length initially decrease\nwith age, and then finally increase for the longest out time. This trend is\nowed to two factors with countering effects on the fracture behavior: 1) the\nincrease of the average number of platelets with increasing aging due to\nincrease in resin viscosity, and 2) the plasticization of the matrix with\naging.\nThe results from this study suggest that Discontinuous Fiber Composites\n(DFCs) made from reused materials can have equal, if not better, performance\nthan non-aged DFCs. The experimental data presented in this work can be used as\na baseline to design DFC composite components made from repurposed prepreg\nscrap and waste.",

Especially in the context of optimization approaches this\nknowledge is crucial in order to realize an efficient design process and\nachieve high-performing results. Information theory provides powerful tools to\ninvestigate these relationships because measures are model-free and thus also\ncapture non-linear relationships, while requiring only minimal assumptions on\nthe input data. We therefore propose to use recently introduced\ninformation-theoretic methods and estimation algorithms to find the most\ninfluential input parameters in optimization results. The proposed methods are\nin particular able to account for interactions between parameters, which are\noften neglected but may lead to redundant or synergistic contributions of\nmultiple parameters. We demonstrate the application of these methods on\noptimization data from aerospace engineering, where we first identify the most\nrelevant optimization parameters using a recently introduced\ninformation-theoretic feature-selection algorithm that accounts for\ninteractions between parameters. Second, we use the novel partial information\ndecomposition (PID) framework that allows to quantify redundant and synergistic\ncontributions between selected parameters with respect to the optimization\noutcome to identify parameter interactions. We thus demonstrate the power of\nnovel information-theoretic approaches in identifying relevant parameters in\noptimization runs and highlight how these methods avoid the selection of\nredundant parameters, while detecting interactions that result in synergistic\ncontributions of multiple parameters.",

This paper proposes that system output\nmeasurements, described by a convolutional neural network model of normality,\nare prioritised in real-time for the attention of preventative maintenance\ndecision makers.\nDue to the complexity of gas turbine engine time-varying behaviours, deriving\naccurate physical models is difficult, and often leads to models with low\nprediction accuracy and incompatibility with real-time execution.

It is a challenge to effectively utilize\nthe cross-modality information from multi-source remote sensing images,\nespecially from optical and synthetic aperture radar images, to achieve all-day\nand all-weather detection with high accuracy and speed. Towards this end, a\nfast multi-source fusion detection framework is proposed in current paper.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work aims to provide an engagement decision support tool for Beyond\nVisual Range (BVR) air combat in the context of Defensive Counter Air (DCA)\nmissions. In BVR air combat, engagement decision refers to the choice of the\nmoment the pilot engages a target by assuming an offensive stance and executing\ncorresponding maneuvers. To model this decision, we use the Brazilian Air\nForce's Aerospace Simulation Environment (Ambiente de Simula\u00e7\u00e3o\nAeroespacial - ASA in Portuguese), which generated 3,729 constructive\nsimulations lasting 12 minutes each and a total of 10,316 engagements. We\nanalyzed all samples by an operational metric called the DCA index, which\nrepresents, based on the experience of subject matter experts, the degree of\nsuccess in this type of mission. This metric considers the distances of the\naircraft of the same team and the opposite team, the point of Combat Air\nPatrol, and the number of missiles used. By defining the engagement status\nright before it starts and the average of the DCA index throughout the\nengagement, we create a supervised learning model to determine the quality of a\nnew engagement. An algorithm based on decision trees, working with the XGBoost\nlibrary, provides a regression model to predict the DCA index with a\ncoefficient of determination close to 0.8 and a Root Mean Square Error of 0.05\nthat can furnish parameters to the BVR pilot to decide whether or not to\nengage. Thus, using data obtained through simulations, this work contributes by\nbuilding a decision support system based on machine learning for BVR air\ncombat.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Verification of complex, safety-critical systems is a significant challenge.\nManual testing and simulations are often used, but are only capable of\nexploring a subset of the system's reachable states. Formal methods are\nmathematically-based techniques for the specification and development of\nsoftware, which can provide proofs of properties and exhaustive checks over a\nsystem's state space. In this paper, we present a formal requirements-driven\nmethodology, applied to a model of an aircraft engine controller that has been\nprovided by our industrial partner. Our methodology begins by formalising the\ncontroller's natural-language requirements using the (pre-existing) Formal\nRequirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), iteratively, in consultation with our\nindustry partner. Once formalised, FRET can automatically translate the\nrequirements to enable their verification alongside a Simulink model of the\naircraft engine controller; the requirements can also guide formal verification\nusing other approaches. These two parallel streams in our methodology seek to\ncombine the results from formal requirements elicitation, classical\nverification approaches, and runtime verification; to support the verification\nof aerospace systems modelled in Simulink, from the requirements phase through\nto execution. Our methodology harnesses the power of formal methods in a way\nthat complements existing verification techniques, and supports the\ntraceability of requirements throughout the verification process. This\nmethodology streamlines the process of developing verifiable aircraft engine\ncontrollers, by ensuring that the requirements are formalised up-front and\nuseable during development. In this paper we give an overview of (FRET),\ndescribe our methodology and work to-date on the formalisation and verification\nof the requirements, and outline future work using our methodology.",

A Warped Frequency Transformation (WFT) is applied\nto the acquired signals using numerically determined phase velocity information\nto compensate for signal dispersion. Whilst powerful, uncertainty between\nmaterial properties cannot completely remove dispersion and hence the close\nintra-element spacing of the array is leveraged to allow for the assumption\nthat each acquired signal is a scaled, translated, and noised copy of its\nadjacent counterparts. Following this, a recursive signal-averaging method\nusing artificial time-locking to denoise the acquired signals by assuming the\npresence of non-correlated, zero mean noise is applied. Unlike the application\nof bandpass filters, the signal-averaging method does not remove potentially\nuseful frequency components.

Pore size intervals that\npromote scattering are first estimated using an established model for the\nradiative contribution to the thermal conductivity of porous insulators.

Optical and electron microscopy, porosimetry and mechanical\ntests are used to characterize the structure and properties of porous\ninsulators prepared with different resin formulations.

However, due to\nthe high dimensionality of the Boltzmann equation, high-resolution simulations\nare often difficult to achieve numerically. The moment method which Grad first\nproposed in 1949 [12] is among popular numerical methods to achieve efficient\nhigh-resolution simulations. We can derive the governing equations in the\nmoment method by taking moments on both sides of the Boltzmann equation, which\neffectively reduces the dimensionality of the problem. However, one of the main\nchallenges is that it leads to an unclosed moment system, and closure is needed\nto obtain a closed moment system. It is truly an art in designing closures for\nmoment systems and has been a significant research field in kinetic theory.\nOther than the traditional human designs of closures, the machine\nlearning-based approach has attracted much attention lately [13, 19]. In this\nwork, we propose a machine learning-based method to derive a moment closure\nmodel for the Boltzmann-BGK equation. In particular, the closure relation is\napproximated by a carefully designed deep neural network that possesses\ndesirable physical invariances, i.e., the Galilean invariance, reflecting\ninvariance, and scaling invariance, inherited from the original Boltzmann-BGK\nequation and playing an important role in the correct simulation of the\nBoltzmann equation. Numerical simulations on the smooth and discontinuous\ninitial condition problems, Sod shock tube problem, and the shock structure\nproblems demonstrate satisfactory numerical performances of the proposed\ninvariance preserving neural closure method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Recently, aerodynamics syllabi have changed in high schools, pilot ground\ntraining, and even undergraduate physics. In contrast, there has been no change\nin the basic theory taught to aeronautical or aerospace engineers. What has\nchanged is technology, both experimentally and computationally. The internet\nand social media have also empowered citizen science such that the deficiencies\nin the legacy physics education around flight and lift are well known. The\nlong-standing equal transit time (ETT) theory to explain lift has been proven\nfalse. If incorrect, why was it ever taught? Through a historical analysis of\nrelevant fluid and aerodynamics literature, this study attempts to explain why\nETT theory is part of our collectively lower-level cognitive understanding of\nlift and flight. It was found that in 1744 D'Alembert himself assumed this to\nbe a feature of moving fluids, and while this initial intuition (ETT 1.0) was\nincorrect, the property of ETT (ETT 2.0) was derived in 1752 when applying\nNewton's laws of motion to fluids. This incorrect result was independently\nconfirmed in 1757 by Euler! The conclusion is that an over simplified treatment\nof fluids predicts ETT, along with no lift and drag. This then leads to the\nopen question, can ETT be taught at an appropriately low level as an\nexplanation for lift?",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The knowledge that an intelligent and autonomous mobile robot has and is able\nto acquire of itself and the environment, namely the situation, limits its\nreasoning, decision-making, and execution skills to efficiently and safely\nperform complex missions. Situational awareness is a basic capability of humans\nthat has been deeply studied in fields like Psychology, Military, Aerospace,\nEducation, etc., but it has barely been considered in robotics, which has\nfocused on ideas such as sensing, perception, sensor fusion, state estimation,\nlocalization and mapping, spatial AI, etc. In our research, we connected the\nbroad multidisciplinary existing knowledge on situational awareness with its\ncounterpart in mobile robotics. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art\nrobotics algorithms, we analyze the situational awareness aspects that have\nbeen covered by them, and we discuss their missing points. We found out that\nthe existing robotics algorithms are still missing manifold important aspects\nof situational awareness. As a consequence, we conclude that these missing\nfeatures are limiting the performance of robotic situational awareness, and\nfurther research is needed to overcome this challenge. We see this as an\nopportunity, and provide our vision for future research on robotic situational\nawareness.",

To achieve these objectives, algorithm design\nchoices for the software developments need to be tested and validated for\nexpected scenarios such as autonomous in-situ resource utilization (ISRU),\nlocalization in challenging environments, and multi-robot coordination.\nHowever, real-world experiments are extremely challenging and limited for\nextraterrestrial environment. Also, realistic simulation demonstrations in\nthese environments are still rare and demanded for initial algorithm testing\ncapabilities. To help some of these needs, the NASA Centennial Challenges\nprogram established the Space Robotics Challenge Phase 2 (SRC2) which consist\nof virtual robotic systems in a realistic lunar simulation environment, where a\ngroup of mobile robots were tasked with reporting volatile locations within a\nglobal map, excavating and transporting these resources, and detecting and\nlocalizing a target of interest. The main goal of this article is to share our\nteam's experiences on the design trade-offs to perform autonomous robotic\noperations in a virtual lunar environment and to share strategies to complete\nthe mission requirements posed by NASA SRC2 competition during the\nqualification round. Of the 114 teams that registered for participation in the\nNASA SRC2, team Mountaineers finished as one of only six teams to receive the\ntop qualification round prize.",

This letter briefly summarizes the efforts of South Korea to\ndeploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system, which is a\nterrestrial low-frequency radio navigation system that can complement GNSSs.\nAfter four years of research and development, the Korean eLoran testbed system\nhas been recently deployed and is operational since June 1, 2021. Although its\ninitial performance at sea is satisfactory, navigation through a narrow\nwaterway is still challenging because a complete survey of the additional\nsecondary factor (ASF), which is the largest source of error for eLoran, is\npractically difficult in a narrow waterway. This letter proposes an alternative\nway to survey the ASF in a narrow waterway and improve the ASF map generation\nmethods. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach was validated\nexperimentally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is emerging as tool for tackling complex control\nand decision-making problems. However, in high-risk environments such as\nhealthcare, manufacturing, automotive or aerospace, it is often challenging to\nbridge the gap between an apparently optimal policy learnt by an agent and its\nreal-world deployment, due to the uncertainties and risk associated with it.\nBroadly speaking RL agents face two kinds of uncertainty, 1. aleatoric\nuncertainty, which reflects randomness or noise in the dynamics of the world,\nand 2. epistemic uncertainty, which reflects the bounded knowledge of the agent\ndue to model limitations and finite amount of information/data the agent has\nacquired about the world. These two types of uncertainty carry fundamentally\ndifferent implications for the evaluation of performance and the level of risk\nor trust. Yet these aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are generally\nconfounded as standard and even distributional RL is agnostic to this\ndifference. Here we propose how a distributional approach (UA-DQN) can be\nrecast to render uncertainties by decomposing the net effects of each\nuncertainty. We demonstrate the operation of this method in grid world examples\nto build intuition and then show a proof of concept application for an RL agent\noperating as a clinical decision support system in critical care",

However, many of these systems also have\nstringent security requirements, and security attacks may impair safety. Given\na TSN-based distributed architecture, a set of applications with tasks and\nmessages, as well as a set of security and redundancy requirements, we are\ninterested to synthesize a system configuration such that the real-time, safety\nand security requirements are upheld. We use the Timed Efficient Stream\nLoss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) low-resource multicast authentication\nprotocol to guarantee the security requirements, and redundant disjunct message\nroutes to tolerate link failures. We consider that tasks are dispatched using a\nstatic cyclic schedule table and that the messages use the time-sensitive\ntraffic class in TSN, which relies on schedule tables (called Gate Control\nLists, GCLs) in the network switches. A configuration consists of the schedule\ntables for tasks as well as the disjoint routes and GCLs for messages. We\npropose a Constraint Programming-based formulation which can be used to find an\noptimal solution with respect to our cost function. Additionally, we propose a\nSimulated Annealing based metaheuristic, which can find good solution for large\ntest cases. We evaluate both approaches on several test cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Thermoset resin-based composite materials are widely used in the aerospace\nindustry, mainly due to their high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight\nratios. A major issue with the use of thermoset resins in fiber composites is\nthe process-induced residual stresses that are formed from resin chemical\nshrinkage during the curing process. These residual stresses within the\ncomposite material ultimately result in reduced durability and residual\ndeformations of the final product. Polybenzoxazine (PBZ) polymer resins have\ndemonstrated near-zero volumetric shrinkage during the curing process. Although\nthe low shrinkage of PBZ is promising in terms of reduced process-induced\nresidual stresses, little is known about the physical causes. In this work,\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed with a reactive force field\nto predict physical properties (gelation point, evolution of network, mass\ndensity, volumetric shrinkage) and mechanical properties (Bulk modulus, Shear\nmodulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, Yield strength) as a function of\ncrosslinking density. The MD modeling procedure is validated herein using\nexperimental measurements of the modeled PBZ resin. The results of this study\nare used to provide a physical understanding of the zero-shrinkage phenomenon\nof PBZ. This information is also a critical input to future process modeling\nefforts for PBZ composites.",
