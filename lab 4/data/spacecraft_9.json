    "abstract": "Abstract:  The exploration of small body asteroids provides direct access to the\nprimitive building blocks of our solar system. Sample and return missions\nenable chemical and radioisotope studies which not only provide evidence for\nthe formation of the solar system, but also a basic understanding of where\nresources might be found for future exploitation. The touch-down and sample\ntechniques established by Hayabusa-2 and OSIRIS-REx accomplish this mission by\nphysically touching down on the asteroid and collecting samples into a basket\nextended via a probe from the bottom of the spacecraft. This technique has been\ndemonstrated to work, but contains a high cost in both mission operations as\nwell as the size and complexity of the collection mechanism itself. This paper\nexplores an alternative sample and return technique by exploiting the recent\ndiscovery of regolith particle ejections from Bennu. Particles ejected from the\nsurface of Bennu are typically 1 cm in size and spend several hours in flight,\nsuggesting the possibility that nanospacecraft deployed from the\nmother-spacecraft could chase down, collect and return with the sample with\nminimal sensor and delta-V capability. Key aspects of this mission are\ndeveloped to reduce risk, and an overall mission concept is developed to\nestablish plausibility.",

Furthermore, the predicted growth\nof the space sector and the planned launch of megaconstellations will add even\nmore complexity, therefore causing the collision risk and the burden on space\noperators to increase. Managing this complex framework with internationally\nagreed methods is pivotal and urgent. In this context, we build a novel\nphysics-based probabilistic generative model for synthetically generating\nconjunction data messages, calibrated using real data. By conditioning on\nobservations, we use the model to obtain posterior distributions via Bayesian\ninference. We show that the probabilistic programming approach to conjunction\nassessment can help in making predictions and in finding the parameters that\nexplain the observed data in conjunction data messages, thus shedding more\nlight on key variables and orbital characteristics that more likely lead to\nconjunction events. Moreover, our technique enables the generation of\nphysically accurate synthetic datasets of collisions, answering a fundamental\nneed of the space and machine learning communities working in this area.",

Yet, access to space remains\na distant dream as there is growing complexity in what is required of\nsatellites and increasing space traffic. Interplanetary exploration is even\nharder and has limited possibilities for low cost mission. All of these factors\nmake even CubeSats, the entry-level standard too expensive for most and\ntherefore a better way needs to be found. The proposed solution in this report\nis a low-mass, low-cost, disposable solution that exploits the latest advances\nin electronics and is relatively easy to integrate: FemtoSats. FemtoSats are\nsub-100-gram spacecraft. The FemtoSat concept is based on launching a swarm\nwhere the main tasks are divided between the members of the swarm. This means\nthat if one fails the swarm can take its place and therefore substitute it\nwithout risking the whole mission. In this paper we explore the utility of\nFemtoSats to perform first exploration and mapping of a Lunar PSR. This concept\nwas recognized as finalist for the NASA BIG Competition in 2020. This is an\nexample of a high-risk, high-reward mission where losing one FemtoSat does not\nmean the mission is in danger as it happens with regular satellite missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On 2020 April 19 a coronal mass ejection (CME) was detected in situ by Solar\nOrbiter at a heliocentric distance of about 0.8 AU. The CME was later observed\nin situ on April 20th by the Wind and BepiColombo spacecraft whilst BepiColombo\nwas located very close to Earth. This CME presents a good opportunity for a\ntriple radial alignment study, as the spacecraft were separated by less than\n5$^\\circ$ in longitude. The source of the CME, which was launched on April\n15th, was an almost entirely isolated streamer blowout. STEREO-A observed the\nevent remotely from -75.1$^\\circ$ longitude, which is an exceptionally well\nsuited viewpoint for heliospheric imaging of an Earth directed CME. The\nconfiguration of the four spacecraft has provided an exceptionally clean link\nbetween remote imaging and in situ observations of the CME. We have used the in\nsitu observations of the CME at Solar Orbiter, Wind, and BepiColombo, and the\nremote observations of the CME at STEREO-A in combination with flux rope models\nto determine the global shape of the CME and its evolution as it propagated\nthrough the inner heliosphere. A clear flattening of the CME cross-section has\nbeen observed by STEREO-A, and further confirmed by comparing profiles of the\nflux rope models to the in situ data, where the distorted flux rope\ncross-section qualitatively agrees most with in situ observations of the\nmagnetic field at Solar Orbiter. Comparing in situ observations of the magnetic\nfield between spacecraft, we find that the dependence of the maximum (mean)\nmagnetic field strength decreases with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.24 \\pm\n0.50}$ ($r^{-1.12 \\pm 0.14}$), in disagreement with previous studies. Further\nassessment of the axial and poloidal magnetic field strength dependencies\nsuggests that the expansion of the CME is likely neither self-similar nor\ncylindrically symmetric.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Satellite for Orbital Aerodynamics Research (SOAR) is a CubeSat mission,\ndue to be launched in 2021, to investigate the interaction between different\nmaterials and the atmospheric flow regime in very low Earth orbits (VLEO).\nImproving knowledge of the gas-surface interactions at these altitudes and\nidentification of novel materials that can minimise drag or improve aerodynamic\ncontrol are important for the design of future spacecraft that can operate in\nlower altitude orbits. Such satellites may be smaller and cheaper to develop or\ncan provide improved Earth observation data or communications link-budgets and\nlatency. Using precise orbit and attitude determination information and the\nmeasured atmospheric flow characteristics the forces and torques experienced by\nthe satellite in orbit can be studied and estimates of the aerodynamic\ncoefficients calculated. This paper presents the scientific concept and design\nof the SOAR mission. The methodology for recovery of the aerodynamic\ncoefficients from the measured orbit, attitude, and in-situ atmospheric data\nusing a least-squares orbit determination and free-parameter fitting process is\ndescribed and the experimental uncertainty of the resolved aerodynamic\ncoefficients is estimated. The presented results indicate that the combination\nof the satellite design and experimental methodology are capable of clearly\nillustrating the variation of drag and lift coefficient for differing surface\nincidence angle. The lowest uncertainties for the drag coefficient measurement\nare found at approximately 300 km, whilst the measurement of lift coefficient\nimproves for reducing orbital altitude to 200 km.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Measuring the abundance and isotopic composition of noble gases in planetary\natmospheres can answer fundamental questions in cosmochemistry and comparative\nplanetology. However, noble gases are rare elements, a feature making their\nmeasurement challenging even on Earth. Furthermore, in space applications,\npower consumption, volume and mass constraints on spacecraft instrument\naccommodations require the development of compact innovative instruments able\nto meet the engineering requirements of the mission while still meeting the\nscience requirements. Here we demonstrate the ability of the quadrupole ion\ntrap mass spectrometer (QITMS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(Caltech, Pasadena) to measure low quantities of heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) in\nstatic operating mode and in the absence of a buffer gas such as helium. The\nsensitivity reaches 1E13 cps Torr-1 (about 1011 cps/Pa) of gas (Kr or Xe). The\ninstrument is able to measure gas in static mode for extended periods of time\n(up to 48 h) enabling the acquisition of thousands of isotope ratios per\nmeasurement. Errors on isotope ratios follow predictions of the counting\nstatistics and the instrument provides reproducible results over several days\nof measurements. For example, 1.7E-10 Torr (2.3E-8 Pa) of Kr measured\ncontinuously for 7 hours yielded a 0.6 permil precision on the 86Kr/84Kr ratio.\nMeasurements of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples reproduce values from\nthe literature. A compact instrument based upon the QITMS design would have a\nsensitivity high enough to reach the precision on isotope ratios (e.g. better\nthan 1 percent for 129,131-136Xe/130Xe ratios) necessary for a scientific\npayload measuring noble gases collected in the Venus atmosphere.",

The\nphysical properties from the polyhedral shape of the target are derived\nassigning each tetrahedron to a point mass in its center. That considerably\nreduces the computation processing time compared to previous methods to\nevaluate the gravitational potential. The surfaces of section close to Apophis\nare build considering or not the gravitational perturbations of the Sun, the\nplanets, and the SRP. The Earth is the one that most affects the invisticated\nregion making the vast majority of the orbits to collide or escape from the\nsystem. Moreover, from numerical analysis of orbits started on March 1, 2029,\nthe less perturbed region is characterized by the variation of the semimajor\naxis of 40-days orbits, which do not exceed 2 km very close to the central body\n($a < 4$ km, $e < 0.4$). However, no regions investigated could be a possible\noption for inserting a spacecraft into natural orbits around Apophis during the\nclose approach with our planet. Finally, to solve the stabilization problem in\nthe system, we apply a robust path following control law to control the orbital\ngeometry of a spacecraft. At last, we present an example of successful\noperation of our orbit control with a total $\\bigtriangleup v$ of 0.495 m/s for\n60 days. All our results are gathered in the CPM-ASTEROID database, which will\nbe regularly updated by considering other asteroids.",

These data were\nobtained as part of an international ground-based observing campaign in support\nof the Juno mission using the NMSU Acousto-optic Imaging Camera (NAIC) at the\n3.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, NM. We find that the\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e model cloud layering scheme can reproduce Jupiter's\nvisible spectrum both with the Carlson et al.

While the\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e model provides reasonable results for regions of Jupiter's\ncloud bands such as the North Equatorial Belt and Equatorial Zone, we find that\nit is not a safe assumption for unique weather events, such as the 2016-2017\nSouthern Equatorial Belt outbreak that was captured by our measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This review article summarizes the advancement in the studies of\nEarth-affecting solar transients in the last decade that encompasses most of\nsolar cycle 24. The Sun Earth is an integrated physical system in which the\nspace environment of the Earth sustains continuous influence from mass,\nmagnetic field and radiation energy output of the Sun in varying time scales\nfrom minutes to millennium. This article addresses short time scale events,\nfrom minutes to days that directly cause transient disturbances in the Earth\nspace environment and generate intense adverse effects on advanced\ntechnological systems of human society. Such transient events largely fall into\nthe following four types: (1) solar flares, (2) coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\nincluding their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, (3) solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events, and (4) stream interaction regions (SIRs) including corotating\ninteraction regions (CIRs). In the last decade, the unprecedented multi\nviewpoint observations of the Sun from space, enabled by STEREO Ahead/Behind\nspacecraft in combination with a suite of observatories along the Sun-Earth\nlines, have provided much more accurate and global measurements of the size,\nspeed, propagation direction and morphology of CMEs in both 3-D and over a\nlarge volume in the heliosphere. Several advanced MHD models have been\ndeveloped to simulate realistic CME events from the initiation on the Sun until\ntheir arrival at 1 AU. Much progress has been made on detailed kinematic and\ndynamic behaviors of CMEs, including non-radial motion, rotation and\ndeformation of CMEs, CME-CME interaction, and stealth CMEs and problematic\nICMEs. The knowledge about SEPs has also been significantly improved.",

However, since their formation 4.5 Gy ago, they have been altered\nby different processes. While not exposed to much electromagnetic radiation,\nthey experience intense particle radiation. Galactic cosmic rays and solar\nenergetic particles have a broad spectrum of energies and interact with the\ncometary surface and subsurface; they are the main source of space weathering\nfor a comet in the Kuiper Belt or in the Oort cloud; and also affect the ice\nprior to the comet agglomeration. While low energy particles interact only with\nthe cometary surface, the most energetic ones deposit a significant amount of\nenergy down to tens of meters. This interaction can modify the isotopic ratios\nin cometary ices and create secondary compounds through radiolysis, such as O2\nand H2O2 (paper II: Maggiolo et al., 2020). In this paper, we model the energy\ndeposition of energetic particles as a function of depth using a Geant4\napplication modified to account for the isotope creation process. We quantify\nthe energy deposited in cometary nucleus by galactic cosmic rays and solar\nenergetic particles. The consequences of the energy deposition on the isotopic\nand chemical composition of cometary ices and their implication on the\ninterpretation of cometary observations, notably of 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko\nby the ESA/Rosetta spacecraft, will be discussed in Paper II.",

The problem is referred to as the lunar farside highlands problem. In\nthis article, the author deduces the center of mass shift of the moon from its\ngeometrical center and the difference in crustal thickness between the far and\nnear lunar sides necessary to explain it. Although there have been other\ntheories proposed to explain these phenomena, this theory explains them as\narising naturally from the effects on lunar material due to the earth's\nexternal gravity force and the moon's synchronous rotation and revolution. The\nauthor's mathematical model results in a calculated value of 1.6 km for the\ncenter of mass shift and a crustal thickness difference of 16 km. The author's\ndeduced values of center of mass shift and crustal thickness difference are\nclose to within about 5 to 10% of their accepted values. One unexpected and\ndeducible result of the author's theory is that the center of mass shift of the\nmoon is decreasing towards moon center under lunar recession at the current\nrate of about 1.6 x 10-4 mm/yr.",

We also take this as an\nopportunity to present a novel Bayesian spectral inversion framework for\nreflectance spectroscopy. We first validate this framework using simulated\nspectra of amorphous and crystalline ice mixtures and a laboratory spectrum of\ncrystalline ice. We next analyze the JIRAM data and, through Bayesian model\ncomparisons, find that a two-component intimately mixed model (TC-IM model) of\namorphous and crystalline ice is strongly preferred (at 26{\\sigma} confidence)\nover a two-component model of the same species but where their spectra are\nareally/linearly mixed. We also find that the TC-IM model is strongly preferred\n(at > 30{\\sigma} confidence) over single-component models with only amorphous\nor crystalline ice, indicating the presence of both these phases of water ice\nin the data. For the highest SNR estimates of the JIRAM data, the TC-IM model\nsolution corresponds to a mixture with a very large number density fraction\n(99.952 +/- 0.001 \\%) of small (23.12 +/- 1.01 microns) amorphous ice grains,\nand a very small fraction (0.048 +/- 0.001 \\%) of large (565.34 +/- 1.01\nmicrons) crystalline ice grains. The overabundance of small amorphous ice\ngrains we find is consistent with previous studies. The maximum-likelihood\nspectrum of the TC-IM model, however, is in tension with the data in the\nregions around 2.5 and 3.6 {\\mu}m, and indicates the presence of non-ice\ncomponents not currently included in our model, primarily due to the limited\navailability of cryogenic optical constants.",

The CME trajectory was determined using the\nmethod described in Liewer et al. (2020) and verified using simultaneous images\nof the CME propagation from STEREO-A. The fortuitous alignment with STEREO-A\nalso provided views of coronal activity leading up to the eruption.\nObservations from SDO, in conjunction with potential magnetic field models of\nthe corona, were used to analyze the coronal magnetic evolution for the three\ndays leading up to the flux rope ejection from the corona on 25 January.\nResults: We found that the 25 January CME is likely the end result of a slow\nmagnetic flux rope eruption that began on 23 January and was observed by\nSTEREO-A/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI). Analysis of these observations\nsuggest that the flux rope was apparently constrained in the corona for more\nthan a day before its final ejection on 25 January. STEREO-A/COR2 observations\nof swelling and brightening of the overlying streamer for several hours prior\nto eruption on January 25 led us to classify this as a streamer-blowout CME.\nThe analysis of the SDO data suggests that restructuring of the coronal\nmagnetic fields caused by an emerging active region led to the final ejection\nof the flux rope.",

This moving Type IV burst was associated with a coronal\nmass ejection (CME) propagating in the southwest direction with a speed of 1570\nkm/s. The maximum radio flux of this burst was about 300 s.f.u. and the\npolarization was more than 40%. In the frequency range of 8-33 MHz it continued\nfor more than 2 hr.

This moving Type IV burst was\nobserved by STEREO A at frequencies of 5-15 MHz in spite of the low sensitivity\nof STEREO A.

The demand for greater attitude pointing precision,\nattitude maneuvering or recovery with the increased use of lightweight and\nflexible materials necessitates the consideration of flexible dynamics in the\ncontrol strategy. These highly nonlinear dynamics which increase the order of\nthe system are extremely difficult to model with high degree of accuracy. A\ngeneral model for attitude and flexible dynamics for a class of spacecraft is\nhence derived in detail based on the so-called hybrid coordinates approach. The\nspacecraft considered has a star topology with a rigid central bus and flexible\nplate-type appendages. Given that the flexible spacecraft is under-actuated,\nthe input-output feedback linearization technique is specifically used to\npartition the system into two distinct parts, namely an external linear system\nand an internal unobservable nonlinear system. A general internal/zero dynamics\ntheorem for a class of nonlinear systems is proved and then applied to a\nflexible spacecraft which results in a linear asymptotically stable zero\ndynamics. The overall closed-loop stability of the flexible spacecraft is also\nanalyzed rigorously and shown to be locally asymptotically stable using the\nLyapunov theory. The robustness of the controller against modeling and\nparametric uncertainties is examined through extensive numerical simulations.\nOverall, the feedback linearization control scheme has been proven to be\nfeasible and efficient for the attitude recovery of a spacecraft and has also\nbecome front and center in other application areas in the recent years.",

In\nthis study, we investigate for the first time the radiation belt response to an\nFRS impact using multi-satellite observations and numerical simulations.\nSpacecraft on the dayside observed decreases in magnetic field strength and\nenergetic (~ 40-475 keV) particle fluxes.

Particles with different energies vary simultaneously at each\nspacecraft, implying a non-dispersive particle response to the shock.\nSpacecraft located at lower L-shells did not record any significant signatures.\nThe observations indicate a local time dependence of the response associated\nwith the shock inclination, with the clearest signatures being observed in the\ndusk-midnight sector. Simulations underestimate the amplitude of the magnetic\nfield variations observed on the nightside. The observed decreases in the\nelectron intensities result from a combination of radial gradient and adiabatic\neffects. The radial gradients in the spectral index appear to be the dominant\ncontributor to the observed variations of electrons seen on the dayside (near\nnoon and dusk) and on the nightside (near midnight). This study shows that even\nan FRS can affect the radiation belts significantly and provides an opportunity\nto understand their dynamic response to a sudden expansion of the\nmagnetosphere.",

It is also aimed to set the near real-time particle observation\nrequirements to disentangle the role of long and short-term variations of the\nGCR flux to evaluate the performance of high-sensitivity instruments in space\nsuch as the future interferometers for gravitational wave detection. Finally,\nthe association between recurrent GCR flux variation observations in L1 and\nweak to moderate geomagnetic activity in 2016-2017 is discussed. Short-term\nrecurrent GCR flux variations are good proxies of recurrent geomagnetic\nactivity when the B$_z$ component of the IP magnetic field is directed\nnorthern.",

The crust is thin below\nthe magnesium-poor Northern Volcanic Plains whereas the thickest crust is found\nin the magnesium-rich region located at mid-northern latitudes in the Western\nHemisphere. The magnesium-rich region is thus not due to an early impact but\nrather to extensive mantle melting.

These solutions, which\ntransit close to the Lagrangian points $L_1,L_2$ of the CRTBP, have been\nclassified using the values of approximate local integrals and of the Jacobi\nconstant. The use for small bodies of the Solar System requires to consider a\nhierarchical extension of the model, from the CRTBP to the the full $N$\nplanetary problem. The Elliptic Restricted Three Body, which is the first\nnatural extension of the CRTBP, represents already a challenge, since global\nfirst integrals such as the Jacobi constant are not known for this problem. In\nthis paper we extend the classification of the transits occurring close to the\nLagrangian points $L_1,L_2$ of the ERTBP using a combination of the Floquet\ntheory and Birkhoff normalizations. Provided that certain non-resonance\nconditions are satisfied, we conjugate the Hamiltonian of the problem to an\nintegrable normal form Hamiltonian with remainder, which is used to define\napproximate local first integrals and to classify the transits of orbits\nthrough a neighbourhood of the Lagrange equilibria according to the values of\nthese integrals.

Previous observations provide diverse results and the\nstructure function analyses are also reported to be an approach to investigate\nthe scaling anisotropy based on a local magnetic field. However, the\ndetermination of the sampling angle with respect to the local background\nmagnetic field requires that the observed time series for the average are time\nstationary. Whether or not this required time stationarity is compatible with\nthe measurements has not been investigated. Here we utilize the second-order\nstructure function method to study the scaling anisotropy with a\ntime-stationary background field.We analyze 88 fast solar wind intervals each\nwith time durations larger than 2 days measured by WIND spacecraft in the\nperiod 2005-2018. We calculate the local magnetic field as the average of the\ntime series B whose time stationarity is fulfilled by our criterion phi smaller\nthan 10 deg (phi is the angle between the two averaged magnetic fields after\ncutting B into two halves). We find for the first time the isotropic scaling\nfeature of the magnetic-trace structure functions with scaling indices -0.63 pm\n0.08 and -0.70 pm 0.04, respectively, with the local magnetic field parallel\nand perpendicular to the solar wind velocity directions. The scaling for the\nvelocity-trace structure functions is also isotropic and the indices are -0.47\npm 0.10 and -0.51 pm 0.09. We also find that with increasing phi threshold to\n90 deg, the scaling index of the magnetic-trace structure function in the\nparallel direction decreases to -0.81, while the rms of the instantaneous angle\nbetween magnetic field and solar wind velocity increases up to 45deg at the\ntimescale 150 s, indicating a mix of perpendicular measurements into parallel\nones at large scales.",

They are considered\nto be important because of their role in the dissipation of the injection\nenergy and their potential for significant particle scattering and\nacceleration. Kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves are observed to be excited during\nenergetic particle injections, and are typically present in conjunction with\nTDS observations. Despite the availability of a large number of spacecraft\nobservations, the origin of TDSs and their relation to kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves\nremains poorly understood to date. Part of the difficulty arises from the vast\nscale separations between kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves and TDSs. Here, we demonstrate\nthat TDSs can be excited by electrons in nonlinear Landau resonance with\nkinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves. These electrons get trapped by the parallel electric\nfield of kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves, form localized beam distributions, and\nsubsequently generate TDSs through beam instabilities. A big picture emerges as\nfollows: macroscale dipolarization fronts first transfer the ion flow (kinetic)\nenergy to kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves at intermediate scale, which further channel\nthe energy to TDSs at the microscale and eventually deposit the energy to the\nthermal electrons in the form of heating. In this way, the ion flow energy\nassociated with dipolarization fronts is effectively dissipated in a cascade\nfrom large to small scales in the inner magnetosphere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Multi-rendezvous spacecraft trajectory optimization problems are notoriously\ndifficult to solve. For this reason, the design space is usually pruned by\nusing heuristics and past experience. As an alternative, the current research\nexplores some properties of $\\Delta V$ matrices which provide the minimum\n$\\Delta V$ values for a transfer between two celestial bodies for various times\nof departure and transfer duration values. These can assist in solving\nmulti-rendezvous problems in an automated way. The paper focuses on the problem\nof, given a set of candidate objects, how to find the sequence of $N$ objects\nto rendezvous with that minimizes the total $\\Delta V$ required. Transfers are\nconsidered as single algebraic objects corresponding to $\\Delta V$ matrices,\nwhich allow intuitive concatenation via a generalized summation. Waiting times,\nboth due to mission requirements and prospects for cheaper and faster future\ntransfers, are also incorporated in the $\\Delta V$ matrices. A transcription of\nthe problem as a shortest path search on a graph can utilize a range of\navailable efficient shortest path solvers. Given an efficient $\\Delta V$ matrix\nestimator, the new paradigm proposed here is believed to offer an alternative\nto the pruning techniques currently used.",

To our\nknowledge, a quantitative study on the aliasing effects as well as the geometry\nof the first-Brillouin-like zone for the constellation with more than 4\nspacecraft has not been proposed yet. Herewith we provide a method to estimate\nand compare the geometry of the first-Brillouin-like zone in multi-spacecraft\nconstellations. The corresponding array of reciprocal lattice in the wavevector\nspace forms the Brillouin zone.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context. We study two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed between April\n1-2, 2019 by both the inner Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR-I)\nand the inner heliospheric imager (HI-1) on board STEREO-A. This is the first\nstudy of CME observations from two viewpoints in similar directions but at\nconsiderably different solar distances. Aims. Our objective is to understand\nhow the PSP observations affect the CME kinematics, especially due to its\nproximity to the Sun. Methods. We estimate the CME positions, speeds,\naccelerations, propagation directions and longitudinal deflections using\nimaging observations from two spacecraft, and a set of analytical expressions\nthat consider the CME as a point structure and take into account the rapid\nchange in spacecraft position. Results. We find that both CMEs are slow ($<\n400\\ km\\ s^{-1}$), propagating eastward of the Sun-Earth line. The second CME\nseems to accelerate between $\\sim 0.1$ to $\\sim 0.2\\ au$ and deflect westward\nwith an angular speed consistent with the solar rotation speed. We find some\ndiscrepancies in the CME solar distance (up to $0.05\\ au$, particularly for CME\n\\#1), latitude (up to $\\sim10^{\\circ}$) and longitude (up to $24^{\\circ}$) when\ncomparing results from different fit cases (different observations or set of\nfree parameters). Conclusions. Discrepancies in longitude are likely due to the\nfeature tracked visually rather than instrumental biases or fit assumptions.\nFor similar reasons, the CME \\#1 solar distance, as derived from WISPR-I\nobservations, is larger than the HI-1 result, regardless of the fit parameters\nconsidered. Error estimates for CME kinematics do not show any clear trend\nassociated to the observing instrument. The source region location and the lack\nof any clear in situ counterparts (both at near-Earth and at PSP) support our\nestimate of the propagation direction for both events.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Dynamic Uncertain Causality Graph(DUCG) is a recently proposed model for\ndiagnoses of complex systems. It performs well for industry system such as\nnuclear power plants, chemical system and spacecrafts. However, the variable\nstate combination explosion in some cases is still a problem that may result in\ninefficiency or even disability in DUCG inference. In the situation of clinical\ndiagnoses, when a lot of intermediate causes are unknown while the downstream\nresults are known in a DUCG graph, the combination explosion may appear during\nthe inference computation. Monte Carlo sampling is a typical algorithm to solve\nthis problem. However, we are facing the case that the occurrence rate of the\ncase is very small, e.g. $10^{-20}$, which means a huge number of samplings are\nneeded. This paper proposes a new scheme based on conditional stochastic\nsimulation which obtains the final result from the expectation of the\nconditional probability in sampling loops instead of counting the sampling\nfrequency, and thus overcomes the problem. As a result, the proposed algorithm\nrequires much less time than the DUCG recursive inference algorithm presented\nearlier. Moreover, a simple analysis of convergence rate based on a designed\nexample is given to show the advantage of the proposed method. % In addition,\nsupports for logic gate, logic cycles, and parallelization, which exist in\nDUCG, are also addressed in this paper. The new algorithm reduces the time\nconsumption a lot and performs 3 times faster than old one with 2.7% error\nratio in a practical graph for Viral Hepatitis B.",

This is in stark contrast to\nthe shapes of asteroids of similar sizes, of which ~14% are bilobate. This\nsuggests that a process or mechanism unique to comets is producing these\nshapes. Here we show that the bilobate shapes of JFC nuclei are a natural\nbyproduct of sublimative activity during their dynamical migration from their\ntrans-Neptunian reservoir, through the Centaur population, and into the Jupiter\nfamily. We model the torques resulting from volatile sublimation during this\ndynamical migration and find that they tend to spin up these nuclei to\ndisruption. Once disrupted, the rubble pile-like material properties of comet\nnuclei (tensile strengths of ~1-10 Pa and internal friction angles of\n~35$^\\circ$) cause them to reform as bilobate objects. We find that JFCs likely\nexperienced rotational disruption events prior to entering the Jupiter family,\nwhich could explain the prevalence of bilobate shapes. These results suggest\nthat the bilobate shapes of observed comets developed recently in their history\n(within the past ~1-10 Myr), rather than during solar system formation or\ncollisions during planet migration and residency in the trans-Neptunian\npopulation.",

Ceres' low reflectance\nrequires dark phases, which were assumed to be amorphous carbon and/or\nmagnetite (~80 wt.%). In contrast, the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND)\nconstrained the abundances of C (8-14 wt.%) and Fe (15-17 wt.%). Here, we\nreconcile the VIR-derived mineral composition with the GRaND-derived elemental\ncomposition. First, we model mineral abundances from VIR data, including either\nmeteorite-derived insoluble organic matter, amorphous carbon, magnetite, or\ncombination as the darkening agent and provide statistically rigorous error\nbars from a Bayesian algorithm combined with a radiative-transfer model.\nElemental abundances of C and Fe are much higher than is suggested by the GRaND\nobservations for all models satisfying VIR data. We then show that radiative\ntransfer modeling predicts higher reflectance from a carbonaceous chondrite of\nknown composition than its measured reflectance. Consequently, our second\nmodels use multiple carbonaceous chondrite endmembers, allowing for the\npossibility that their specific textures or minerals other than carbon or\nmagnetite act as darkening agents, including sulfides and tochilinite. Unmixing\nmodels with carbonaceous chondrites eliminate the discrepancy in elemental\nabundances of C and Fe. Ceres' average reflectance spectrum and elemental\nabundances are best reproduced by carbonaceous-chondrite-like materials (40-70\nwt.%), IOM or amorphous carbon (10 wt.%), magnetite (3-8 wt.%), serpentine\n(10-25 wt.%), carbonates (4-12 wt.%), and NH4-bearing phyllosilicates (1-11\nwt.%).",

Furthermore, of the ten\ncomponents of a body's quadrupole moment, four are found to be irrelevant, two\ncan affect only the force, and the remaining four can affect both forces and\ntorques. As an application, we consider the capabilities of a hypothetical\nspacecraft which controls its motion by controlling its internal structure.

The GPD allows simultaneous\nmeasurements of the interaction point, energy, arrival time, and polarization\nangle of detected X-ray photons. The increase in sensitivity, achieved 40 years\nago, for imaging and spectroscopy with the Einstein satellite will thus be\nextended to X-ray polarimetry for the first time.
