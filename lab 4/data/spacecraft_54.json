    "abstract": "Abstract:  In the last four decades it has been observed that solar flares show\nquasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) from the lowest, i.e. radio, to the highest,\ni.e. gamma-ray, part of the electromagnetic spectrum. To this day, it is still\nunclear which mechanism creates such QPPs. In this paper, we analyze four\nbright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behavior\nand were observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (\\gbm) onboard the Fermi\nsatellite. Because GBM covers over 3 decades in energy (8 keV to 40 MeV) it can\nbe a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solar\nflares. We tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flares\nobserved by GBM by applying a classical periodogram analysis. However, contrary\nto previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating the\npower spectral density spectrum (PSD). To assess the significance of the\nfrequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for X-ray\nbinaries and Seyfert galaxies. This technique takes into account the underlying\ncontinuum of the PSD which for all of these sources has a P(f) ~ f^{-\\alpha}\ndependence and is typically labeled red-noise. We checked the reliability of\nthis technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the Reuven\nRamaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) which contains, besides\nany potential periodicity from the Sun, a 4 s rotational period due to the\nrotation of the spacecraft around its axis. While we do not find an intrinsic\nsolar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.\nMoreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant QPPs in\nthe four bright solar flares observed by GBM. We stress that for the purpose of\nsuch kind of analyses it is of uttermost importance to appropriately account\nfor the red-noise component in the PSD of these astrophysical sources.",

This mission, under a Phase 0 study performed by\nCNES, will aim at Neptune and Triton. Two sets of objectives will be pursued.\nThe first one is to perform a set of gravitation experiments at the Solar\nSystem scale. Experimental tests of gravitation have always shown good\nagreement with General Relativity. There are however drivers to continue\ntesting General Relativity, and to do so at the largest possible scales. From a\ntheoretical point of view, Einstein's theory of gravitation shows\ninconsistencies with a quantum description of Nature and unified theories\npredict deviations from General Relativity. From an observational point of\nview, as long as dark matter and dark energy are not observed through other\nmeans than their gravitational effects, they can be considered as a\nmanifestation of a modification of General Relativity at cosmic scales. The\nscientific objectives are to: (i) test the gravitation law at the Solar System\nscale; (ii) measure the Eddington parameter; and (iii) investigate the\nnavigation anomalies during fly-bys. To fulfil these objectives, the following\ncomponents are to be on board the spacecraft: (i) the Gravity Advanced Package\n(GAP), which is an electrostatic accelerometer to which a rotating stage is\nadded; (ii) radio-science; (iii) laser ranging, to improve significantly the\nmeasure of the Eddington parameter. The second set of objectives is to enhance\nour knowledge of Neptune and Triton. Several instruments dedicated to\nplanetology are foreseen: camera, spectrometer, dust and particle detectors,\nand magnetometer. Depending on the ones kept, the mission could provide\ninformation on the gravity field, the atmosphere and the magnetosphere of the\ntwo bodies as well as on the surface geology of Triton and on the nature of the\nplanetary rings around Neptune.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context. Ceres is the most massive body of the asteroid belt and contains\nabout 25 wt.% (weight percent) of water. Understanding its thermal evolution\nand assessing its current state are major goals of the Dawn Mission.\nConstraints on internal structure can be inferred from various observations.\nEspecially, detailed knowledge of the rotational motion can help constrain the\nmass distribution inside the body, which in turn can lead to information on its\ngeophysical history. Aims. We investigate the signature of the interior on the\nrotational motion of Ceres and discuss possible future measurements performed\nby the spacecraft Dawn that will help to constrain Ceres' internal structure.\nMethods. We compute the polar motion, precession-nutation, and length-of-day\nvariations. We estimate the amplitudes of the rigid and non-rigid response for\nthese various motions for models of Ceres interior constrained by recent shape\ndata and surface properties. Results. As a general result, the amplitudes of\noscillations in the rotation appear to be small, and their determination from\nspaceborne techniques will be challenging. For example, the amplitudes of the\nsemi-annual and annual nutations are around ~364 and ~140 milli-arcseconds, and\nthey show little variation within the parametric space of interior models\nenvisioned for Ceres. This, combined with the very long-period of the\nprecession motion, requires very precise measurements. We also estimate the\ntimescale for Ceres' orientation to relax to a generalized Cassini State, and\nwe find that the tidal dissipation within that object was probably too small to\ndrive any significant damping of its obliquity since formation. However,\ncombining the shape and gravity observations by Dawn offers the prospect to\nidentify departures of non-hydrostaticity at the global and regional scale,\nwhich will be instrumental in constraining Ceres' past and current thermal\nstate. We also discuss the existence of a possible Chandler mode in the\nrotational motion of Ceres, whose potential excitation by endogenic and/or\nexogenic processes may help detect the presence of liquid reservoirs within the\nasteroid.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We employ a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique, for the first\ntime to study the kinematics of six coronal mass ejections (CMEs), using images\nobtained from the COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs on board the twin STEREO\nspacecraft, as also the eruptive prominences (EPs) associated with three of\nthem using images from the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI). A feature in the\nEPs and leading edges (LEs) of all the CMEs was identified and tracked in\nimages from the two spacecraft, and a stereoscopic reconstruction technique was\nused to determine the 3D coordinates of these features. True velocity and\nacceleration were determined from the temporal evolution of the true height of\nthe CME features. Our study of kinematics of the CMEs in 3D reveals that the\nCME leading edge undergoes maximum acceleration typically below 2R$_\\{odot}$.\nThe acceleration profiles of CMEs associated with flares and prominences\nexhibit different behaviour. While the CMEs not associated with prominences\nshow a bimodal acceleration profile, those associated with prominences do not.\nTwo of the three associated prominences in the study show a high and rising\nvalue of acceleration up to a distance of almost 4R$_\\{odot}$ but acceleration\nof the corresponding CME LE does not show the same behaviour, suggesting that\nthe two may not be always driven by the same mechanism. One of the CMEs,\nalthough associated with a C-class flare showed unusually high acceleration of\nover 1500 m s$^{-2}$. Our results therefore suggest that only the\nflare-associated CMEs undergo residual acceleration, which indicates that the\nflux injection theoretical model holds good for the flare-associated CMEs, but\na different mechanism should be considered for EP-associated CMEs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet and\nbrown dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and measured\nspectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include fifteen observed by\nCoRoT, ten by Kepler and five by the Deep Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the\nobjects studied in previous papers leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems\nwith homogeneously measured properties. The Kepler data include observations\nfrom Quarter 2, and my analyses of several of the systems are the first to be\nbased on short-cadence data from this satellite. The light curves are modelled\nusing the JKTEBOP code, with attention paid to the treatment of limb darkening,\ncontaminating light, eccentricity, correlated noise, and numerical integration\nover long exposure times. The physical properties are derived using constraints\nfrom five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An alternative\napproach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star systems is explored and\nfound to give comparable numbers. My results are in good agreement with\npublished properties for most of the transiting systems, but discrepancies are\nidentified for CoRoT-5, CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the\nerrorbars quoted in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital\nephemerides are given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic\nconstraints on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the\nphotometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and\nHAT-P-11. Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system.\nWhilst most would benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156,\nHD 80606, HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterised. HAT-P-11 is\nan exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of\nsome transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be re-observed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Planetary plasma and magnetic field environments can be studied by in situ\nmeasurements or by remote sensing. While the former provide precise information\nabout plasma behaviour, instabilities and dynamics on local scales, the latter\noffers the global view necessary to understand the overall interaction of the\nmagnetospheric plasma with the solar wind. Here we propose a novel and more\nelegant approach employing remote X-ray imaging techniques, which are now\npossible thanks to the relatively recent discovery of solar wind charge\nexchange X-ray emissions in the vicinity of the Earth's magnetosphere. We\ndescribe how an appropriately designed and located X-ray telescope, supported\nby simultaneous in situ measurements of the solar wind, can be used to image\nthe dayside magnetosphere, magnetosheath and bow shock, with a temporal and\nspatial resolution sufficient to address several key outstanding questions\nconcerning how the solar wind interacts with the Earth's magnetosphere on a\nglobal level. Our studies have led us to propose 'AXIOM: Advanced X-ray Imaging\nOf the Magnetosphere', a concept mission using a Vega launcher with a LISA\nPathfinder-type Propulsion Module to place the spacecraft in a Lissajous orbit\naround the Earth - Moon L1 point. The model payload consists of an X-ray Wide\nField Imager and an in situ plasma and magnetic field measurement package. This\npackage comprises sensors designed to measure the bulk properties of the solar\nwind and to characterise its minor ion populations which cause charge exchange\nemission, and a magnetometer designed to measure the strength and direction of\nthe solar wind magnetic field.

We present a first\ngeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of A-F type stars as\nobserved in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate A-F type\nstars. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in\npulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%\nof our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as\nrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral\ntype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171\nstars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been\nobserved before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type\nstars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,\nand typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies\nwith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also\nbetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find\nindications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges\nof the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the\nentire region within the delta Sct and gamma Dor instability strips, and\nbeyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The\nlocation of gamma Dor and delta Sct classes in the (Teff,logg)-diagram has been\nextended. We investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and\n'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma Dor and delta Sct\nstars. Our results suggest a revision of the current observational instability\nstrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplement\nthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.",

Causal graphs were exploited by Williams and Nayak in order to\nanalyze plan generation for one of the controllers in NASA's Deep-Space One\nspacecraft. There, they utilized the fact that when this graph is acyclic, a\nserialization ordering over any subgoal can be obtained quickly. In this paper\nwe conduct a comprehensive study of the relationship between the structure of a\ndomain's causal graph and the complexity of planning in this domain. On the\npositive side, we show that a non-trivial polynomial time plan generation\nalgorithm exists for domains whose causal graph induces a polytree with a\nconstant bound on its node indegree. On the negative side, we show that even\nplan existence is hard when the graph is a directed-path singly connected DAG.\nMore generally, we show that the number of paths in the causal graph is closely\nrelated to the complexity of planning in the associated domain. Finally we\nrelate our results to the question of complexity of planning with serializable\nsubgoals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In recent years research in the planning community has moved increasingly\ntoward s application of planners to realistic problems involving both time and\nmany typ es of resources. For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the\nspace res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling,\nplanetary rover ex ploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and\nresource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and\nmanufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and\nreasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the\nchallenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted\nas an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in\nplanning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002) set the planning\ncommunity the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources. This\nnecessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing\ntemporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe\nthe language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax\nof the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans.\nWe observe that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power --- exceeding the\ncapabilities of current planning technology --- and presents a number of\nimportant challenges to the research community.",

However, even after nearly 7 years\nof operation of the Swift Observatory, only a handful of measurements have been\nmade soon (within a minute) after the gamma ray signal. This lack of early\nobservations fails to address burst physics at short time scales associated\nwith prompt emissions and progenitors. Because of this lack of sub-minute data,\nthe characteristics of the rise phase of optical light curve of short-hard type\nGRB and rapid-rising GRB, which may account for ~30% of all GRB, remain\npractically unknown. We have developed methods for reaching sub-minute and\nsub-second timescales in a small spacecraft observatory. Rather than slewing\nthe entire spacecraft to aim the optical instrument at the GRB position, we use\nrapidly moving mirror to redirect our optical beam. As a first step, we employ\nmotorized slewing mirror telescope (SMT), which can point to the event within\n1s, in the UFFO Pathfinder GRB Telescope onboard the Lomonosov satellite to be\nlaunched in Nov. 2011. UFFO's sub-minute measurements of the optical emission\nof dozens of GRB each year will result in a more rigorous test of current\ninternal shock models, probe the extremes of bulk Lorentz factors, provide the\nfirst early and detailed measurements of fast-rise GRB optical light curves,\nand help verify the prospect of GRB as a new standard candle. We will describe\nthe science and the mission of the current UFFO Pathfinder project, and our\nplan of a full-scale UFFO-100 as the next step.",

The Alice instrument on\nboard Rosetta, a lightweight far-ultraviolet imaging spectrograph optimized for\nin situ cometary spectroscopy in the 750-2000 A spectral band, was used to\nstudy the daytime Mars upper atmosphere including emissions from exospheric\nhydrogen and oxygen. Offset pointing, obtained five hours before closest\napproach, enabled us to detect and map the HI Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta\nemissions from exospheric hydrogen out beyond 30,000 km from the planet's\ncenter. These data are fit with a Chamberlain exospheric model from which we\nderive the hydrogen density at the 200 km exobase and the H escape flux. The\nresults are comparable to those found from the the Ultraviolet Spectrometer\nexperiment on the Mariner 6 and 7 fly-bys of Mars in 1969. Atomic oxygen\nemission at 1304 A is detected at altitudes of 400 to 1000 km above the limb\nduring limb scans shortly after closest approach. However, the derived oxygen\nscale height is not consistent with recent models of oxygen escape based on the\nproduction of suprathermal oxygen atoms by the dissociative recombination of\nO2+.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  One of the atom interferometer gravitational wave missions proposed by\nDimopoulos et al.1 in 2008 was called AGIS-Sat. 2. It had a suggested\ngravitational wave sensitivity set by the atom state detection shot noise level\nthat started at 1 mHz, was comparable to LISA sensitivity from 1 to about 20\nmHz, and had better sensitivity from 20 to 500 mHz. The separation between the\nspacecraft was 1,000 km, with atom interferometers 200 m long and shades from\nsunlight used at each end. A careful analysis of many error sources was\nincluded, but requirements on the time-stability of both the laser wavefront\naberrations and the atom temperatures in the atom clouds were not investigated.\nAfter including these considerations, the laser wavefront aberration stability\nrequirement to meet the quoted sensitivity level is about 1\\times10-8\nwavelengths, and is far tighter than for LISA. Also, the temperature\nfluctuations between atom clouds have to be less than 1 pK. An alternate atom\ninterferometer GW mission in Earth orbit called AGIS-LEO with 30 km satellite\nseparation has been suggested recently. The reduction of wavefront aberration\nnoise by sending the laser beam through a high-finesse mode-scrubbing optical\ncavity is discussed briefly, but the requirements on such a cavity are not\ngiven. Unfortunately, such an Earth-orbiting mission seems to be considerably\nmore difficult to design than a non-geocentric mission and does not appear to\nhave comparably attractive scientific goals.",

Laser phase\ntravel-time measurements would be made between the two spacecraft over a period\nof 10 or 20 days around the time when the line of sight passes through the Sun.\nThe requirements on the optical clock stability and on the drag-free systems\nwill be discussed.

This\nplanet has a mass of m_p = 10.4 +- 1.7 Earth masses and orbits a star of mass\nM_* = 0.56 +- 0.09 Solar masses at a semi-major axis of a = 3.2 (+1.9 -0.5) AU\nand an orbital period of P = 7.6 (+7.7 -1.5} yrs. The planet and host star mass\nmeasurements are enabled by the measurement of the microlensing parallax\neffect, which is seen primarily in the light curve distortion due to the\norbital motion of the Earth. But, the analysis also demonstrates the capability\nto measure microlensing parallax with the Deep Impact (or EPOXI) spacecraft in\na Heliocentric orbit. The planet mass and orbital distance are similar to\npredictions for the critical core mass needed to accrete a substantial gaseous\nenvelope, and thus may indicate that this planet is a \"failed\" gas giant.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The present OSS mission continues a long and bright tradition by associating\nthe communities of fundamental physics and planetary sciences in a single\nmission with ambitious goals in both domains. OSS is an M-class mission to\nexplore the Neptune system almost half a century after flyby of the Voyager 2\nspacecraft. Several discoveries were made by Voyager 2, including the Great\nDark Spot (which has now disappeared) and Triton's geysers. Voyager 2 revealed\nthe dynamics of Neptune's atmosphere and found four rings and evidence of ring\narcs above Neptune. Benefiting from a greatly improved instrumentation, it will\nresult in a striking advance in the study of the farthest planet of the Solar\nSystem. Furthermore, OSS will provide a unique opportunity to visit a selected\nKuiper Belt object subsequent to the passage of the Neptunian system. It will\nconsolidate the hypothesis of the origin of Triton as a KBO captured by\nNeptune, and improve our knowledge on the formation of the Solar system. The\nprobe will embark instruments allowing precise tracking of the probe during\ncruise. It allows to perform the best controlled experiment for testing, in\ndeep space, the General Relativity, on which is based all the models of Solar\nsystem formation. OSS is proposed as an international cooperation between ESA\nand NASA, giving the capability for ESA to launch an M-class mission towards\nthe farthest planet of the Solar system, and to a Kuiper Belt object. The\nproposed mission profile would allow to deliver a 500 kg class spacecraft. The\ndesign of the probe is mainly constrained by the deep space gravity test in\norder to minimise the perturbation of the accelerometer measurement.",

Nevertheless, unexpected anomalies appeared\nduring the last decades, along with the increasing precision of measurements.\nThose anomalies are present in spacecraft tracking data (Pioneer and flyby\nanomalies) as well as ephemerides. In addition, the whole theory is challenged\nat galactic and cosmic scales with the dark matter and dark energy issues.\nFinally, the unification in the framework of quantum field theories remains an\nopen question, whose solution will certainly lead to modifications of the\ntheory, even at large distances. As long as those \"dark sides\" of the universe\nhave no universally accepted interpretation nor are they observed through other\nmeans than the gravitational anomalies they have been designed to cure, these\nanomalies may as well be interpreted as deviations from GR. In this context,\nthere is a strong motivation for improved and more systematic tests of GR\ninside the solar system, with the aim to bridge the gap between gravity\nexperiments in the solar system and observations at much larger scales. We\nreview a family of metric extensions of GR which preserve the equivalence\nprinciple but modify the coupling between energy and curvature and provide a\nphenomenological framework which generalizes the PPN framework and \"fifth\nforce\" extensions of GR. We briefly discuss some possible observational\nconsequences in connection with highly accurate ephemerides.",

A second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in the\nphotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as being\ncaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. Here we apply the\nlight-curve modeling technique known as BLENDER to explore the possibility that\nthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). To aid in\nthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope at 4.5 {\\mu}m. When combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \\pm 85\nppm that is consistent with the depth in the Kepler passband (376 \\pm 9 ppm,\nignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of a\nsignificantly different color than the target. Using these observations along\nwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we are\nable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. We assess the\nlikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarm\nrate of 1.6 \\times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as a\nplanet (designated Kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. The\nradius of this object is measured to be Rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 Earth radii.\nKepler-10 c represents another example (with Kepler-9 d and Kepler-11 g) of\nstatistical \"validation\" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual\n\"confirmation\" that can take place when the Doppler signal is detected or\ntransit timing variations are measured. It is anticipated that many of Kepler's\nsmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamical\nconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of current\ninstrumentation.",

We used the polarisation ratio method of Moran and\nDavila (2004) to localise the barycentre of the CME cloud. By analysing the\ndata from both STEREO spacecraft we could resolve the plane-of-the-sky\nambiguity this method usually suffers from. Stereoscopic triangulation was used\nto independently localise the low-polarisation patch relative to the cloud. We\ndemonstrated for the first time that the bright core material is located close\nto the centre of the CME cloud. We show that the major part of the CME core\nemission, more than 85% in our case, is H$\\alpha$ radiation and only a small\nfraction is Thomson-scattered light. Recent calculations also imply that the\nplasma density in the patch is 8 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ or more compared to 2.6\n10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ for the Thomson-scattering CME environment surrounding the\ncore material.",

This Sunward acceleration appears\nto be a violation of Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation, and is\nreferred to as the Pioneer anomaly, the nature of which remains still elusive\nto unveil.\nWithin the theoretical framework of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) in what\nfollows we will address this astrodynamics puzzle, which over the last fifteen\nyears has challenged in a fundamental basis our understanding of gravitational\nphysics. To this goal we will first, and briefly, review the history of the\nPioneers 10 and 11 missions. Then a synopsis of currently available Lagrangian\nformulations of NLED is given. And finally, we present our solution of this\nenigma by invoking a special class of NLED theories featuring a proper\ndescription of electromagnetic phenomena taking place in environments where the\nstrength of the (electro)magnetic fields in the background is decidedly low.",

In\nthe mean solar wind frame, the electric field is primarily due to the\nperpendicular velocity fluctuations and has a spectral index slightly shallower\nthan -3/2, which is close to the scaling of the velocity. These results are an\nindependent confirmation of the difference in scaling between the velocity and\nmagnetic field, which is not currently well understood.

We have used 50 objects with diameters measured by radar,\noccultation or in situ imaging to characterize the systematic errors implicit\nin using the WISE data with a faceted spherical NEATM model to compute\ndiameters and albedos. By using the previously measured diameters and H\nmagnitudes with a spherical NEATM model, we compute the predicted fluxes after\napplying the color corrections given in Wright et al.

We find minimum systematic flux\nerrors of 5-10%, yielding minimum relative diameter and albedo errors of ~10%\nand ~20%, respectively. Visible albedos for the objects are computed and\ncompared to the albedos at 3.4 and 4.6 microns, which contain a mix of\nreflected sunlight and thermal emission for most asteroids. We derive a linear\nrelationship between subsolar temperature and effective temperature, which\nallows the color corrections given in Wright et al. (2010) to be used for\nasteroids by computing only subsolar temperature instead of a faceted thermal\nmodel. The thermal models derived in this paper are not intended to supplant\nprevious measurements made using radar or spacecraft imaging; rather, we have\nused them to characterize the errors that should be expected when computing\ndiameters and albedos of WISE asteroids using a spherical NEATM model.",

Here the BepiColombo rotation\nexperiment has been simulated in order to assess the ability to attain the\nmission goals and to help lay out a series of constraints on the experiment's\npossible progress. In the rotation experiment pairs of images of identical\nsurface regions taken at different epochs are used to retrieve information on\nMercury's rotation and orientation. The idea is that from observations of the\nsame patch of Mercury's surface at two different solar longitudes of Mercury\nthe orientation of Mercury can be determined, and therefore also the obliquity\nand rotation variations with respect to the uniform rotation. The estimation of\nthe libration amplitude and obliquity through pattern matching of observed\nsurface landmarks is challenging. The main problem arises from the difficulty\nto observe the same landmark on the planetary surface repeatedly over the MPO\nmission lifetime, due to the combination of Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,\nthe absence of a drift of the MPO polar orbital plane and the need to combine\ndata from different instruments with their own measurement restrictions. By\nassuming that Mercury occupies a Cassini state and that the spacecraft operates\nnominally we show that under worst case assumptions the annual libration\namplitude and obliquity can be measured with a precision of respectively 1.4\narcseconds (as) and 1.0 as over the nominal BepiColombo MPO lifetime with about\n25 landmarks for rather stringent illumination restrictions.

It aims to accurately measure some\nimportant physical properties of the Sun and to test some post-Newtonian\nfeatures of its gravitational field by continuously monitoring the Earth-probe\nrange. Preliminary sensitivity analyses show that, by assuming a cm-level\naccuracy in ranging to the spacecraft, it would be possible to detect, in\nprinciple, the Lense-Thirring effect on it at a 10^-3-10^-4 level over a\ntimescale of 2 yr, while the larger Schwarzschild component of the solar\ngravitational field may be sensed with a relative accuracy of about 10^-8-10^-9\nduring the same temporal interval. The competing range perturbation due to the\nnon-sphericity of the Sun would be a source of systematic error, but it turns\nout that all the three dynamical features of motion examined affect the\nEarth-probe range in different ways, allowing for a separation in data\nanalyses. The high eccentricity would help in reducing the impact of the\nnon-gravitational perturbations whose impact would certainly be severe when\nLETSGO would approach the Sun at just a few solar radii. Further studies should\nbe devoted to investigate both the consequences of the non-conservative forces\nand the actual measurability of the effects of interest by means of extensive\nnumerical data simulations, parameter estimations and covariance analyses.

The number of possible paths\ngrows exponentially with the number of celestial bodies. Therefore, the design\nof an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed\ncombinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve\nthe design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number\nof alternative mission options in a short time. This work proposes to formulate\nthe complete automated design of a multiple gravity assist trajectory as an\nautonomous planning and scheduling problem. The resulting scheduled plan will\nprovide the optimal planetary sequence and a good estimation of the set of\nassociated optimal trajectories. The trajectory model consists of a sequence of\ncelestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.\nFor each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the\ntime of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding\nswing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.\nFor each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers\nfrom the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents\na planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm\ninspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of\npossible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding\none node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is\nused to select a feasible direction.

The analysis outlines that thermal recoil pressure is not the cause of\nthe Rosetta flyby anomaly but likely resolves the anomalous acceleration\nobserved for Pioneer 10.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  High degree solar mode frequencies as measured by ring diagrams are known to\nchange in the presence of the strong magnetic fields found in active regions.\nWe examine these changes in frequency for a large sample of active regions\nanalyzed with data from the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard the SoHO\nspacecraft, spanning most of solar cycle 23. We confirm that the frequencies\nincrease with increasing magnetic field strength, and that this dependence is\ngenerally linear. We find that the dependence is slightly but significantly\ndifferent for active regions with different sunspot types.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We discuss the nature of rings that may exist around extrasolar planets.\nTaking the general properties of rings around the gas giants in the Solar\nSystem, we infer the likely properties of rings around exoplanets that reside\ninside the ice line. Due to their proximity to their host star, rings around\nsuch exoplanets must primarily consist of rocky materials. However, we find\nthat despite the higher densities of rock compared to ice, most of the observed\nextrasolar planets with reliable radii measurements have sufficiently large\nRoche radii to support rings. For the currently known transiting extrasolar\nplanets, Poynting-Robertson drag is not effective in significantly altering the\ndynamics of individual ring particles over a time span of $10^8$ years provided\nthat they exceed about 1 m in size. In addition, we show that significantly\nsmaller ring particles can exist in optically thick rings, for which we find\ntypical ring lifetimes ranging from a few times $10^6$ to a few times $10^9$\nyears. Most interestingly, we find that many of the rings could have nontrivial\nLaplacian planes due to the increased effects of the orbital quadrupole caused\nby the exoplanets' proximity to their host star, allowing a constraint on the\n$J_2$ of extrasolar planets from ring observations. This is particular\nexciting, since a planet's $J_2$ reveals information about its interior\nstructure. Furthermore, measurements of an exoplanet's oblateness and of its\n$J_2$, from warped rings, would together place limits on its spin period. Based\non the constraints that we have derived for extrasolar rings, we anticipate\nthat the best candidates for ring detections will come from transit\nobservations by the Kepler spacecraft of extrasolar planets with semi-major\naxes $\\sim 0.1$ AU and larger.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On the basis of gravity and radar observations with the Cassini spacecraft,\nthe moment of inertia of Titan and the orientation of Titan's rotation axis\nhave been estimated in recent studies. According to the observed orientation,\nTitan is close to the Cassini state. However, the observed obliquity is\ninconsistent with the estimate of the moment of inertia for an entirely solid\nTitan occupying the Cassini state. We propose a new Cassini state model for\nTitan in which we assume the presence of a liquid water ocean beneath an ice\nshell and consider the gravitational and pressure torques arising between the\ndifferent layers of the satellite. With the new model, we find a closer\nagreement between the moment of inertia and the rotation state than for the\nsolid case, strengthening the possibility that Titan has a subsurface ocean.",
