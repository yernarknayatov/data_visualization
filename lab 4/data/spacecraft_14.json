    "abstract": "Abstract:  We use Reinforcement Meta-Learning to optimize an adaptive integrated\nguidance, navigation, and control system suitable for exoatmospheric\ninterception of a maneuvering target. The system maps observations consisting\nof strapdown seeker angles and rate gyro measurements directly to thruster\non-off commands. Using a high fidelity six degree-of-freedom simulator, we\ndemonstrate that the optimized policy can adapt to parasitic effects including\nseeker angle measurement lag, thruster control lag, the parasitic attitude loop\nresulting from scale factor errors and Gaussian noise on angle and rotational\nvelocity measurements, and a time varying center of mass caused by fuel\nconsumption and slosh. Importantly, the optimized policy gives good performance\nover a wide range of challenging target maneuvers. Unlike previous work that\nenhances range observability by inducing line of sight oscillations, our system\nis optimized to use only measurements available from the seeker and rate gyros.\nThrough extensive Monte Carlo simulation of randomized exoatmospheric\ninterception scenarios, we demonstrate that the optimized policy gives\nperformance close to that of augmented proportional navigation with perfect\nknowledge of the full engagement state. The optimized system is computationally\nefficient and requires minimal memory, and should be compatible with today's\nflight processors.",

We analyze the short-cadence K2 light curve\nof one of those systems, Tau 4 (RX J0502.8+1624), which underwent a\nserendipitous jump from a low-accretion state into a high state during the\nfinal days of the observation. Apart from one brief flare, there was no\nevidence of accretion during the 70 d of observations of the low state. As Tau\n4 transitioned into a high state, the resumption of accretion was very gradual,\ntaking approximately six days (~90 binary orbits). We supplement Tau 4's K2\nlight curve with time-resolved spectroscopy obtained in both high and low\nstates of accretion. High-excitation lines, such as He II 468.6 nm, were\nextraordinarily weak, even when the system was actively accreting. This\nstrongly suggests the absence of an accretion shock, placing Tau 4 in the\nbombardment regime predicted for AM Herculis systems with low accretion rates.\nIn both the high-state and low-state spectra, Zeeman absorption features from\nthe white dwarf's photosphere are present and reveal a surface-averaged field\nstrength of $15\\pm2$ MG. Remarkably, the high-state spectra also show\nZeeman-split emission lines produced in a region with a field strength of\n$12\\pm1$ MG. Zeeman emission has not been previously reported in an AM Herculis\nsystem, and we propose that the phenomenon is caused by a temperature inversion\nin the WD's atmosphere near the accretion region.",

Magnetic reconnection is\none process responsible for solar wind entry into and global convection within\nthe MSP, and the MP location, orientation, and motion have an impact on the\ndynamics. Statistical studies that focus on these and other MP phenomena and\ncharacteristics inherently require MP identification in their event search\ncriteria, a task that can be automated using machine learning. We introduce a\nLong-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model to detect MP\ncrossings and assist studies of energy transfer into the MSP. As its first\napplication, the LSTM has been implemented into the operational data stream of\nthe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. MMS focuses on the electron\ndiffusion region of reconnection, where electron dynamics break magnetic field\nlines and plasma is energized. MMS employs automated burst triggers onboard the\nspacecraft and a Scientist-in-the-Loop (SITL) on the ground to select intervals\nlikely to contain diffusion regions. Only low-resolution data is available to\nthe SITL, which is insufficient to resolve electron dynamics. A strategy for\nthe SITL, then, is to select all MP crossings. Of all 219 SITL selections\nclassified as MP crossings during the first five months of model operations,\nthe model predicted 166 (76%) of them, and of all 360 model predictions, 257\n(71%) were selected by the SITL. Most predictions that were not classified as\nMP crossings by the SITL were still MP-like; the intervals contained mixed\nmagnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas. The LSTM model and its predictions\nare public to ease the burden of arduous event searches involving the MP,\nincluding those for EDRs. For MMS, this helps free up mission operation costs\nby consolidating manual classification processes into automated routines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Weakly collisional space plasmas are rarely in local thermal equilibrium and\noften exhibit non-Maxwellian electron and ion velocity distributions that lead\nto the growth of microinstabilities, that is, enhanced electric and magnetic\nfields at relatively short wavelengths. These instabilities play an active role\nin the evolution of space plasmas, as does ubiquitous broadband turbulence\ninduced by turbulent structures. This study compares certain properties of a\n2.5 dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation for the forward cascade of\nAlfvenic turbulence in a collisionless plasma against the same properties of\nturbulence observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft in the\nterrestrial magnetosheath. The PIC\nsimulation is of decaying turbulence which develops both coherent structures\nand anisotropic ion velocity distributions with the potential to drive kinetic\nscale instabilities. The uniform background magnetic field points perpendicular\nto the plane of the simulation. Growth rates are computed from linear theory\nusing the ion temperature anisotropies and ion beta values for both the\nsimulation and the observations. Both the simulation and the observations show\nthat strong anisotropies and growth rates occur highly intermittently in the\nplasma, and the simulation further shows that such anisotropies preferentially\noccur near current sheets. This suggests that, though microinstabilities may\naffect the plasma globally , they act locally and develop in response to\nextreme temperature anisotropies generated by turbulent structures. Further\nstudies will be necessary to understand why there is an apparent correlation\nbetween linear instability theory and strongly intermittent turbulence.",

Accurate location and attitude of\nspacecraft together with positions of Enceladus and Saturn at each observation\ndetermine the relationship between the three-dimensional water vapor number\ndensity in the plume and the two-dimensional profiles of water vapor abundances\nalong the line of sight recorded by UVIS.

The\nminimum velocity of water vapor in the jets is determined from the narrowest\nobserved individual jet profile: it ranges from 800 m/s to 1.8 km/s for the\nUVIS occultation observations. 41 individual jets were required to fit the\nhighest resolution UVIS dataset taken during the Solar occultation however, an\nalternative larger set of linearly-dependent jets can not be excluded without\ninvoking additional preferably unrelated data from other instruments. A smaller\nnumber of jets is required to fit the stellar occultation data because of their\nspatial resolution and geometry.

In this paper, a new\nprescribed time sliding mode control method is proposed for general systems\nwith matched disturbances, from the second-order system to the high-order\nsystem.

Here we describe\ninitial results from these encounter observations. MU69 is a bi-lobed contact\nbinary with a flattened shape, discrete geological units, and noticeable albedo\nheterogeneity. However, there is little surface color and compositional\nheterogeneity. No evidence for satellites, ring or dust structures, gas coma,\nor solar wind interactions was detected. By origin MU69 appears consistent with\npebble cloud collapse followed by a low velocity merger of its two lobes.",

Images\nfrom the flyby show that Arrokoth has no detectable rings, and no satellites\n(larger than 180 meters diameter) within a radius of 8000 km, and has a\nlightly-cratered smooth surface with complex geological features, unlike those\non previously visited Solar System bodies. The density of impact craters\nindicates the surface dates from the formation of the Solar System. The two\nlobes of the contact binary have closely aligned poles and equators,\nconstraining their accretion mechanism.",

At a geocentric distance of $10^5$ km, the plasma in the earth\nmagnetosphere will contribute as the main source of environmental noises. Here,\nwe analyze the acceleration noises that are caused by the magnetic field of\nspace plasma for the test mass of TianQin. The real solar wind data observed by\nthe Advanced Composition Explorer are taken as the input of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation. The Space Weather Modeling Framework is used to\nsimulate the global magnetosphere of the earth, from which we obtain the plasma\nand magnetic field parameters on the detector's orbits. We calculate the time\nseries of the residual accelerations and the corresponding amplitude spectral\ndensities on these orbit configurations. We find that the residual acceleration\nproduced by the interaction between the TM's magnetic moment induced by the\nspace magnetic field and the spacecraft magnetic field ($\\bm{a}_{\\rm M1}$) is\nthe dominant term, which can approach $10^{-15}$ m/s$^2$/Hz$^{1/2}$ at $f\n\\approx$ 0.2 mHz for the nominal values of the magnetic susceptibility\n($\\chi_{\\rm m} = 10^{-5}$) and the magnetic shielding factor ($\\xi_{\\rm m} =\n10$) of the test mass. The ratios between the amplitude spectral density of the\nacceleration noise caused by the space magnetic field and the preliminary goal\nof the inertial sensor are 0.38 and 0.08 at 1 mHz and 10 mHz, respectively. We\ndiscuss the further reduction of this acceleration noise by decreasing\n$\\chi_{\\rm m}$ and/or increasing $\\xi_{\\rm m}$ in the future instrumentation\ndevelopment for TianQin.",

Through formulation\nof the attitude and gyroscope bias as elements of SE(3), the corresponding\nextended Kalman filter, termed as SE(3)-EKF, has been derived. It is shown that\nthe resulting SE(3)-EKF is just the newly-derived geometric extended Kalman\nfilter (GEKF) for spacecraft attitude estimation. This provides a new\nperspective on the GEKF besides the common frame errors definition. Moreover,\nthe SE(3)-EKF with reference frame attitude error is also derived and the\nresulting algorithm bears much resemblance to the right invariant EKF.",

The current preliminary design of the Solar Ring mission is to deploy\nsix spacecraft, grouped in three pairs, on a sub-AU orbit around the Sun. The\ntwo spacecraft in each group are separated by about 30 degrees and every two\ngroups by about 120 degrees. This configuration with necessary science payloads\nwill allow us to establish three unprecedented capabilities: (1) determine the\nphotospheric vector magnetic field with unambiguity, (2) provide 360-degree\nmaps of the Sun and the inner heliosphere routinely, and (3) resolve the solar\nwind structures at multiple scales and multiple longitudes. With these\ncapabilities, the Solar Ring mission aims to address the origin of solar cycle,\nthe origin of solar eruptions, the origin of solar wind structures and the\norigin of severe space weather events. The successful accomplishment of the\nmission will advance our understanding of the star and the space environment\nthat hold our life and enhance our capability of expanding the next new\nterritory of human.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Transverse waves are sometimes observed in solar helmet streamers, typically\nafter the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CME-driven shock wave\nmoves the streamer sideways, and a decaying oscillation of the streamer is\nobserved after the CME passage. Previous works generally reported observations\nof streamer oscillations taken from a single vantage point (typically the SOHO\nspacecraft). We conduct a data survey searching for streamer wave events\nobserved by the COR2 coronagraphs onboard the STEREO spacecraft. For the first\ntime, we report observations of streamer wave events from multiple vantage\npoints, by using the COR2 instrument on both STEREO A and B, as well as the\nSOHO/LASCO C2+C3 coronagraphs. We investigate the properties of streamer waves\nby comparing the different events and performing a statistical analysis. Common\nobservational features give us additional insight on the physical nature of\nstreamer wave events. The most important conclusion is that there appears to be\nno relation between the speed of the CME and the phase speed of the resulting\nstreamer wave, indicating that the streamer wave speed is determined by the\nphysical properties of the streamer rather than the properties of the CME. This\nresult makes streamer waves events excellent candidates for coronal seismology\nstudies. From a comparison between the measured phase speeds and the phase\nspeeds calculated from the measured periods and wavelengths, we could determine\nthat the speed of the post-shock solar wind flow in our streamers is around 300\n$\\mathrm{km \\ s}^{-1}$.",

We find a compact structure with an\narea of 32.7 arcsec$^2$ within a bipolar light bridge with field strengths\nexceeding 5 kG, confirming the strong fields in this light bridge reported in\nthe literature. Two regions associated with downflows of $\\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$\nharbor field strengths larger than 6.5 kG, covering a total area of 2.97\narcsec$^2$.

Hence, combining these two techniques\nproduces an algorithm capable of handling a variety of dynamics scenarios. The\nspeed and robustness of the algorithm are highlighted in a selection of\nsimulated scenarios. First, a speed comparison is made with the\nstate-of-the-art lost-in-space star identification algorithm, Pyramid. This\ntest shows that in the best case the algorithm is on average an order of\nmagnitude faster than Pyramid. Next, the recursive algorithm is validated for a\nvariety of dynamic cases including a ground-based \"Stellar Compass\" scenario, a\nsatellite in geosynchronous orbit, a satellite during a re-orientation\nmaneuver, and a satellite undergoing non-pure-spin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  No robust detection of prompt electromagnetic counterparts to fast radio\nbursts (FRBs) has yet been obtained, in spite of several multi-wavelength\nsearches carried out so far. Specifically, X/gamma-ray counterparts are\npredicted by some models. We planned on searching for prompt gamma-ray\ncounterparts in the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT)\ndata, taking advantage of the unique combination of large effective area in the\nkeV-MeV energy range and of sub-ms time resolution. We selected 39 FRBs that\nwere promptly visible from the High-Energy (HE) instrument aboard Insight-HXMT.\nAfter calculating the expected arrival times at the location of the spacecraft,\nwe searched for a significant excess in both individual and cumulative time\nprofiles over a wide range of time resolutions, from several seconds down to\nsub-ms scales. Using the dispersion measures in excess of the Galactic terms,\nwe estimated the upper limits on the redshifts. No convincing signal was found\nand for each FRB we constrained the gamma-ray isotropic-equivalent luminosity\nand the released energy as a function of emission timescale. For the nearest\nFRB source, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, we find\n$L_{\\gamma,iso}<5.5\\times 10^{47}$ erg/s over 1 s, whereas\n$L_{\\gamma,iso}<10^{49}-10^{51}$ erg/s for the bulk of FRBs. The same values\nscale up by a factor of ~100 for a ms-long emission. Even on a timescale\ncomparable with that of the radio pulse itself no keV-MeV emission is observed.\nA systematic association with either long or short GRBs is ruled out with high\nconfidence, except for subluminous events, as is the case for core-collapse of\nmassive stars (long) or binary neutron star mergers (short) viewed off axis.\nOnly giant flares from extra-galactic magnetars at least ten times more\nenergetic than Galactic siblings are ruled out for the nearest FRB.",

Statistical analysis utilizing various in situ spacecraft\nmeasurements is the main observational approach which helps investigate the\ngeneration and evolution of these small-scale structures.

We present the SFR\nproperties including the magnetic field and plasma parameters at different\nradial distances from the sun near the ecliptic plane. It is found that the\nevent occurrence rate is still in the order of a few hundreds per month, the\nduration and scale size distributions follow power laws, and the flux rope axis\norientations are approximately centered around the local Parker spiral\ndirections. In general, most SFR properties exhibit radial decays. In addition,\nwith various databases established, we derive scaling laws for the changes of\naverage field magnitude, event counts, and SFR scale sizes, with respect to the\nradial distances, ranging from $\\sim$ 0.3 au for Helios to $\\sim$ 7 au for the\nVoyager spacecraft.

Presently, a mission to Neptune using\nelectrodynamic tethers is under consideration due to the ability of tethers to\nprovide free propulsion and power for orbital insertion as well as additional\nexploratory maneuvering --- providing more mission capability than a standard\norbiter mission. Tether operation depends on plasma density and magnetic field\n$\\mathbf{B}$, though tethers can deal with ill-defined density profiles, with\nthe anodic segment self-adjusting to accommodate densities. Planetary magnetic\nfields are due to currents in some small volume inside the planet,\nmagnetic-moment vector, and typically a dipole law approximation --- which\ndescribes the field outside. When compared with Saturn and Jupiter, the\nNeptunian magnetic structure is significantly more complex: the dipole is\nlocated below the equatorial plane, is highly offset from the planet center,\nand at large tilt with its rotation axis. Lorentz-drag work decreases quickly\nwith distance, thus requiring spacecraft periapsis at capture close to the\nplanet and allowing the large offset to make capture efficiency\n(spacecraft-to-tether mass ratio) well above a no-offset case. The S/C might\noptimally reach periapsis when crossing the meridian plane of the dipole, with\nthe S/C facing it; this convenient synchronism is eased by Neptune rotating\nlittle during capture. Calculations yield maximum efficiency of approximately\n12, whereas a $10^{\\circ}$ meridian error would reduce efficiency by about 6%.\nEfficiency results suggest new calculations should be made to fully include\nNeptunian rotation and consider detailed dipole and quadrupole corrections.",

To prevent uncertainties due to the in-flight calibration of EIS,\nwe selected spectral atlases observed shortly after the launch of the mission.\nOne spectral atlas contains an observation of an active region, while the other\nis an off-limb quiet Sun region. To minimize the uncertainties of the\ndiagnostics, we rely only on strong lines and we average the signal over a\nspatial area within selected structures.

To do that, we use a simple, well-converging\niterative scheme based on refining the initial density estimates via the DEM\nand $\\kappa$. We find that while the quiet Sun spectra are consistent with a\nMaxwellian distribution, the coronal loops and moss observed within active\nregion are strongly non-Maxwellian with $\\kappa$ $\\lessapprox$ 3. These results\nwere checked by calculating synthetic ratios using DEMs obtained as a function\nof $\\kappa$.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The farside of the Moon is a pristine, quiet platform to conduct low radio\nfrequency observations of the early Universe's Dark Ages, as well as space\nweather and magnetospheres associated with habitable exoplanets. In this paper,\nthe astrophysics associated with NASA-funded concept studies will be described\nincluding a lunar-orbiting spacecraft, DAPPER, that will measure the 21 cm\nglobal spectrum at redshifts 40-80, and an array of low frequency dipoles on\nthe lunar farside surface, FARSIDE, that would detect exoplanet magnetic\nfields. DAPPER observations (17-38 MHz), using a single cross-dipole antenna,\nwill measure the amplitude of the 21 cm spectrum to the level required to\ndistinguish the standard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmological model from those of\nadditional cooling models possibly produced by exotic physics such as dark\nmatter interactions. FARSIDE has a notional architecture consisting of 128\ndipole antennas deployed across a 10 km area by a rover. FARSIDE would image\nthe entire sky each minute in 1400 channels over 0.1-40 MHz. This would enable\nmonitoring of the nearest stellar systems for the radio signatures of coronal\nmass ejections and energetic particle events, and would also detect the\nmagnetospheres of the nearest candidate habitable exoplanets. In addition,\nFARSIDE would determine the Dark Ages global 21 cm signal at yet lower\nfrequencies and provide a pathfinder for power spectrum measurements.",

In contrast to charged particles, neutral\nparticles (neutrons and gamma-rays) are measured indirectly: the energy\ndeposition spectra produced by neutral particles are complex convolutions of\nthe incident particle spectra with the detector response functions. An\ninversion technique has been developed and applied to jointly unfold the\ndeposited energy spectra measured in two scintillators of different types (CsI\nfor high gamma detection efficiency, and plastic for neutrons) to obtain the\nneutron and gamma-ray spectra. This result is important for determining the\nbiological impact of the Martian surface radiation contributed by neutrons,\nwhich interact with materials differently from the charged particles. These\nfirst in-situ measurements on Mars provide (1) an important reference for\nassessing the radiation-associated health risks for future manned missions to\nthe red planet and (2) an experimental input for validating the particle\ntransport codes used to model the radiation environments within spacecraft or\non the surface of planets.

These objects can hit and damage a spacecraft or\nits components. It is thus necessary to assess the risk level for a satellite\nduring its mission lifetime. Few software packages perform this analysis, and\nmost of them employ time-consuming ray-tracing methodology, where particles are\nrandomly sampled from relevant distributions.

The paper\npresents the development of a vulnerability assessment model, which relies on a\nfully statistical procedure: the debris fluxes are directly used combining them\nwith the concept of the vulnerable zone, avoiding the random sampling the\ndebris fluxes. A novel methodology is presented to predict damage to internal\ncomponents. It models the interaction between the components and the secondary\ndebris cloud through basic geometric operations, considering mutual shielding\nand shadowing between internal components. The methodologies are tested against\nstate-of-the-art software for relevant test cases, comparing results on\nexternal structures and internal components.",

Classical signatures of the ion diffusion\nregion (IDR), including a sub-ion-Alfv\u00e9nic de-magnetized ion exhaust, a\nsuper-ion-Alfv\u00e9nic magnetized electron exhaust, and Hall electromagnetic\nfields, are identified. The opening angle between the magnetopause and\nmagnetospheric separatrix is $30^\\circ\\pm5^\\circ$. The exhaust preferentially\nexpands sunward, displacing the magnetosheath. Intense pileup of reconnected\nmagnetic flux occurs between the magnetosheath separatrix and the magnetopause\nin a narrow channel intermediate between the ion and electron scales. The\nstrength of the pileup (normalized values of 0.3-0.5) is consistent with the\nlarge angle at which the magnetopause is inclined relative to the overall\nreconnection coordinates. MMS-4, which was two ion inertial lengths closer to\nthe X-line than the other three spacecraft, observed intense electron-dominated\ncurrents and kinetic-to-electromagnetic-field energy conversion within the\npileup. MMS-1, 2, and 3 did not observe the intense currents nor the\nparticle-to-field energy conversion but did observe the pileup, indicating that\nthe edge of the generation region was contained within the tetrahedron.\nComparisons with particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the electron currents\nand large inclination angle of the magnetopause are interconnected features of\nthe asymmetric Hall effect. Between the separatrix and the magnetopause,\nhigh-density inflowing magnetosheath electrons brake and turn into the outflow\ndirection, imparting energy to the normal magnetic field and generating the\npileup. The findings indicate that electron dynamics are likely an important\ninfluence on the magnetic field structure within the ion diffusion region.",

Imaging showed MU69 to be a contact-binary, made of two individual\nlobes connected by a narrow neck, rotating at low spin period (15.92 h), and\nhaving high obliquity (~98 deg), similar to other KBO contact-binaries inferred\nthrough photometric observations. The origin of such peculiar configurations is\npuzzling, and all scenarios suggested for the origins of contact-binaries fail\nto reproduce such properties and their likely high frequency. Here we show that\nsemi-secular perturbations operating only on ultra-wide (~0.1-0.4 Hill-radius)\nKBO-binaries can robustly lead to gentle, slow-speed binary mergers at\narbitrarily high obliquities, but low rotational velocities, that can reproduce\nMU69's (and similar oblique contact binaries) characteristics. Using N-body\nsimulations, we find that ~15% of all ultra-wide binaries with cosine-uniform\ninclination distribution are likely to merge through this process. Moreover, we\nfind that such mergers are sufficiently gentle as to only slightly deform the\nKBO shape, and can produce the measured rotation speed of MU69. The\nsemi-secular contact-binary formation channel not only explains the observed\nproperties of MU69, but could also apply for other Kuiper/asteroid belt\nbinaries, and for Solar/extra-solar moon systems.",

In contrast to ion\nthrusters, which utilize the Coulomb force to accelerate positively charged\nspecies, electromagnetic propulsion systems utilize the Lorentz force to\naccelerate all species in a quasi-neutral state, providing significant\ntechnological benefits over ion thrusters. Several forms of electromagnetic\npropulsion have been researched and developed, such as the Variable Specific\nImpulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, pulsed inductive thrusters, and the electrodeless\nplasma thruster. One of the most promising forms of electromagnetic propulsion,\nhowever, has been the magnetoplasmadynamic thruster. Whereas other\nelectromagnetic propulsion systems provide high specific impulse values but low\nthrust capabilities, magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters have demonstrated the\npotential for both high specific impulse values and high thrust densities.\nHowever, these thrusters are not without drawbacks and suffer from issues such\nas electrode erosion. A proposed subtype of these thrusters, known as the\nLithium Lorentz Force Accelerator, has been shown to address some of these\nissues. As is demonstrated in this paper, mission duration is not notably\nimproved by the use of Lithium Lorentz Force Accelerators except for mission\ndistances beyond the capabilities of current propulsion technology. It is also\nshown that increasing the amount of batteries onboard a spacecraft does not\nnecessarily decrease mission duration due to the specific power of current\nbattery technology, which is on the order of 10^3 W/kg, but that new\ndevelopments in nuclear energy technology may allow these thrusters to become\nefficacious for missions for which current propulsion technology is\ninsufficient.",

The Context Camera (CTX) on MRO has returned over\n100,000 images of the planet at approximately 5-6 meters per pixel, providing\nnearly global coverage. During that time, Mars has gone through nearly 7 of its\nown years, changing solar distance from 1.38 to 1.67 AU and the corresponding\nsolar flux by 45% due to its orbital eccentricity. Seasonal effects and\ntransient phenomena affect atmospheric transparency. Combined with an aging\ndetector, CTX images are difficult to mosaic seamlessly, for all of these\nchanges prevent equalizing images to create a visually smoothly illuminated\nproduct.

We describe how the process works, which uses a\nreference source to tie brightness values, and demonstrate its effects across\nMars' surface. While the workflow developed for this product is applicable to\nother planetary bodies, it requires a reference source, which may not yet\nexist.",

The gradients are intrinsically related to agyrotropic features of the\ndistribution function. This method predicts the gradients in the magnetized\ndistribution function, and can predict gradients of arbitrary moments of the\ngyrotropic background distribution function. The method allows for estimates on\ndensity and pressure gradients on the scale of a Larmor radius, proving to\nresolve smaller scales than any method currently available to spacecraft. The\nmodel is verified with a set of fully-kinetic VPIC particle-in-cell\nsimulations.",

The low amplitude light curves of (471931) 2013\nPH44 and (250112) 2002 KY14 can be explained either by albedo variegations,\nbinarity or elongated shape. (353222) 2009 YD7 and (514312) 2016 AE193 could be\nrotating elongated objects, while 2017 CX33 and 2012 VU85 are the most\npromising binary candidates due to their slow rotations and higher light curve\namplitudes. (463368) 2012 VU85 has the longest rotation period, P=56.2h\nobserved among Centaurs. The P>20h rotation periods obtained for the two\npotential binaries underlines the importance of long, uninterrupted time series\nphotometry of solar system targets that can suitably be performed only from\nspacecraft, like the Kepler in the K2 mission, and the currently running TESS\nmission.",

However, an object which\ncan control its shape can also control its motion: Except where forbidden by\nsymmetries and their associated conservation laws, a shape-changing (but\nrocket-free) spacecraft can have complete control over its trajectory. We\ndiscuss a general formalism which allows rocket-free maneuvers to be understood\nwithout constructing detailed interior models. A spacecraft's interior is\nabstracted to the specification of a quadrupole moment, and in some cases, it\nis only a single eigenvalue of that moment which is relevant. For orbits around\na spherically-symmetric mass, we show that appropriately varying the relevant\neigenvalue allows the energy and eccentricity of an orbit to be increased or\ndecreased and its apsides to be rotated arbitrarily. Strategies are identified\nwhich optimize these maneuvers. In other contexts, we show that extended-body\neffects can be used to stabilize orbits which would otherwise be unstable.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large-scale interplanetary transient structures in\nthe heliosphere that travel from the Sun into the interplanetary medium. The\ninternal magnetic field lines inside the MCs are twisted, forming a flux rope\n(FR). This magnetic field structuring is determined by its initial solar\nconfiguration, by the processes involved during its eruption from the Sun, and\nby the dynamical evolution during its interaction with the ambient solar wind.\nOne of the most important properties of the magnetic structure inside MCs is\nthe twist of the field lines forming the FR (the number of turns per unit\nlength). The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly\nbecause the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft\ntrajectory, and thus it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical\nassumptions. Estimating the twist from the study of a single event is difficult\nbecause the field fluctuations significantly increase the noise of the observed\nB time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist. The superposed epoch\napplied to MCs has proven to be a powerful technique, permitting the extraction\nof their common features, and removing the peculiarity of individual cases. We\napply a superposed epoch technique to analyse the magnetic components in the\nlocal FR frame of a significant sample of moderately asymmetric MCs observed at\n1 au. From the superposed profile of B components in the FR frame, we determine\nthe typical twist distribution in MCs. The twist is nearly uniform in the FR\ncore (central half part), and it increases moderately, up to a factor two,\ntowards the MC boundaries. This profile is close to the Lundquist field model\nlimited to the FR core where the axial field component is above about one-third\nof its central value.",

It will cover a broad range of\nobserving bands including those used for tracking of and communications to deep\nspace missions. While spacecraft tracking is not a main application defining\nthe technical specifications of the SKA, this facility might play a role in\ntracking deep space probes as a backup to the ``dedicated'' deep space tracking\nnetworks. This paper presents possible applications of the SKA as a deep space\ntracking facility and major related technical specifications of various\nconcepts of the SKA. It was presented at the 3rd International Workshop on\nTracking, Telemetry and Command Systems for Space Applications, ESA-ESOC,\nDarmstadt, Germany, 7-9 September 2004. Over the past years, the SKA concept\nhas developed to a much higher level of detalisation and is currently at the\nimplementation phase. A number of specific considerations in this presentation\nno longer correspond to the actual status of the SKA project. However, the\noverall concept of the SKA applications for communication and tracking of\ninterplanetary spacecraft remain topical, and some approaches presented here\nremain of interest for prospective deep space missions.",

These waves often coincide\nwith local minima of the magnetic field magnitude or with sudden deflections of\nthe magnetic field that are called switchbacks. Their sunward propagation leads\nto a significant Doppler frequency downshift from 200-300 Hz to 20-80 Hz (from\n0.2 f/fce to 0.5 f/fce). The polarization of these waves varies from\nquasi-parallel to significantly oblique with wave normal angles that are close\nto the resonance cone. Their peak amplitude can be as large as 2 to 4 nT. Such\nvalues represent approximately 10% of the background magnetic field, which is\nconsiderably more than what is observed at 1 a.u. Recent numerical studies show\nthat such waves may potentially play a key role in breaking the heat flux and\nscattering the Strahl population of suprathermal electrons into a halo\npopulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs), showing up to a 10,000-fold\nabundance enhancement of rare elements like 3He or ultra-heavy nuclei, have\nbeen a puzzle for more than 50 years. One reason for the current lack of\nunderstanding of 3He-rich SEPs is the difficulty resolving the source regions\nof these commonly occurring events. Since their discovery, there has been\nstrong evidence that 3He-rich SEP production is associated with flares on the\nSun. Anomalous abundances of 3He-rich SEPs have been attributed to a unique\nacceleration mechanism that must routinely operate at flare sites. Flares\nassociated with 3He-rich SEPs have been often observed in jet-like forms\nindicating an acceleration in magnetic reconnection involving field lines open\nto interplanetary space. Owing to a fleet of spacecraft around the Sun,\nproviding a greatly improved resolution of solar imaging observations, 3He-rich\nSEP sources are now explored in unprecedented detail. This paper outlines the\ncurrent understanding of 3He-rich SEPs, mainly focusing on their solar sources.",

Imitation (supervised) learning of optimal examples is used as a\nnetwork training paradigm. The resulting models are suitable for an on-board,\nreal-time, implementation of the optimal guidance and control system of the\nspacecraft and are called G&CNETs. A new general methodology called Backward\nGeneration of Optimal Examples is introduced and shown to be able to\nefficiently create all the optimal state action pairs necessary to train\nG&CNETs without solving optimal control problems. With respect to previous\nworks, we are able to produce datasets containing a few orders of magnitude\nmore optimal trajectories and obtain network performances compatible with real\nmissions requirements. Several schemes able to train representations of either\nthe optimal policy (thrust profile) or the value function (optimal mass) are\nproposed and tested. We find that both policy learning and value function\nlearning successfully and accurately learn the optimal thrust and that a\nspacecraft employing the learned thrust is able to reach the target conditions\norbit spending only 2 permil more propellant than in the corresponding\nmathematically optimal transfer. Moreover, the optimal propellant mass can be\npredicted (in case of value function learning) within an error well within 1%.\nAll G&CNETs produced are tested during simulations of interplanetary transfers\nwith respect to their ability to reach the target conditions optimally starting\nfrom nominal and off-nominal conditions.",
