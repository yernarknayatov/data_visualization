    "abstract": "Abstract:  The flyby anomalies are unexplained velocity jumps of 3.9, -4.6, 13.5, -2,\n1.8 and 0.02 mm/s observed near closest approach during the Earth flybys of six\nspacecraft. These flybys are modelled here using a theory that assumes that\ninertia is due to a form of Unruh radiation, and varies with acceleration due\nto a Hubble-scale Casimir effect. Considering the acceleration of the craft\nrelative to every particle of the rotating Earth, the theory predicts that\nthere is a slight reduction in inertial mass with increasing latitude for an\nunbound craft, since near the pole it sees a lower average relative\nacceleration. Applying this theory to the in- and out-bound flyby paths, with\nconservation of momentum, the predicted anomalies were 2.9, -0.9, 20.1, 0.9,\n3.2 and -1.3 mm/s. Three of the flyby anomalies were reproduced within error\nbars, and the theory explains their recently-observed dependence on the\nlatitude difference between their incident and exit trajectories. The errors\nfor the other three flybys were between 1 and 3 mm/s.",

Here\nwe report on the spectroscopic detection of such a subdwarf in the Be binary\nsystem FY Canis Majoris from the analysis of data acquired by the IUE\nspacecraft and KPNO Coude Feed Telescope over the course of 16 and 21 years,\nrespectively. We present a double-lined spectroscopic orbit for the binary\nbased upon radial velocities from the IUE spectra and use the orbital solutions\nwith a Doppler tomography algorithm to reconstruct the components' UV spectra.\nThe subdwarf is hot (T_eff = 45+/-5 kK) and has a mass of about 1.3 M_sun and a\nradius of about 0.6 R_sun. It contributes about 4% as much flux as the Be star\ndoes in the FUV. We also present observations of the H-alpha and He I 6678\nemission features that are formed in the circumstellar disk of the Be star.\nOrbital flux and velocity variations in the He I 6678 profile indicate that\nmuch of the emission forms along the disk rim facing the hot subdwarf where the\ndisk is probably heated by the incident radiation from the subdwarf. A study of\nthe FUV infall shell lines discovered in the 1980s confirms their episodic\npresence but reveals that they tend to be found around both quadrature phases,\nunlike the pattern in Algol binaries. Phase-dependent variations in the UV N V\ndoublet suggest the presence of a N-enhanced wind from the subdwarf and a\npossible shock-interaction region between the stars where the subdwarf's wind\ncollides with the disk of the Be star.",

Systematic comparisons\nof spectral characteristics, including variance anisotropy and scale-dependent\nspectral anisotropy features in wave vector space were possible due to the\nwell-documented reconnection events, occurring between the positions of Cluster\n(X = -14--16 $R_e$) and TC-2 (X = -6.6 $R_e$). Another factor of key importance\nis that the magnetometers on the spacecraft are similar. The comparisons\nprovide further evidence for asymmetry of physical processes in\nEarthward/tailward reconnection outflow regions. Variance anisotropy and\nspectral anisotropy angles estimated from the multi-scale magnetic fluctuations\nin the tailward outflow region show features which are characteristic for\nmagnetohydrodynamic cascading turbulence in the presence of a local mean\nmagnetic field. The multi-scale magnetic fluctuations in the Earthward outflow\nregion are exhibiting more power, lack of variance and scale dependent\nanisotropies, but also having larger anisotropy angles. In this region the\nmagnetic field is more dipolar, the main processes driving turbulence are flow\nbreaking/mixing, perhaps combined with turbulence ageing and non-cascade\nrelated multi-scale energy sources.",

In order to attain\nthe requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be\nsuppressed below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise,\nacceleration noise etc. This is achieved by combining time-delayed data for\nwhich precise knowledge of time-delays is required. The gravitational field,\nmainly that of the Sun and the motion of LISA affect the time-delays and the\noptical links. Further, the effect of the gravitational field of the Earth on\nthe orbits of spacecraft is included. This leads to additional flexing over and\nabove that of the Sun. We have written a numerical code which computes the\noptical links, that is, the time-delays with great accuracy $\\sim 10^{-2}$\nmetres - more than what is required for time delay interferometry (TDI) - for\nmost of the orbit and with sufficient accuracy within $\\sim 10$ metres for an\nintegrated time window of about six days, when one of the arms tends to be\ntangent to the orbit. Our analysis of the optical links is fully general\nrelativistic and the numerical code takes into account effects such as the\nSagnac, Shapiro delay, etc.. We show that with the deemed parameters in the\ndesign of LISA, there are symmetries inherent in the configuration of LISA and\nin the physics, which may be used effectively to suppress the residual laser\nnoise in the modified first generation TDI. We demonstrate our results for some\nimportant TDI variables.",

We initiate two CMEs from the same active\nregion, one approximately a day earlier that preconditions the solar wind for\nthe much faster CME on the 28th. This second CME travels through the corona at\na rate of over 2500 km s$^{-1}$ driving a strong forward shock. We clearly\nidentify this shock in an image produced by the Large Angle Spectrometric\nCoronagraph (LASCO) C3, and reproduce the shock and its appearance in synthetic\nwhite light images from the simulation. We find excellent agreement with both\nthe general morphology and the quantitative brightness of the model CME with\nLASCO observations. These results demonstrate that the CME shape is largely\ndetermined by its interaction with the ambient solar wind and may not be\nsensitive to the initiation process. We then show how the CME would appear as\nobserved by wide-angle coronagraphs onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory (STEREO) spacecraft.

A density inhomogeneity will cause an offset between the\ncenter of figure and the center of mass and a re-orientation of the principal\naxes away from those associated with the shape alone. Both of these effects can\nalter the predicted YORP rate of change in angular velocity and obliquity. We\napply these corrections to the Itokawa shape model and find that its YORP\nangular velocity rate is sensitive to offsets between its center of mass and\ncenter of figure, with a shift on the order of 10 meters being able to change\nthe sign of the YORP effect for that asteroid. Given the non-detection of YORP\nfor Itokawa as of 2008, this can shed light on the density distribution within\nthat body. The theory supports a shift of the asteroid center of mass towards\nItokawa's neck region, where there is an accumulation of finer gravels.\nDetection of the YORP effect for Itokawa should provide some strong constraints\non its density distribution. This theory could also be applied to asteroids\nvisited by future spacecraft to constrain density inhomogeneities.",

This provides conclusive evidence that the observed\nhelical structure is real and is not resulting from possible projection effects\nof single viewpoint observations.

Observations of the Mercury transit from November 2006 and the\nsolar eclipse(s) from 2007 are used to determine the PSFs of SOT for the blue,\ngreen, and red continuum channels of the BFI. For each channel large grids of\ntheoretical point spread functions are calculated by convolution of the ideal\ndiffraction-limited PSF and Voigt profiles. These PSFs are applied to\nartificial images of an eclipse and a Mercury transit. The comparison of the\nresulting artificial intensity profiles across the terminator and the\ncorresponding observed profiles yields a quality measure for each case. The\noptimum PSF for each observed image is indicated by the best fit. The observed\nimages of the Mercury transit and the eclipses exhibit a clear proportional\nrelation between the residual intensity and the overall light level in the\ntelescope. In addition there is a anisotropic stray-light contribution. ...\nBFI/SOT operate close to the diffraction limit and have only a rather small\nstray-light contribution. The FWHM of the PSF is broadened by only ~1% with\nrespect to the diffraction-limited case, while the overall Strehl ratio is ~\n0.8. In view of the large variations -- best seen in the residual intensities\nof eclipse images -- and the dependence on the overall light level and position\nin the FOV, a range of PSFs should be considered instead of a single PSF per\nwavelength. The individual PSFs of that range allow then the determination of\nerror margins for the quantity under investigation.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Alfven waves and ion-cyclotron absorption of high-frequency waves are\nfrequently brought into models devoted to coronal heating and fast solar-wind\nacceleration. Signatures of ion-cyclotron resonance have already been observed\nin situ in the solar wind (HELIOS spacecrafts) and, recently, in the upper\ncorona (UVCS/SOHO remote-sensing results). We propose a method to constrain\nboth the Alfven wave amplitude and the preferential heating induced by\nion-cyclotron resonance, above a partially developed polar coronal hole\nobserved with the SUMER/SOHO spectrometer. The instrumental stray light\ncontribution is first substracted from the spectra. By supposing that the\nnon-thermal velocity is related to the Alfven wave amplitude, it is constrained\nthrough a density diagnostic and the gradient of the width of the Mg X 625 A\nline. The temperatures of several coronal ions, as functions of the distance\nabove the limb, are then determined by substracting the non-thermal component\nto the observed line widths. The effect of stray light explains the apparent\ndecrease with height in the width of several spectral lines, this decrease\nusually starting about 0.1-0.2 Rs above the limb. This result rules out any\ndirect evidence of damping of the Alfven waves, often suggested by other\nauthors. We also find that the ions with the smallest charge-to-mass ratios are\nthe hottest ones at a fixed altitude and that they are subject to a stronger\nheating, as compared to the others, between 57\" and 102\" above the limb. This\nconstitutes a serious clue to ion-cyclotron preferential heating.",

The complexity of the charge exchange interactions has\nlimited our analytic understanding so far. In this work we develop a\nsemi-analytic one-dimensional model based upon a double expansion technique to\ninvestigate the self-consistent interaction of shock with neutrals. The\nunderlying method uses the Boltzmann transport equation that describes neutral\ntransport, and is coupled to plasma protons predominantly through charge\nexchange processes. The gyrotropic distribution function of the neutrals is\nfirst expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials followed by associated Laguerre\nharmonics. The resulting set of equations can be cast into a square matrix\nwhose eigenvalues depend upon sources and the plasma distribution. The\ninterstellar protons, in a high $\\beta$ limit, are described by a hydrodynamic\nfluid with source terms that couple neutrals and plasma and further modify both\ndistributions in a self-consistent manner.",

The Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) is the cloud observed on\nmost lines of sight and may be the cloud that immediately surrounds our Solar\nSystem, the properties of which set the outer boundary conditions of the\nheliosphere. Using absorption line data toward nearby stars, in situ\nobservations of inflowing interstellar gas from spacecraft in the Solar System,\nand theoretical modeling of the interstellar radiation field and radiative\ntransfer, we can deduce many characteristics of the LIC. We find that the LIC\nis partially ionized with modest electron density, n(e) ~ 0.07 cm^-3. The\ncombination of its temperature and ionization favor photoionization/thermal\nequilibrium over a non-equilibrium cooling cloud picture. The abundances in the\nLIC suggest moderate dust destruction for silicate dust but complete\ndestruction of carbonaceous grains. An origin for the LIC as a density\nenhancement in the ambient medium that has been overrun by a shock seems\nlikely, while its velocity away from the Sco-Cen association points to a\npossible connection to that region and the Loop I bubble.",

In all, a few thousand dust impacts were counted with the instrument\naccumulators during both ring passages, but only a total of 110 complete data\nsets of dust impacts were transmitted to Earth. Detected particle sizes range\nfrom about 0.2 to 5 micron, extending the known size distribution by an order\nof magnitude towards smaller particles than previously derived from optical\nimaging (Showalter et al. 2008).

The size distribution for the\nAmalthea ring derived from our in-situ measurements for the small grains agrees\nvery well with the one obtained from images for large grains. Our analysis\nshows that particles contributing most to the optical cross-section are about 5\nmicron in radius, in agreement with imaging results.

Moreover, a decentralized\ntranslational tracking control law based on phase synchronization is presented,\nthus enabling coupled translational and rotational maneuvers.

By comparing the spacecraft locations and AKR\nburst locations, the angular beaming pattern was found to be narrowly confined\nto a plane containing the magnetic field vector at the source and tangent to a\ncircle of constant latitude. Most rays paths are confined within 15 deg of this\ntangent plane, consistent with numerical simulations of AKR k-vector\norientation at maximum growth rate. The emission is also strongly directed\nupward in the tangent plane, which we interpret as refraction of the rays as\nthey leave the auroral cavity. The narrow beaming pattern implies that an\nobserver located above the polar cap can detect AKR emission only from a small\nfraction of the auroral oval at a given location. This has important\nconsequences for interpreting AKR visibility at a given location. It also helps\nre-interpret previously published Cluster VLBI studies of AKR source locations,\nwhich are now seen to be only a subset of all possible source locations. These\nobservations are inconsistent with either filled or hollow cone beaming models.",

In the years prior to the\nexploration of Titan's surface by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, the\nproduction and condensation of ethane was expected to have formed a\nsatellite-wide ocean one kilometer in depth, assuming that it was generated\nover the Solar system's lifetime. However, Cassini-Huygens observations failed\nto find any evidence of such an ocean. Here we describe the main cause of the\nethane deficiency on Titan: cryovolcanic lavas regularly cover its surface,\nleading to the percolation of the liquid hydrocarbons through this porous\nmaterial and its accumulation in subsurface layers built up during successive\nmethane outgassing events. The liquid stored in the pores may, combined with\nthe ice layers, form a stable ethane-rich clathrate reservoir, potentially\nisolated from the surface. Even with a low open porosity of 10% for the\nsubsurface layers, a cryovolcanic icy crust less than 2300 m thick is required\nto bury all the liquid hydrocarbons generated over the Solar system's lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a detailed analysis of oxygen ion velocity distributions in the\nextended solar corona, based on observations made with the Ultraviolet\nCoronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on the SOHO spacecraft. Polar coronal holes at\nsolar minimum are known to exhibit broad line widths and unusual intensity\nratios of the O VI 1032, 1037 emission line doublet. The traditional\ninterpretation of these features has been that oxygen ions have a strong\ntemperature anisotropy, with the temperature perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield being much larger than the temperature parallel to the field. However,\nrecent work by Raouafi and Solanki suggested that it may be possible to model\nthe observations using an isotropic velocity distribution. In this paper we\nanalyze an expanded data set to show that the original interpretation of an\nanisotropic distribution is the only one that is fully consistent with the\nobservations. It is necessary to search the full range of ion plasma parameters\nto determine the values with the highest probability of agreement with the UVCS\ndata. The derived ion outflow speeds and perpendicular kinetic temperatures are\nconsistent with earlier results, and there continues to be strong evidence for\npreferential ion heating and acceleration with respect to hydrogen. At\nheliocentric heights above 2.1 solar radii, every UVCS data point is more\nconsistent with an anisotropic distribution than with an isotropic\ndistribution. At heights above 3 solar radii, the exact probability of isotropy\ndepends on the electron density chosen to simulate the line-of-sight\ndistribution of O VI emissivity. (abridged abstract)",

A new field of interest based on\nsparsity has recently emerged: compressed sensing. This theory is a new\nsampling framework that provides an alternative to the well-known Shannon\nsampling theory. In this paper we investigate how compressed sensing (CS) can\nprovide new insights into astronomical data compression and more generally how\nit paves the way for new conceptions in astronomical remote sensing. We first\ngive a brief overview of the compressed sensing theory which provides very\nsimple coding process with low computational cost, thus favoring its use for\nreal-time applications often found on board space mission. We introduce a\npractical and effective recovery algorithm for decoding compressed data. In\nastronomy, physical prior information is often crucial for devising effective\nsignal processing methods. We particularly point out that a CS-based\ncompression scheme is flexible enough to account for such information. In this\ncontext, compressed sensing is a new framework in which data acquisition and\ndata processing are merged. We show also that CS provides a new fantastic way\nto handle multiple observations of the same field view, allowing us to recover\ninformation at very low signal-to-noise ratio, which is impossible with\nstandard compression methods. This CS data fusion concept could lead to an\nelegant and effective way to solve the problem ESA is faced with, for the\ntransmission to the earth of the data collected by PACS, one of the instruments\non board the Herschel spacecraft which will be launched in 2008.",

In terms of image intensities, these features are elongated ridge-like\nintensity maxima. To discriminate the maxima, we need information about the\nspatial derivatives of the image intensity. Commonly, the derivative estimates\nare strongly affected by image noise. We therefore use a regularized estimation\nof the derivative which is then used to interpolate a discrete vector field of\nridge points ``ridgels'' which are positioned on the ridge center and have the\nintrinsic orientation of the local ridge direction. A scheme is proposed to\nconnect ridgels to smooth, spline-represented curves which fit the observed\nloops. Finally, a half-automated user interface allows one to merge or split,\neliminate or select loop fits obtained form the above procedure. In this paper\nwe apply our tool to one of the first EUV images observed by the SECCHI\ninstrument onboard the recently launched STEREO spacecraft. We compare the\nextracted loops with projected field lines computed from\nalmost-simultaneously-taken magnetograms measured by the SOHO/MDI Doppler\nimager. The field lines were calculated using a linear force-free field model.\nThis comparison allows one to verify faint and spurious loop connections\nproduced by our segmentation tool and it also helps to prove the quality of the\nmagnetic-field model where well-identified loop structures comply with\nfield-line projections.

As a first step we recently presented an analytical method to\ncalculate simple two-dimensional stationary models of triple helmet streamer\nconfigurations.

Our results\nindicate that small eruptions at the helmet streamer cusp may incessantly\naccelerate small amounts of plasma without significant changes of the\nequilibrium configuration and might thus contribute to the non-stationary slow\nsolar wind. On larger time and length scales, large coronal eruptions can occur\nas a consequence of large scale magnetic reconnection events inside the\nstreamer configuration.

While accretion disk models driven by a generic turbulent viscosity\nhave been invoked as a means to explain such large-scale transport, the\ndetailed physics behind such an ``alpha'' viscosity remains unclear. We present\nhere an alternative physical mechanism for large-scale transport in the solar\nnebula: gravitational torques associated with the transient spiral arms in a\nmarginally gravitationally unstable disk, of the type that appears to be\nnecessary to form gas giant planets. Three dimensional models are presented of\nthe time evolution of self-gravitating disks, including radiative transfer and\ndetailed equations of state, showing that small dust grains will be transported\nupstream and downstream (with respect to the mean inward flow of gas and dust\nbeing accreted by the central protostar) inside the disk on time scales of less\nthan 1000 yr inside 10 AU. These models furthermore show that any initial\nspatial heterogeneities present (e.g., in short-lived isotopes such as 26Al)\nwill be homogenized by disk mixing down to a level of ~10%, preserving the use\nof short-lived isotopes as accurate nebular chronometers, while simultaneously\nallowing for the spread of stable oxygen isotope ratios. This finite level of\nnebular spatial heterogeneity appears to be related to the coarse mixing\nachieved by spiral arms, with radial widths of order 1 AU, over time scales of\n~1000 yrs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Using full-disk observations obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)\non board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft, we present\nvariations of the solar acoustic mode frequencies caused by the solar activity\ncycle. High-degree (100 < l < 900) solar acoustic modes were analyzed using\nglobal helioseismology analysis techniques over most of solar cycle 23. We\nfollowed the methodology described in details in Korzennik, Rabello-Soares and\nSchou (2004) to infer unbiased estimates of high-degree mode parameters (see\nalso Rabello-Soares, Korzennik and Schou, 2006). We have removed most of the\nknown instrumental and observational effects that affect specifically\nhigh-degree modes. We show that the high-degree changes are in good agreement\nwith the medium-degree results, except for years when the instrument was highly\ndefocused. We analyzed and discuss the effect of defocusing on high degree\nestimation. Our results for high-degree modes confirm that the frequency shift\nscaled by the relative mode inertia is a function of frequency and it is\nindependent of degree.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The flyby anomalies are unexplained velocity increases of 3.9, 13.5, 0.1 and\n1.8 mm/s observed near closest approach during the Earth flybys of the Galileo,\nNEAR, Cassini and Rosetta spacecraft. Here, these flybys are modelled using a\ntheory that assumes that inertia is caused by a form of Unruh radiation,\nmodified by a Hubble-scale Casimir effect. This theory predicts that when the\ncraft's accelerations relative to the galactic centre approached zero near\nclosest approach, their inertial masses reduced for about 10^-7 s causing\nEarthward jumps of 2.6, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.9 mm/s respectively, and, to conserve\nangular momentum, increases in orbital velocity of a few mm/s that, except\nNEAR's, were quite close to those observed. However, these results were\nextremely sensitive to the Hubble constant used. As an experimental test of\nthese ideas, it is proposed that metamaterials could be used to bend Unruh\nradiation around objects, possibly reducing their inertial mass.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We employ high-spatial resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the\nSolar Optical Telescope on-board the Hinode spacecraft to investigate the fine\nstructure of the penumbral magnetic fields. The Stokes vector of two neutral\niron lines at 630 nm is inverted at every spatial pixel to retrieve the\ndepth-dependence of the magnetic field vector, line-of-sight velocity and\nthermodynamic parameters. We show that the azimuthal angle of the magnetic\nfield vector has opposite sign on both sides above the penumbral filaments.\nThis is consistent with the wrapping of an inclined field around the horizontal\nfilaments. The wrapping effect is stronger for filaments with larger horizontal\nextensions. In addition, we find that the external magnetic field can penetrate\ninto the intraspines, leading to non-radial magnetic fields inside them. These\nfindings shed some light on the controversial small-scale structure of the\nsunspot penumbra.",

The solar-system gravitational\nfield is determined by three factors: the dynamic distribution of matter in the\nsolar system; the dynamic distribution of matter outside the solar system\n(galactic, cosmological, etc.) and gravitational waves propagating through the\nsolar system. Different relativistic theories of gravity make different\npredictions of the solar-system gravitational field. Hence, precise\nmeasurements of the solar-system gravitational field test all these. The tests\nand observations include: (i) a precise determination of the relativistic\nparameters beta and gamma with 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement over\nprevious measurements; (ii) a 1-2 order of magnitude improvement in the\nmeasurement of G-dot; (iii) a precise determination of any anomalous, constant\nacceleration Aa directed towards the Sun; (iv) a measurement of solar angular\nmomentum via the Lense-Thirring effect; (v) the detection of solar g-mode\noscillations via their changing gravity field, thus, providing a new eye to see\ninside the Sun; (vi) precise determination of the planetary orbit elements and\nmasses; (viii) better determination of the orbits and masses of major\nasteroids; (ix) detection and observation of gravitational waves from massive\nblack holes and galactic binary stars in the frequency range 0.05 mHz to 5 mHz;\nand (x) exploring background gravitational-waves.",

In this paper we demonstrate that\na sufficiently advanced civilization could, in principal, manipulate the radius\nof the extra dimension to locally adjust the value of the cosmological\nconstant. This adjustment could be tuned to generate an expansion/contraction\nof spacetime around a spacecraft creating an exotic form of field-propulsion.\nDue to the fact that spacetime expansion itself is not restricted by\nrelativity, a faster-than-light 'warp drive' could be created. Calculations of\nthe energy requirements of such a drive are performed and an 'ultimate' speed\nlimit, based on the Planckian limits on the size of the extra dimensions is\nfound.",
