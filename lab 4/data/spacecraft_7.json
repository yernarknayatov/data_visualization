    "abstract": "Abstract:  Active region EUV loops are believed to trace a subset of magnetic field\nlines through the corona. Malanushenko et al. (2009) proposed a method, using\nloop images and line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms, to infer the\nthree-dimensional shape and field strength along each loop. McCarthy et al.\n(2019) used this novel method to compute the total magnetic flux\ninterconnecting a pair of active regions observed by SDO/AIA. They adopted the\ncommon assumption that each loop had a circular cross section. The accuracy of\ninferred shape and circularity of cross sections can both be tested using\nobservations of the same loops from additional vantage points as provided by\nSTEREO/EUVI. Here, we use multiple viewing angles to confirm the\nthree-dimensional structure of loops. Of 151 viable cases, 105 (69.5%) matched\nsome form of visible coronal structure when viewed approximately in quadrature.\nA loop with a circular cross-section should appear of a similar width in\ndifferent perspectives. In contradiction to this, we find a puzzling lack of\ncorrelation between loop diameters seen from different perspectives, even an\nanti-correlation in some cases. Features identified as monolithic loops in AIA\nmay, in fact, be more complex density enhancements. The 30.5% of\nreconstructions from AIA which did not match any feature in EUVI might be such\nenhancements. Others may be genuine loop structures, but with elliptical cross\nsections. We observe an anti-correlation between diameter and brightness,\nlending support to the latter hypothesis. Of 13 suitable for width analysis,\nfour loops are consistent with non-circular cross sections, where we find\nanti-correlation in both comparisons.",

In 2019, the OSIRIS-REx team selected primary and backup\nsample collection sites, called Nightingale and Osprey, respectively. On\nOctober 20, 2020, OSIRIS-REx successfully collected material from Nightingale.\nIn this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning classification through\nthe K-Means algorithm to spectrophotometrically characterize the surface of\nBennu, and in particular Nightingale and Osprey. We first analyze a global\nmosaic of Bennu, from which we find four clusters scattered across the surface,\nreduced to three when we normalize the images at 550 nm. The three spectral\nclusters are associated with boulders and show significant differences in\nspectral slope and UV value. We do not see evidence of latitudinal\nnon-uniformity, which suggests that Bennu's surface is well-mixed. In our\nhigher-resolution analysis of the primary and backup sample sites, we find\nthree representative normalized clusters, confirming an inverse correlation\nbetween reflectance and spectral slope (the darkest areas being the reddest\nones) and between b' normalized reflectance and slope. Nightingale and Osprey\nare redder than the global surface of Bennu by more than $1\\sigma$ from\naverage, consistent with previous findings, with Nightingale being the reddest\n($S' = (- 0.3 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{- 3}$ percent per thousand angstroms). We see\nhints of a weak absorption band at 550 nm at the candidate sample sites and\nglobally, which lends support to the proposed presence of magnetite on Bennu.",

We\nfocus on the Lagrange equilibrium points $L_1$ and $L_2$. There are families of\nLyapunov periodic orbits around either $L_1$ or $L_2$, forming Lyapunov\nmanifolds. There also exist homoclinic orbits to the Lyapunov manifolds around\neither $L_1$ or $L_2$, as well as heteroclinic orbits between the Lyapunov\nmanifold around $L_1$ and the one around $L_2$. The motion along the\nhomoclinic/heteroclinic orbits can be described via the scattering map, which\ngives the future asymptotic of a homoclinic orbit as a function of the past\nasymptotic. In contrast with the more customary Melnikov theory, we do not need\nto assume that the asymptotic orbits have a special nature (periodic,\nquasi-periodic, etc.).\nWe add a non-conservative, time-dependent perturbation, as a model for a\nthrust applied to the spacecraft for some duration of time, or for some other\neffect, such as solar radiation pressure. We compute the first order\napproximation of the perturbed scattering map, in terms of fast convergent\nintegrals of the perturbation along homoclinic/heteroclinic orbits of the\nunperturbed system. As a possible application, this result can be used to\ndetermine the trajectory of the spacecraft upon using the thrust.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A variety of kinetic waves develop in the solar wind. The relationship\nbetween these waves and larger-scale structures, such as current sheets and\nongoing turbulence remain a topic of investigation. Similarly, the\ninstabilities producing ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind remains an open\nquestion. The goals of this paper are to investigate kinetic electrostatic\nLangmuir and ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind at 0.5 AU and determine\nwhether current sheets and associated streaming instabilities can produce the\nobserved waves. The relationship between these waves and currents is\ninvestigated statistically. Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves instrument\nsuite provides high-resolution snapshots of the fluctuating electric field. The\nLow Frequency Receiver resolves the waveforms of ion-acoustic waves and the\nTime Domain Sampler resolves the waveforms of both ion-acoustic and Langmuir\nwaves. Using these waveform data we determine when these waves are observed in\nrelation to current structures in the solar wind, estimated from the background\nmagnetic field. Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves are frequently observed in the\nsolar wind. Ion-acoustic waves are observed about 1% of the time at 0.5 AU. The\nwaves are more likely to be observed in regions of enhanced currents. However,\nthe waves typically do not occur at current structures themselves. The observed\ncurrents in the solar wind are too small to drive instability by the relative\ndrift between single ion and electron populations. When multi-component ion\nand/or electron distributions are present the observed currents may be\nsufficient for instability. Ion beams are the most plausible source of\nion-acoustic waves. The spacecraft potential is confirmed to be a reliable\nprobe of the background electron density by comparing the peak frequencies of\nLangmuir waves with the plasma frequency calculated from the spacecraft\npotential.",

The four MMS\nspacecraft were separated by several hundred km, comparable to suprathermal ion\ngyro-radius scales or several ion inertial lengths.

This\nmodel is constructed from a catalogue of reconnection events which covers three\nyears of observations with a total of 2093 classified events, categorized into\nplasmoids, travelling compression regions and dipolarizations. This neural\nnetwork model is capable of rapidly identifying reconnection events in large\ntime-span Cassini datasets, tested against the full year 2010 with a high level\nof accuracy (87%), true skill score (0.76), and Heidke skill score (0.73).

This review\nstarts by introducing the planet Mercury, including its interplanetary\nenvironment, magnetosphere, exosphere, and conducting core. The frequent and\nintense magnetic reconnection on the dayside magnetopause, which is represented\nby the flux transfer event \"shower\", is reviewed on how they depend on\nmagnetosheath plasma beta and magnetic shear angle across the magnetopause,\nfollowing by how they contribute to the flux circulation and\nmagnetosphere-surface-exosphere coupling. In the next, the progress of\nMercury's magnetosphere under extreme solar events, including the core\ninduction and the reconnection erosion on the dayside magnetosphere, the\nresponses of the nightside magnetosphere, are reviewed. Then, the dawn-dusk\nproperties of the plasma sheet, including the features of the ions, the\nstructure of the current sheet, and the dynamics of magnetic reconnection, are\nsummarized. The last topic reviews the particle energization in Mercury's\nmagnetosphere, which includes the energization of the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves on\nthe magnetopause boundaries, reconnection-generated magnetic structures, and\nthe cross-tail electric field. In each chapter, the last section discusses the\nopen questions related with each topic, which can be considered by the\nsimulations and the future spacecraft mission. We close by summarizing the\nfuture BepiColombo opportunities, which is a joint mission between ESA and\nJAXA, and is en route to Mercury.",

This\nallows us to test the validity of our flux rope model on a larger and more\nglobal scale and allows for cross-validation of the analysis with different\nspacecraft combinations. Finally, we can also compare the results from the in\nsitu modeling to remote observations obtained from the STEREO-A heliospheric\nimagers. We make use of the 3D coronal rope ejection model in order to simulate\nthe ICME evolution. We adapt a previously developed ABC-SMC fitting algorithm\nfor the application to multi point scenarios. We show that we are able to\ngenerally reconstruct the flux ropes signatures at three different spacecraft\npositions simultaneously using our model in combination with the flux rope\nfitting algorithm. For the well-behaved 19th of April ICME our approach works\nvery well. The 28th of May ICME, on the other hand, shows the limitations of\nour approach. Unfortunately, the usage of multi-point observations for these\nevents does not appear to solve inherent issues, such as the estimation of the\nmagnetic field twist or flux rope aspect-ratios due to the specific\nconstellation of the spacecraft positions. As our general approach can be used\nfor any fast forward simulation-based model we give a blueprint for future\nstudies using more advanced ICME models.",

MMX will carry the Circum-Martian Dust Monitor\n(CMDM) which is a newly developed light-weight ($\\mathrm{650\\,g}$) large area\n($\\mathrm{1\\,m^2}$) dust impact detector. Cometary meteoroid streams (also\nreferred to as trails) exist along the orbits of comets, forming fine\nstructures of the interplanetary dust cloud. The streams consist predominantly\nof the largest cometary particles (with sizes of approximately\n$\\mathrm{100\\,\\mu m}$ to 1~cm) which are ejected at low speeds and remain very\nclose to the comet orbit for several revolutions around the Sun. The\nInterplanetary Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust streams in\nspace model is a new and recently published universal model for cometary\nmeteoroid streams in the inner Solar System. We use IMEX to study the detection\nconditions of cometary dust stream particles with CMDM during the MMX mission\nin the time period 2024 to 2028. The model predicts traverses of 12 cometary\nmeteoroid streams with fluxes of $\\mathrm{100\\,\\mu m}$ and bigger particles of\nat least $\\mathrm{10^{-3}\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$ during a total time period of\napproximately 90~days. The highest flux of $\\mathrm{0.15\\,m^{-2}\\,day^{-1}}$ is\npredicted for comet 114P/Wiseman-Skiff in October 2026. With its large\ndetection area and high sensitivity CMDM will be able to detect cometary\nmeteoroid streams en route to Phobos. Our simulation results for the Mars\norbital phase of MMX also predict the occurrence of meteor showers in the\nMartian atmosphere which may be observable from the Martian surface with\ncameras on board landers or rovers. Finally, the IMEX model can be used to\nstudy the impact hazards imposed by meteoroid impacts on to large-area\nspacecraft structures that will be particularly necessary for crewed deep space\nmissions.",

Inward-propagating density fluctuations in polar coronal holes were\ndetected by the COR2 coronagraph on board the STEREO-A spacecraft at\nheliocentric distances of 7 to 12 solar radii, and these fluctuations appear to\nundergo substantial deceleration as they move closer to the Sun. Models of\nlinear magnetohydrodynamic waves have not been able to explain these\ndeceleration patterns, so they have been interpreted more recently as jets from\ncoronal sites of magnetic reconnection. In this paper, we develop a range of\ndynamical models of discrete plasma parcels with the goal of better\nunderstanding the observed deceleration trend. We found that parcels with a\nconstant mass do not behave like the observed flows, and neither do parcels\nundergoing ablative mass loss. However, parcels that accrete mass in a\nsnowplow-like fashion can become decelerated as observed. We also extrapolated\nOMNI in situ data down to the so-called Alfven surface and found that the\ninitial launch-point for the observed parcels may often be above this critical\nradius. In other words, in order for the parcels to flow back down to the Sun,\ntheir initial speeds are probably somewhat nonlinear (i.e., supra-Alfvenic) and\nthus the parcels may be associated with structures such as shocks, jets, or\nshear instabilities.",

We use\nPSP velocity and magnetic field measurements from 24 h intervals selected from\neach of the first four encounters. The applicability of TH is investigated by\nmeasuring the parameter $\\epsilon=\\delta u_0/\\sqrt{2}V_\\perp$, which quantifies\nthe ratio between the typical speed of large-scale fluctuations, $\\delta u_0$,\nand the local perpendicular PSP speed in the solar wind frame, $V_\\perp$.

The\nspectral indices determined from power-law fits of the measured frequency\nspectrum accurately represent the spectral indices associated with the\nunderlying spatial spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the plasma frame.\nAside from a frequency broadening due to large-scale sweeping that requires\ncareful consideration, the spatial spectrum can be recovered to obtain the\ndistribution of fluctuation's energy among scales in the plasma frame.",

We use observations taken with the\nspectropolarimeter onboard the Hinode spacecraft as a test benchmark. First, we\ncarefully analyze the data with the SIR inversion code using a given initial\natmospheric model. The code provides a set of atmospheric models that reproduce\nthe observations. These models are then used to train a CNN. Afterwards, the\nsame data are again inverted with SIR but using the trained CNN to provide the\ninitial guess atmospheric models for SIR. The CNNs allow us to significantly\nreduce the number of inversion cycles when used to compute initial guess model\natmospheres, decreasing the computational time for LTE inversions by a factor\nof two to four. CNN's alone are much faster than assisted inversions, but the\nlatter are more robust and accurate. The advantages and limitations of machine\nlearning techniques for estimating optimum initial atmospheric models for\nspectral line inversions are discussed. Finally, we describe a python wrapper\nfor the SIR and DeSIRe codes that allows for the easy setup of parallel\ninversions. The assisted inversions can speed up the inversion process, but the\nefficiency and accuracy of the inversion results depend strongly on the solar\nscene and the data used for the CNN training.

The space logistics technique enables modeling of the on-orbit\nservicing logistical operations as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program whose optimal\nsolutions can efficiently be found. The Rolling Horizon approach enables the\nassessment of the long-term value of an on-orbit servicing infrastructure by\naccounting for the uncertain service needs that arise over time among the\ngeostationary satellites. Two case studies successfully demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the framework for (1) short-term operational scheduling and\n(2) long-term strategic decision making for on-orbit servicing architectures\nunder diverse market conditions.",

Each spacecraft pair\nwill establish a 1.7*10^5 km-long laser interferometer immersed in the solar\nwind and the magnetospheric plasmas to measure the phase deviations induced by\nthe GW. GW detection requires a high-precision measurement of the laser phase.\nThe cumulative effects of the long distance and the periodic oscillations of\nthe plasma density may induce an additional phase noise.

Preliminary results show that the plasma density oscillation can\ninduce the phase deviations close to 2*10^-6 rad/Hz^1/2 or 0.3pm/Hz^1/2 in the\nmilli-hertz frequency band and it is within the error budget assigned to the\ndisplacement noise of the interferometry. The amplitude spectrum density of\nphases along three arms become more separated when the orbital plane is\nparallel to the Sun-Earth line or during a magnetic storm.

The spacecraft experiences a stream of\nMeV/nucleon impacts along the forward edge primarily from hydrogen and helium\nnuclei. The accumulation of implanted slowly diffusing gas atoms in solids\ndrives damage through the meso-scale processes of bubble formation, blistering,\nand exfoliation. This results in macroscopic changes to material properties\nand, in the cases of blistering and exfoliation, material erosion via blister\nrupture and delamination. Relativistic hydrogen and helium at constant velocity\nwill stop in the material at a similar depth, as predicted by Bethe-Bloch\nstopping and subsequent simulations of the implantation distribution, leading\nto a mixed hydrogen and helium system similar to that observed in fusion\nplasma-facing components (PFC's). However, the difference in location of\nnear-surface gas atoms with respect to the direction of exposure means that\npreviously developed empirical models of blistering cannot be used to predict\nbubble formation or blistering onset. In this work, we present a model of the\nlocal gas concentration threshold for material blistering from exposure to the\nISM at relativistic speeds. Expected effects on the spacecraft and mitigation\nstrategies are also discussed. The same considerations apply to the\nBreakthrough Starshot mission.",

The existing schemes solely relying on far-field\nthermal radiation, which are based on mechanical, electrochromic or\nthermochromic working principles, are difficult to combine the advantages of\nall-solid-state structure, actively and accurate tuning, and large tuning range\nof heat flux. In this work, we propose a near-field radiation assisted (NFRA)\nsmart skin for thermal control which can tune the heat rejection accurately and\nin a large range. It contains a metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structure,\nwhere the carrier distribution in the semiconductor layer can be electrically\naltered. In this way, the near-field heat flux, and ultimately the skin\nemission power expressed using effective emittance, can be controlled as a\nfunction of the applied voltage. The variation range of the effective emittance\ncan exceed 0.7 when adjusting the applied voltage from -10 V to 100 V with our\npreliminary design.

All of the aligned sequences, which\nwere corrected from the satellite motions and tracked with the differential\nrotation, were used to detect the long-lasting downflows in the quiet-Sun at\nthe disc centre. To learn about the structure of the flows below the solar\nsurface, the time-distance local helioseismology was used.\nThe inspection of the 3D data cube (x, y, t) of the 24-hour Doppler sequence\nallowed us to detect 13 persistent downflows. Their lifetimes lie in the range\nbetween 3.5 and 20 hours with sizes between 2\" and 3\" and speeds between -0.25\nand -0.72 km/s. These persistent downflows are always filled with the magnetic\nfield with an amplitude of up to 600 G. The helioseismic inversion allows us to\ndescribe the persistent downflows and compare them to the other\n(non-persistent) downflows in the field of view. The persistent downflows seem\nto penetrate much deeper and, in the case of a well-formed vortex, the\nvorticity keeps its integrity to the depth of about 5 Mm. In the MHD\nsimulation, only sub-arcsecond downflows are detected with no evidence of a\nvortex comparable in size to observations at the surface of the Sun.\nThe long temporal sequences from the space-borne allow us to show the\nexistence of long-persistent downflows together with the magnetic field. They\npenetrate inside the Sun but are also connected with the anchoring of coronal\nloops in the photosphere, indicating a link between downflows and the coronal\nactivity. A link suggests that EUV cyclones over the quiet Sun could be an\neffective way to heat the corona.",

The main criteria for this selection period is to\nobtain height-time measurements of the CMEs without significant projection\neffects and in a very large field of view. Using the data from STEREO/Sun Earth\nConnection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (STEREO / SECCHI) images we\ndetermined several kinematic parameters and instantaneous speeds of the CMEs.\nFirst, we compare instantaneous CME speed and Mach number versus SEP fluxes for\nevents originating at the western and eastern limb we observe high correlation\nfor the western events and anticorrelation for the eastern events. Next we\ninvestigated instantaneous CME kinematic parameters such as maximum speed,\nmaximum Mach number, and the CME speed and Mach number at SEP peak flux versus\nSEP peak fluxes. Highly positive correlation is observed for Mach number at SEP\npeak flux for all events. The obtained instantaneous Furthermore, we conducted\nestimates of delay in time and distance between CME, SEP, and shock parameters.\nComparative studies of the considered energy channels of the SEPs also throw\nlight on the reacceleration of suprathermal seed ions by CME-driven shocks that\nare pre-accelerated in the magnetic reconnection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Aims. We present observations of the first coronal mass ejection (CME)\nobserved at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft on April 19, 2020, and the associated\nForbush decrease (FD) measured by its High Energy Telescope (HET). This CME is\na multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods. We\nhighlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of\nthe galactic cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The\nanalytical ForbMod model is applied to the FD measurements to reproduce the\nForbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for the model are derived\nfrom both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The very\nslow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the\nlow-energy cosmic ray measurements at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of\nthe Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor\nmeasurements. Significant differences are observed in the expansion behavior of\nthe CME at different locations, which may be related to influence of the\nfollowing high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions, ForbMod is\nable to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from\nHET as well as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not\nagree with the FD amplitudes at higher energies measured by neutron monitors on\nEarth. We study these discrepancies and provide possible explanations.\nConclusions. This study highlights that the novel measurements of the Solar\nOrbiter can be coordinated with other spacecraft to improve our understanding\nof space weather in the inner heliosphere. Multi-spacecraft observations\ncombined with data-based modeling are also essential to understand the\npropagation and evolution of CMEs as well as their space weather impacts.",

The simulation reproduces the solar wind configuration\nand the energetic particle enhancements observed by both spacecraft.

The\nsimulation confirms that the acceleration process does not require shock waves\nand can already commence within Earth's orbit, with an energy dependence on the\nprecise location where particles are accelerated.

Current state-of-the-art methods leverage traditional computer vision\napproaches to automate identification of safe terrain from input digital\nelevation models (DEMs). However, performance for these methods can degrade for\ninput DEMs with increased sensor noise. At the same time, deep learning\ntechniques have been developed for various applications. Nevertheless, their\napplicability to safety-critical space missions has been often limited due to\nconcerns regarding their outputs' reliability. In response to this background,\nthis paper proposes an uncertainty-aware learning-based method for hazard\ndetection and landing site selection. The developed approach enables reliable\nsafe landing site selection by: (i) generating a safety prediction map and its\nuncertainty map together via Bayesian deep learning and semantic segmentation;\nand (ii) using the generated uncertainty map to filter out the uncertain pixels\nin the prediction map so that the safe landing site selection is performed only\nbased on the certain pixels (i.e., pixels for which the model is certain about\nits safety prediction). Experiments are presented with simulated data based on\na Mars HiRISE digital terrain model and varying noise levels to demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed approach.",

Without loss of\ngenerality, a free fall disk in water is considered, whose motion is governed\nby the Andersen-Pesavento-Wang model. We illustrate that convergent and\nreliable trajectories of a chaotic free fall disk in a long enough interval of\ntime can be obtained by means of the CNS, but different traditional algorithms\nin double precision give disparate trajectories. Besides, unlike the\ntraditional algorithms in double precision, the CNS can predict the accurate\nposture of the free fall disk near the vicinity of the bifurcation point of\nsome physical parameters in a long duration. Therefore, the CNS can provide\nreliable prediction of chaotic systems in a long enough interval of time.",

We retain a full scale-dependent approach in our\ntreatment, and consider the case in which electric-field fluctuations can be\ndescribed by a generalized Ohm's law that includes Hall and thermo-electric\neffects. These two electric-field terms provide the dominant contributions to\nstochastic ion heating when the ion-Larmor scale is much smaller than the ion\nskin depth, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{i}}\\ll d_{\\mathrm{i}}$, which is the case at\n$\\beta{\\ll}1$. Employing well-known spectral scaling laws for Alfv\u00e9n-wave and\nkinetic-Alfv\u00e9n-wave turbulent fluctuations, we obtain scaling relations\ncharacterizing the field-perpendicular particle-energization rate and energy\ndiffusion coefficient associated with stochastic heating in these two regimes.\nPhase-space signatures of ion heating are then investigated using 3D\nhybrid-kinetic simulations of continuously driven Alfv\u00e9nic turbulence at low\n$\\beta$. In these simulations, energization of ions parallel to the magnetic\nfield is sub-dominant compared to its perpendicular counterpart\n($Q_{\\parallel,\\mathrm{i}}\\ll Q_{\\perp,\\mathrm{i}}$), and the fraction of\nturbulent energy that goes into ion heating is ${\\approx}75$\\% at\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{i}}=0.3$ and ${\\approx}40$\\% at\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{i}}{\\simeq}0.1$. The phase-space signatures of ion energization\nare consistent with Landau-resonant collisionless damping and a\n($\\beta$-dependent) combination of ion-cyclotron and stochastic heating. We\ndemonstrate good agreement between our theory and various signatures associated\nwith the stochastic portion of the heating.

This means particle distributions are not typically\nin thermodynamic equilibrium and deviate significantly from Maxwellian\ndistributions. The deviations of these distributions can be further enhanced by\nplasma processes, such as shocks, turbulence, and magnetic reconnection. Such\ndistributions can be unstable to a wide variety of kinetic plasma\ninstabilities, which in turn modify the electron distributions. In this paper\nthe deviations of the observed electron distributions from a bi-Maxwellian\ndistribution function is calculated and quantified using data from the\nMagnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft. A statistical study from tens of\nmillions of electron distributions shows that the primary source of the\nobserved non-Maxwellianity are electron distributions consisting of distinct\nhot and cold components in Earth's low-density magnetosphere. This results in\nlarge non-Maxwellianities in at low densities. However, after performing a\nstastical study we find regions where large non-Maxwellianities are observed\nfor a given density. Highly non-Maxwellian distributions are routinely found\nare Earth's bowshock, in Earth's outer magnetosphere, and in the electron\ndiffusion regions of magnetic reconnection. Enhanced non-Maxwellianities are\nobserved in the turbulent magnetosheath, but are intermittent and are not\ncorrelated with local processes.
