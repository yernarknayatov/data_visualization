    "abstract": "Abstract:  We conducted the high-resolution spectroscopic observation with Subaru/HDS\nfor a G-type star (KIC6934317). We selected this star from the data of the\nKepler spacecraft. This star produces a lot of superflares, and the total\nenergy of the largest superflare on this star is ~10^3 times larger (~2.2*10^35\nerg) than that of the most energetic flare on the Sun (~10^32 erg). The core\ndepth and emission flux of Ca II infrared triplet lines and Ha line show high\nchromospheric activity in this star, in spite of its low lithium abundance and\nthe small amplitude of the rotational modulation. Using the empirical relations\nbetween emission flux of chromospheric lines and X-ray flux, this star is\nconsidered to show much higher coronal activity than that of the Sun. It\nprobably has large starspots which can store a large amount of magnetic energy\nenough to give rise to superflares. We also estimated the stellar parameters,\nsuch as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, projected\nrotational velocity (v sin_i), and radial velocity. KIC6934317 is then\nconfirmed to be an early G-type main sequence star. The value of v sin_i is\nestimated to be ~1.91 km s^-1. In contrast, the rotational velocity is\ncalculated to be ~20 km s^-1 by using the period of the brightness variation as\nthe rotation period. This difference can be explained by its small inclination\nangle (nearly pole-on). The small inclination angle is also supported by the\ncontrast between the large superflare amplitude and the small stellar\nbrightness variation amplitude. The lithium abundance and isochrones implies\nthat the age of this star is more than about a few Gyr, though a problem why\nthis star with such an age has a strong activity remains unsolved.",

Simultaneous measurements\nincluded the sampling of a full planetary rotation, a relevant timescale to\ninvestigate auroral emissions driven by processes internal to the\nmagnetosphere. In addition, this interval coincidently matched a powerful\nsubstorm-like event in the magnetotail, which induced an overall dawnside\nintensification of the magnetospheric and auroral activity. We comparatively\nanalyze this unique set of measurements to reach a comprehensive view of\nkronian auroral processes over the investigated timescale. We identify three\nsource regions in atmospheric aurorae, including a main oval associated with\nthe bulk of Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), together with polar and\nequatorward emissions. These observations reveal the co-existence of\ncorotational and sub-corototational dynamics of emissions associated with the\nmain auroral oval. Precisely, we show that the atmospheric main oval hosts\nshort-lived sub-corotating isolated features together with a bright,\nlongitudinally extended, corotating region locked at the southern SKR phase. We\nassign the susbtorm-like event to a regular, internally driven, nightside ion\ninjection possibly triggerred by a plasmoid ejection. We also investigate the\ntotal auroral energy budget, from the power input to the atmosphere,\ncharacterized by precipitating electrons up to 20 keV, to its dissipation\nthrough the various radiating processes. Finally, through simulations, we\nconfirm the search-light nature of the SKR rotational modulation and we show\nthat SKR arcs relate to isolated auroral spots.

This model solves the\nextended two temperature magnetohydrodynamics equations coupled to a wave\nkinetic equation for low frequency Alfv\u00e9n waves. In this picture, heating and\nacceleration of the plasma are due to wave dissipation and wave pressure\ngradients, respectively. The dissipation process is described by a fully\ndeveloped turbulent cascade of counter-propagating waves. We adopt a unified\napproach for calculating the wave dissipation in both open and closed magnetic\nfield lines, allowing for a self-consistent treatment of any magnetic topology.\nWave dissipation is the only heating mechanism assumed in the model, and no\ngeometric heating functions are invoked. Electron heat conduction and radiative\ncooling are also included. We demonstrate that the large-scale, steady-state\n(in the co-rotating frame) properties of the solar environment are reproduced,\nusing three adjustable parameters: the Poynting flux of chromospheric Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves, the perpendicular correlation length of the turbulence, and a\npseudo-reflection coefficient. We compare model results for Carrington Rotation\n2063 (November-December 2007) to remote observations in the EUV and X-ray\nranges from STEREO, SOHO and Hinode spacecraft, as well as to in-situ\nmeasurements performed by Ulysses.

The M1.8 flare produces, however, faint type III radio\nbursts. Whereas electrons of 25 to 300 keV are released 9 min later when a\njet-like CME travels to 2.6 solar radii. We further examine the coronal\nmagnetic configurations above the two ARs based on the potential field source\nsurface (PFSS) model. It is found that open field lines, rooted in AR10154 and\nwell connected to the Earth, provide escaping channels for energetic electrons.\nOnly a small portion of magnetic fields are opened above AR10160, being\nresponsible for the faint type III radio bursts. These lines are, however, not\nwell connected, making it impossible for SIEEs detection by near-Earth\nspacecraft.

Confirmation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)\nsuppression above ~4 x 10^19 eV suggests that most UHECR originate in\nastrophysical objects. Higher energy particles must come from sources within\nabout 100 Mpc and are deflected by ~1 degree by predicted\nintergalactic/galactic magnetic fields. The Pierre Auger Array, Telescope Array\nand the future JEM-EUSO ISS mission will open charged-particle astronomy, but\nmuch greater exposure will be required to fully identify and measure the\nspectra of individual sources. OWL uses two large telescopes with 3 m optical\napertures and 45 degree FOV in near-equatorial orbits.

On March 18, 2011,\nMESSENGER became the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. The radioscience\nobservations acquired during the orbital phase of MESSENGER drastically\nimproved our knowledge of the orbit of Mercury. An accurate MESSENGER orbit is\nobtained by fitting one-and-half years of tracking data using GINS orbit\ndetermination software. The systematic error in the Earth-Mercury geometric\npositions, also called range bias, obtained from GINS are then used to fit the\nINPOP dynamical modeling of the planet motions. An improved ephemeris of the\nplanets is then obtained, INPOP13a, and used to perform general relativity\ntests of PPN-formalism. Our estimations of PPN parameters (beta and gamma?) are\nmore stringent than previous results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We study for the first time a three-dimensional octahedron constellation for\na space-based gravitational wave detector, which we call the Octahedral\nGravitational Observatory (OGO). With six spacecraft the constellation is able\nto remove laser frequency noise and acceleration disturbances from the\ngravitational wave signal without needing LISA-like drag-free control, thereby\nsimplifying the payloads and placing less stringent demands on the thrusters.\nWe generalize LISA's time-delay interferometry to displacement-noise free\ninterferometry (DFI) by deriving a set of generators for those combinations of\nthe data streams that cancel laser and acceleration noise. However, the\nthree-dimensional configuration makes orbit selection complicated. So far, only\na halo orbit near the Lagrangian point L1 has been found to be stable enough,\nand this allows only short arms up to 1400 km. We derive the sensitivity curve\nof OGO with this arm length, resulting in a peak sensitivity of about\n$2\\times10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ near 100 Hz. We compare this version of\nOGO to the present generation of ground-based detectors and to some future\ndetectors. We also investigate the scientific potentials of such a detector,\nwhich include observing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences,\nthe stochastic background and pulsars as well as the possibility to test\nalternative theories of gravity. We find a mediocre performance level for this\nshort-arm-length detector, between those of initial and advanced ground-based\ndetectors. Thus, actually building a space-based detector of this specific\nconfiguration does not seem very efficient. However, when alternative orbits\nthat allow for longer detector arms can be found, a detector with much improved\nscience output could be constructed using the octahedron configuration and DFI\nsolutions demonstrated in this paper.

AR 11158, which consisted of two\nmajor emerging bipoles, showed prominent activities including one X- and\nseveral M-class flares. In order to investigate the magnetic structures related\nto the M6.6 event, particularly the formation process of a flare-triggering\nmagnetic region, we analyzed multiple spacecraft observations and numerical\nresults of a flare simulation. We observed that, in the center of this\nquadrupolar AR, a highly sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) was formed\nthrough proper motions of the major magnetic elements, which built a sheared\ncoronal arcade lying over the PIL. The observations lend support to the\ninterpretation that the target flare was triggered by a localized magnetic\nregion that had an intrusive structure, namely a positive polarity penetrating\ninto a negative counterpart. The geometrical relationship between the sheared\ncoronal arcade and the triggering region was consistent with the theoretical\nflare model based on the previous numerical study. We found that the formation\nof the trigger region was due to a continuous accumulation of the small-scale\nmagnetic patches. A few hours before the flare occurrence, the series of\nemerged/advected patches reconnected with a preexisting fields. Finally, the\nabrupt flare eruption of the M6.6 event started around 17:30 UT. Our analysis\nsuggests that, in a triggering process of a flare activity, all magnetic\nsystems of multiple scales, not only the entire AR evolution but also the fine\nmagnetic elements, are altogether involved.",

This is due to many factors which\nchange the CME kinematics, like interaction of two or more CMEs or the\ninteraction of CMEs with the pervading solar wind. In order to understand the\npropagation of CMEs, we have used the 3D triangulation method on SECCHI\ncoronagraph (COR2) images, and geometric triangulation on the J-maps\nconstructed from Heliospheric Imagers HI1 and HI2 images for eight\nEarth-directed CMEs observed during 2008-2010.

These arrival times have also been compared with the\nactual arrival time as observed by \\textit{in-situ} instruments. The analysis\nreveals the importance of heliospheric imaging for improved forecasting of the\narrival time and direction of propagation of CMEs in the interplanetary medium.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A 3-D coronal magnetic field is reconstructed for NOAA 11158 on Feb 14, 2011.\nA GPU-accelerated direct boundary integral equation (DBIE) method is\nimplemented. This is about 1000 times faster than the original DBIE used on\nsolar NLFFF modeling. Using the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram as the bottom\nboundary condition, the reconstructed magnetic field lines are compared with\nthe projected EUV loop structures from different views three-dimensionally by\nSDO/AIA and STEREO A/B spacecraft simultaneously for the first time. They show\nvery good agreement so that the topological configurations of the magnetic\nfields can be analyzed, thus its role in the flare process of the active region\ncan be better understood. A quantitative comparison with some stereoscopically\nreconstructed coronal loops shows that the present averaged misalignment angles\nare at the same order as the state-of-the-art results obtained with\nreconstructed coronal loops as prescribed conditions and better than other\nNLFFF methods. It is found that the observed coronal loop structures can be\ngrouped into bundles of closed and open loops with some central bright coronal\nloops around the polarity inversion line (PIL). The reconstructed\nhighly-shearing magnetic field lines agree very well with the low-lying\nS-shaped filament channel along PIL. They are in a pivot position to all other\nsurrounding coronal structures, and a group of electric current lines\nco-aligned with the central bright EUV loops overlying the filament channel is\nalso obtained. This central lower-lying magnetic field loop system must have\nplayed a key role in powering the flare. It should be noted that while a\nstrand-like coronal feature along PIL may be related to the filament, one\ncannot simply attribute all the coronal bright features along PIL to\nmanifestation of the filament without any stereoscopically information. It\nshows that DBIE is rigorous and effective.",

This has especially strong implications\nfor animals or vehicles needing to navigate sandy environments, which can sink\nand become stuck in a \"dry quicksand\" if their weight exceeds the yield stress\nof this fragile matter. While it is known that the contact stresses in these\nsystems are loaded by gravity, very little is known about the sinking dynamics\nof objects into loose granular systems under gravitational accelerations\ndifferent from the Earth's (g). A fundamental understanding of how objects sink\nin different gravitational environments is not only necessary for successful\nplanetary navigation and engineering, but it can also improve our understanding\nof celestial impact dynamics and crater geomorphology. Here we perform and\nexplain the first systematic experiments of the sink dynamics of objects into\ngranular media in different gravitational accelerations. By using an\naccelerating experimental apparatus, we explore gravitational conditions\nranging from 0.4g to 1.2g. With the aid of discrete element modeling\nsimulations, we reproduce these results and extend this range to include\nobjects as small as asteroids and as large as Jupiter. Surprisingly, we find\nthat the final sink depth is independent of the gravitational acceleration, an\nobservation with immediate relevance to the design of future extraterrestrial\nstructures land-roving spacecraft.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The NASA Dawn mission has extensively examined the surface of asteroid Vesta,\nthe second most massive body in the main belt. The high quality of the gathered\ndata provides us with an unique opportunity to determine the surface and\ninternal properties of one of the most important and intriguing main belt\nasteroids (MBAs). In this paper, we focus on the size frequency distributions\n(SFDs) of sub-kilometer impact craters observed at high spatial resolution on\nseveral selected young terrains on Vesta. These small crater populations offer\nan excellent opportunity to determine the nature of their asteroidal precursors\n(namely MBAs) at sizes that are not directly observable from ground-based\ntelescopes (i.e., below ~100 m diameter). Moreover, unlike many other MBA\nsurfaces observed by spacecraft thus far, the young terrains examined had\ncrater spatial densities that were far from empirical saturation. Overall, we\nfind that the cumulative power-law index (slope) of small crater SFDs on Vesta\nis fairly consistent with predictions derived from current collisional and\ndynamical models down to a projectile size of ~10 m diameter (Bottke et al.,\n2005a,b). The shape of the impactor SFD for small projectile sizes does not\nappear to have changed over the last several billions of years, and an argument\ncan be made that the absolute number of small MBAs has remained roughly\nconstant (within a factor of 2) over the same time period. The apparent steady\nstate nature of the main belt population potentially provides us with a set of\nintriguing constraints that can be used to glean insights into the physical\nevolution of individual MBAs as well as the main belt as an ensemble.",

In this study, we try to identify the\nacceleration source(s) of solar energetic particles by combining in situ\nparticle measurements from the WIND/3DP, GOES 13, and solar cosmic rays\nregistered by several NMs, as well as remote-sensing solar observations from\nSDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI. We derive the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) path length (1.25 +/- 0.05 AU) and solar particle release time (01:29 +/-\n00:01 UT) of the first arriving electrons by using their velocity dispersion\nand taking into account contamination effects. We found that the electron\nimpulsive injection phase, indicated by the dramatic change in the spectral\nindex, is consistent with flare non-thermal emission and type III radio bursts.\nBased on the potential field source surface concept, modeling of the open-field\nlines rooted in the active region has been performed to provide escape channels\nfor flare-accelerated electrons.Meanwhile, relativistic protons are found to be\nreleased 10 minutes later than the electrons, assuming their scatter-free\ntravel along the same IMF path length. Combining multi-wavelength imaging data\nof the prominence eruption and coronal mass ejection (CME), we obtain evidence\nthat GLE protons, with an estimated kinetic energy of 1.12 GeV, are probably\naccelerated by the CME-driven shock when it travels to 3.07 solar radii.

These librations have previously been studied\nfor a planet with two layers: a mantle and a liquid core. Here, we calculate\nhow the presence of a solid inner core in the liquid outer core influences the\nlong-period forced librations. Mantle-inner core coupling affects the\nlong-period libration dynamics mainly by changing the free libration: first, it\nlengthens the period of the free libration of the mantle, and second, it adds a\nsecond free libration, closely related to the free gravitational oscillation\nbetween the mantle and inner core. The two free librations have periods between\n2.5 and 18 y depending on the internal structure. We show that large amplitude\nlong-period librations of 10's of arcsec are generated when the period of a\nplanetary forcing approaches one of the two free libration periods. These\namplitudes are sufficiently large to be detectable by spacecraft measurements\nof the libration of Mercury. The amplitudes of the angular velocity of\nMercury's mantle at planetary forcing periods are also amplified by the\nresonances, but remain much smaller than the current precision of Earth-based\nradar observations unless the period is very close to a free libration period.\nThe inclusion of mantle-inner core coupling in the rotation model does not\nsignificantly improve the fit to the radar observations. This implies that it\nis not yet possible to determine the size of the inner core of Mercury on the\nbasis of available observations of Mercury's rotation rate. Future observations\nof the long-period librations may be used to constrain the interior structure\nof Mercury, including the size of its inner core.",

However, both imager and insitu data do not provide\ndirect estimation on the global flux rope properties. The main aim of this\nstudy is to constrain the global shape of the flux rope axis from local\nmeasurements, and to compare the results from in-situ data with imager\nobservations. We perform a statistical analysis of the set of MCs observed by\nWIND spacecraft over 15 years in the vicinity of Earth. With the hypothesis of\nhaving a sample of MCs with a uniform distribution of spacecraft crossing along\ntheir axis, we show that a mean axis shape can be derived from the distribution\nof the axis orientation. In complement, while heliospheric imagers do not\ntypically observe MCs but only their sheath region, we analyze one event where\nthe flux-rope axis can be estimated from the STEREO imagers. From the analysis\nof a set of theoretical models, we show that the distribution of the local axis\norientation is strongly affected by the global axis shape. Next, we derive the\nmean axis shape from the integration of the observed orientation distribution.\nThis shape is robust as it is mostly determined from the global shape of the\ndistribution. Moreover, we find no dependence on the flux-rope inclination on\nthe ecliptic. Finally, the derived shape is fully consistent with the one\nderived from heliospheric imager observations of the June 2008 event. We have\nderived a mean shape of MC axis which only depends on one free parameter, the\nangular separation of the legs (as viewed from the Sun). This mean shape can be\nused in various contexts such as the study of high energy particles or space\nweather forecast.",

The observational\nchallenges of these measurements require dedicated instrumentation and only the\nspace environment allows an undisturbed access to earth-like atmospheric\nfeatures such as water or carbon-dioxide. Therefore, several exoplanet-specific\nspace missions are currently being studied. One of them is EChO, the Exoplanet\nCharacterization Observatory, which is part of ESA's Cosmic Vision 2015-2025\nprogram, and which is one of four candidates for the M3 launch slot in 2024. In\nthis paper we present the results of our assessment study of the EChO\nspectrometer, the only science instrument onboard this spacecraft. The\ninstrument is a multi-channel all-reflective dispersive spectrometer, covering\nthe wavelength range from 400 nm to 16 microns simultaneously with a moderately\nlow spectral resolution. We illustrate how the key technical challenge of the\nEChO mission - the high photometric stability - influences the choice of\nspectrometer concept and drives fundamentally the instrument design. First\nperformance evaluations underline the fitness of the elaborated design solution\nfor the needs of the EChO mission.",

The waves in both frequency ranges had large\namplitudes, but the higher frequency waves, which are the focus of this study,\nshowed larger contributions to both the Poynting flux and the energy\ndissipation rates. The higher frequency waves were identified as combinations\nof ion-acoustic waves, electron cyclotron drift instability driven waves,\nelectrostatic solitary waves, and whistler mode waves. These waves were found\nto have: (1) amplitudes capable of exceeding dB ~ 10 nT and dE ~ 300 mV/m,\nthough more typical values were dB ~ 0.1-1.0 nT and dE ~ 10-50 mV/m; (2) energy\nfluxes in excess of 2000 x 10^(-6) W m^(-2); (3) resistivities > 9000 Ohm m;\nand (4) energy dissipation rates > 3 x 10^(-6) W m^(-3). The dissipation rates\nwere found to be in excess of four orders of magnitude greater than was\nnecessary to explain the increase in entropy across the shocks. Thus, the waves\nneed only be, at times, < 0.01% efficient to balance the nonlinear wave\nsteepening that produces the shocks. Therefore, these results show for the\nfirst time that high frequency electromagnetic and electrostatic waves have the\ncapacity to regulate the global structure of collisionless shocks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Results of the analysis of spacecraft measurements at 1-5.4 AU are presented\nwithin the scope of the large-scale interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nstructure investigation. The work is focused on revealing of the radial IMF\ncomponent (Br) variations with heliocentric distance and latitude as seen by\nUlysses. It was found out that |Br| decreases as ~r^-5/3 in the ecliptic plane\nvicinity (10 deg. of latitude). This is consistent with the previous results\nobtained on the basis of five spacecraft in-ecliptic measurements (Khabarova,\nObridko, 2012). The difference between the experimentally found (r^-5/3) and\ncommonly used (r^-2) radial dependence of Br may lead to mistakes in the IMF\nrecalculations from point to point in the heliosphere. This can be one of the\nmain sources of the 'magnetic flux excess' effect, which is exceeding of the\ndistantly measured magnetic flux over the values obtained through the\nmeasurements at the Earth orbit. It is shown that the radial IMF component can\nbe considered as independent of heliolatitude in a rough approximation only.\nMore detailed analysis demonstrates an expressed |Br| (as well as the IMF\nstrength) increase in the latitudinal vicinity of 30 deg. relative to the\necliptic plane. Also, a slight increase of the both parameters is observed in\nthe polar solar wind. The analysis of the latitudinal and radial dependences of\nthe Br distribution's bimodality is performed. The investigation has not\nrevealed any dependence between Br and the solar wind speed V. Meanwhile, the\ntwo-peak distribution of the solar wind speed as measured by Ulysses is a\nconsequence of a strong latitudinal and solar cycle dependence of V. It is\nshown that the solar wind speed in high latitudes (above 40 deg.)\nanti-correlates with a solar activity: V is maximal during the solar cycle\nminima, and it has a minimum at the maximum of solar activity.",

We developed a numerical code, also\nused for studying the geophysical history of Vesta (Formisano et al.,\nsubmitted), to explore several scenarios of internal evolution of Lutetia,\ndiffering in the strength of radiogenic sources and in the global\npost-sintering porosity. The only significant heat source for partial\ndifferentiation is represented by Al26, the other possible sources (Fe60,\naccretion and differentiation) being negligible. In scenarios in which Lutetia\ncompleted its accretion in less than 0.7 Ma from injection of Al26 in Solar\nNebula and for post-sintering values of macroporosity not exceeding 30 vol. %,\nthe asteroid experienced only partial differentiation. The formation of the\nproto-core, a structure enriched in metals and also containing pristine\nsilicates, requires from 1 to 4 Ma: the size of the proto-core varies from 6 to\n30 km.",

With the exception of a handful of objects, the physical nature,\nand specifically the average densities, of these bodies remain unknown. Here,\nwe propose that the detected giant planet radii may partially belong to planets\nsomewhat less massive than Uranus and Neptune. Accordingly, in this work, we\nseek to identify a physically sound upper limit to planetary radii at low\nmasses and moderate equilibrium temperatures. As a guiding example, we analyze\nthe interior structure of the Neptune-mass planet Kepler-30d and show that it\nis acutely deficient in heavy elements, especially compared with its solar\nsystem counterparts. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations of\nplanetary thermal evolution and in agreement with previous studies, show that\ngenerally, 10 - 20 Earth mass, multi-billion year old planets, composed of high\ndensity cores and extended H/He envelopes can have radii that firmly reside in\nthe giant planet range. We subject our results to stability criteria based on\nextreme ultraviolet radiation, as well as Roche-lobe overflow driven mass-loss\nand construct mass-radius relationships for the considered objects. We conclude\nby discussing observational avenues that may be used to confirm or repudiate\nthe existence of putative low mass, gas-dominated planets.",

The flux distribution of these particles implies a\nvery steep size distribution with power-law slopes ranging from -6.6 to -4.7.\nThe radii of the particles extend up to 20 cm, and perhaps up to 2 m, but their\nexact sizes depend on their unknown light scattering properties.

Our objective is to estimate their X-ray peak\nfluxes from EUVI data by finding a relation of the EUVI with GOES X-ray fluxes.\nBecause of the presence of the Fe xxiv line at 192 A, the response of the EUVI\n195 A channel has a secondary broad peak around 15 MK, and its fluxes closely\ntrace X-ray fluxes during the rise phase of flares. If the flare plasma is\nisothermal, the EUVI flux should be directly proportional to the GOES flux. In\nreality, the multithermal nature of the flare and other factors complicate the\nestimation of the X-ray fluxes from EUVI observations. We discuss the uncer-\ntainties, by comparing GOES fluxes with the high cadence EUV data from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). We conclude that the EUVI 195 A data can provide estimates of the X-ray\npeak fluxes of intense flares (e.g., above M4 in the GOES scale) with\nuncertainties of a factor of a few. Lastly we show examples of intense flares\nfrom regions far behind the limb, some of which show eruptive signatures in AIA\nimages.",
