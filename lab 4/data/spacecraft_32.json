    "abstract": "Abstract:  The origin of the slow solar wind is still a topic of much debate. The\ncontinual emergence of small transient structures from helmet streamers is\nthought to constitute one of the main sources of the slow wind. Determining the\nheight at which these transients are released is an important factor in\ndetermining the conditions under which the slow solar wind forms. To this end,\nwe have carried out a multipoint analysis of small transient structures\nreleased from a north-south tilted helmet streamer into the slow solar wind\nover a broad range of position angles during Carrington Rotation 2137.\nCombining the remote-sensing observations taken by the Solar-TErrestrial\nRElations Observatory (STEREO) mission with coronagraphic observations from the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft, we show that the release\nof such small transient structures (often called blobs), which subsequently\nmove away from the Sun, is associated with the concomitant formation of\ntransient structures collapsing back towards the Sun; the latter have been\nreferred to by previous authors as raining inflows. This is the first direct\nassociation between outflowing blobs and raining inflows, which locates the\nformation of blobs above the helmet streamers and gives strong support that the\nblobs are released by magnetic reconnection.",

To find a possible reason for the atypically high proton\noutcome of this event, we study multi-wavelength images and dynamic radio\nspectra and quantitatively reconcile the findings with each other. An\nadditional eruption probably occurred in the same active region about half an\nhour before the main eruption. The latter produced two blast-wave-like shocks\nduring the impulsive phase. The two shock waves eventually merged around the\nradial direction into a single shock traced up to $25R_\\odot$ as a halo ahead\nof the expanding CME body, in agreement with an interplanetary Type II event\nrecorded by the Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation (WAVES) experiment on the\nWind spacecraft. The shape and kinematics of the halo indicate an intermediate\nregime of the shock between the blast wave and bow shock at these distances.\nThe results show that i) the shock wave appeared during the flare rise and\ncould accelerate particles earlier than usually assumed; ii) the particle event\ncould be amplified by the preceding eruption, which stretched closed structures\nabove the developing CME, facilitated its lift-off and escape of\nflare-accelerated particles, enabled a higher CME speed and stronger shock\nahead; iii) escape of flare-accelerated particles could be additionally\nfacilitated by reconnection of the flux rope, where they were trapped, with a\nlarge coronal hole; iv) the first eruption supplied a rich seed population\naccelerated by a trailing shock wave.",

The resulting decrease in planetary radius\nsignificantly alters the interpretation of the exoplanet's bulk composition.\nDespite the faintness of the M4 dwarf host star, our ground-based photometry\nclearly recovers each transit and achieves repeatable 1-sigma precision of\napproximately 0.2 percent (2 millimags). The transit parameters estimated from\nthe DCT data are discrepant with those inferred from the Kepler data to at\nleast 17-sigma confidence. This inconsistency is due to a subtle miscalculation\nof the stellar crowding metric during the Kepler pre-search data conditioning\n(PDC). The crowding metric, or CROWDSAP, is contaminated by a non-existent\n\"phantom star\" originating in the USNO-B1 catalog and inherited by the Kepler\nInput Catalog (KIC). Phantom stars in the KIC are likely rare, but they have\nthe potential to affect statistical studies of Kepler targets that use the PDC\ntransit depths for a large number of exoplanets where individual follow-up\nobservation of each is not possible. The miscalculation of Kepler-445c's\ntransit depth emphasizes the importance of stellar crowding in the Kepler data,\nand provides a cautionary tale for the analysis of data from the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which will have even larger pixels than\nKepler.",

We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer\nheliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause (HP), and in the\nLISM. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between atoms and ions,\nand solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances\nto different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that\ntime-dependent boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric\nasymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure\nof the HP, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is\ndemonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the HP creates\nconsecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are\nmagnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation\nof abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by\nVoyager 1 when it was crossing the HP structure for a period of about one month\nin the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting\nsimulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ\nand remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of\nthe HP is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. We discuss the\ntransport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath,\nconcentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the\npitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the\nlatter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous\nand galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.",

Among\nthose, three icy patches have been selected, and VIRTIS data are used to\nanalyse their properties and their temporal evolution while the comet was\nmoving towards the Sun. We performed an extensive analysis of the spectral\nparameters, and we applied the Hapke radiative transfer model to retrieve the\nabundance and grain size of water ice, as well as the mixing modalities of\nwater ice and dark terrains on the three selected water ice rich areas. Study\nof the spatial distribution of the spectral parameters within the ice-rich\npatches has revealed that water ice follows different patterns associated to a\nbimodal distribution of the grains: ~50 {\\mu}m sized and ~2000 {\\mu}m sized. In\nall three cases, after the first detections at about 3.5 AU heliocentric\ndistance, the spatial extension and intensity of the water ice spectral\nfeatures increased, it reached a maximum after 60-100 days at about 3.0 AU, and\nwas followed by an approximately equally timed decrease and disappearanceat\nabout ~2.2 AU, before perihelion. The behaviour of the analysed patches can be\nassimilated to a seasonal cycle. In addition we found evidence of short-term\nvariability associated to a diurnal water cycle. The similar lifecycle of the\nthree icy regions indicates that water ice is uniformly distributed in the\nsubsurface layers, and no large water ice reservoirs are present.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For the past 17 years, both XMM-Newton and Chandra have brought the powerful\ncombination of high spatial and spectral resolution to the study of black hole\nsystems. Each of these attributes requires special consideration--- in\ncomparison to lower spatial resolution, CCD quality spectra--- when modeling\nobservations obtained by these spacecraft. A good understanding of the high\nresolution spectra is in fact required to model properly lower resolution CCD\nspectra, with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) instrument on\nXMM-Newton maintaining the highest \"figure of merit\" at soft X-ray energies for\nall missions flying or currently planned for the next decade. Thanks to its\neven higher spectral resolution, the use of Chandra-High Energy Transmission\nGratings (HETG), albeit with longer integration times, allows for one to bring\nfurther clarity to RGS studies. A further promising route for continued studies\nis the combination of high spectral resolution at soft X-rays, via RGS and/or\nHETG, with contemporaneous broadband coverage extending to hard X-rays (e.g.,\nNuSTAR or INTEGRAL spectra). Such studies offer special promise for answering\nfundamental questions about accretion in black hole systems; however, they have\nreceived only moderate consideration to date. This may be due in part to the\ndifficulty of analyzing high resolution spectra. In response, we must continue\nto develop software tools that make the analysis of high resolution X-ray\nspectra more accessible to the wider astrophysics community.",

We found that the temporal behaviour\nof SEP ratios is ordered by the value of $S$: ratios with $S>1$ showed\ndecreases over time (i.e.~$B<0$) and those with $S<1$ showed increases ($B>0$).\nWe plotted $B$ as a function of $S$ and observed a clear monotonic dependence:\nratios with a large $S$ decayed at a higher rate.

However, there is a wide range in the gradients of lines\nconnecting binary pairs in a period-color diagram.

In addition, there\nis an apparent gap at intermediate periods in the period distribution of the\nlate K and early M stars. Either star formation in this direction has been\nvariable, or stars evolve in period at a non-uniform rate, or some stars evolve\nmore rapidly than others at the same mass. Finally, using the autocorrelation\nfunction as a measure of the activity level, I found that while the F, G and\nearly K stars become less active as their periods increase, there is no\ncorrelation between period and activity for the mid K to early M stars.",

Some order of magnitude estimations\nhave been performed in recent years to dismiss many possible conventional\neffects as the source of such an anomaly but no explanation has been found yet.\nIn this paper we perform a study of the perturbation induced by ocean tides in\na flybying spacecraft by considering the time dependence of the location of the\nhigh tide as the Moon follows its orbit. We show that this effect implies a\nchange of the spacecraft velocity of a few micrometers per second.\nWe also consider the coupling of tesseral harmonics inhomogeneities and the\nrotation of the Earth and its impact of the spacecraft outgoing velocity.\nSignificant corrections to the observed asymptotic velocities are found in this\ncase but neither their sign nor their magnitude coincide with the anomalies.\nSo, we can also rule this out as a conventional explanation.",

The Langmuir waves are\nobserved via in-situ electric field measurements. These Langmuir waves are not\nsmoothly distributed but occur in discrete clumps, commonly attributed to the\nturbulent nature of the solar wind electron density. Exactly how the density\nturbulence modulates the Langmuir wave electric fields is understood only\nqualitatively. Using weak turbulence simulations, we investigate how solar wind\ndensity turbulence changes the probability distribution functions, mean value\nand variance of the beam-driven electric field distributions. Simulations show\nrather complicated forms of the distribution that are dependent upon how the\nelectric fields are sampled. Generally the higher magnitude of density\nfluctuations reduce the mean and increase the variance of the distribution in a\nconsistent manor to the predictions from resonance broadening by density\nfluctuations. We also demonstrate how the properties of the electric field\ndistribution should vary radially from the Sun to the Earth and provide a\nnumerical prediction for the in-situ measurements of the upcoming Solar Orbiter\nand Solar Probe Plus spacecraft.",

This rather surprising event, occurring at\nan unexpected latitude and time, is the sixth \"Great White Spot\" (GWS) storm\nobserved over the last century and a half. Such GWS events are planetary-scale\natmospheric phenomena that dramatically change the typically bland appearance\nof the planet. Occurring while the Cassini mission was on-orbit at Saturn, the\nGreat Storm of 2010-2011 was well-suited for intense scrutiny by the suite of\nsophisticated instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft as well by modern\ninstrumentation on ground-based telescopes and onboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope. This GWS erupted on December 5th and generated a major dynamical\ndisturbance that affected the whole latitude band from 25 deg to 48 deg N.\nLightning events were prominent and detected as outbursts and flashes at both\noptical and radio wavelengths. The activity of the head ceased after about\nseven months, leaving the cloud structure and ambient winds perturbed. The tops\nof the optically dense clouds of the storm's head reached the 300 mbar altitude\nlevel where a mixture of ices was detected. The energetics of the frequency and\npower of lightning, as well as the estimated power generated by the latent heat\nreleased in the water-based convection, both indicate that the power released\nfor the storm was a significant fraction of Saturn's total radiated power. The\neffects of the storm propagated into the stratosphere forming two warm\nairmasses at the 0.5-5 mbar pressure level altitude. Related to the\nstratospheric disturbance, hydrocarbon composition excesses were found. The\ndecades-long interval between storms is probably related to the insolation\ncycle and the long radiative time constant of Saturn's atmosphere, and several\ntheories for temporarily storing energy have been proposed.",

Once again, Phaethon brightened by\n$\\sim$2 mag soon after its perihelion passage, contradicting expectations from\nthe phase function of a macroscopic monolithic body. Subsequently, a short\nantisolar tail of $\\sim$0\u00b0.1 in length was formed within $\\sim$1 day and\nquickly disappeared. No trail was seen. Our syndyne-synchrone analysis\nindicates that the tail was comprised of submicron to micron particles and can\nbe approximated by a synchrone coinciding with the outburst. We estimate that\nthe outburst has released a mass of $\\sim$10$^{4}$--10$^{5}$ kg, comparable to\nthe two mass ejections in 2009 and 2012, and that the average mass-loss rate is\n$\\sim$0.1--1 kg s$^{-1}$. The forward-scattering effect hinted at low level\nactivity of Phaethon prior to the outburst, which increased the effective cross\nsection by merely $\\lesssim$1 km$^2$. Without the forward-scattering\nenhancement, detecting such activity at side-scattering phase angles is very\ndifficult. The forward-scattering effect also reinforces that the ejected dust\ngrains rather than gas emissions were responsible for the activity of Phaethon.\nDespite Phaethon's reactivation, it is highly unlikely that the Geminid\nmeteoroid stream can be sustained by similar perihelion mass-loss events.",

We review and summarize the present status of\nsolar-system tests of relativistic gravity. With planetary laser ranging,\nspacecraft laser ranging and interferometric laser ranging (laser Doppler\nranging) together with the development of drag-free technology, the optical\nobservations will improve the accuracies by another 3-4 orders of magnitude in\nboth the equivalence principle tests and solar-system dynamics tests of\nrelativistic gravity.

The spacecraft will arrive at the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu in\n2018 where it will perform a survey, land and obtain surface material, then\ndepart in Dec 2019 and return to Earth in Dec 2020. We observed Ryugu with the\nHerschel Space Observatory in Apr 2012 at far-IR thermal wavelengths, supported\nby several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. We\nreanalysed previously published Subaru-COMICS and AKARI-IRC observations and\nmerged them with a Spitzer-IRS data set. In addition, we used a large set of\nSpitzer-IRAC observations obtained in the period Jan to May, 2013. The data set\nincludes two complete rotational lightcurves and a series of ten\n\"point-and-shoot\" observations. The almost spherical shape of the target\ntogether with the insufficient lightcurve quality forced us to combine\nradiometric and lightcurve inversion techniques in different ways to find the\nobject's key physical and thermal parameters. We find that the solution which\nbest matches our data sets leads to this C class asteroid having a retrograde\nrotation with a spin-axis orientation of (lambda = 310-340 deg; beta = -40+/-15\ndeg) in ecliptic coordinates, an effective diameter (of an equal-volume sphere)\nof 850 to 880 m, a geometric albedo of 0.044 to 0.050 and a thermal inertia in\nthe range 150 to 300 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. Based on estimated thermal conductivities of\nthe top-layer surface in the range 0.1 to 0.6 WK-1m-1, we calculated that the\ngrain sizes are approximately equal to between 1 and 10 mm. The finely\nconstrained values for this asteroid serve as a `design reference model', which\nis currently used for various planning, operational and modelling purposes by\nthe Hayabusa2 team.",

Additional theories have been proposed over the years to explain\nobservations that did not fit with the originally proposed fast-mode wave\ninterpretation. However, the incompatibility of observations made using the\nExtreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory with the fast-mode wave interpretation was challenged by differing\nviewpoints from the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft and\nhigher spatial/temporal resolution data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. In\nthis article, we reexamine the theories proposed to explain \"EIT waves\" to\nidentify measurable properties and behaviours that can be compared to current\nand future observations. Most of us conclude that \"EIT waves\" are best\ndescribed as fast-mode large-amplitude waves/shocks that are initially driven\nby the impulsive expansion of an erupting coronal mass ejection in the low\ncorona.",

In addition, the stereoscopic observation by AIA and EUVI\nsuggests that plasma blobs had a three-dimensionally elongated structure. We\nconsider that the plasma blobs were three-dimensional plasmoids (i.e. flux\nropes) moving in a current sheet.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In a two-week period between February and March of 2015, a series of\ninterplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and (solar energetic particles)\nSEPs made contact with Mars. The interactions were observed by several\nspacecraft, including Mars Express (MEX), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile\nEvolution Mission (MAVEN), and Mars Odyssey (MO). The ICME disturbances were\ncharacterized by an increase in ion speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field\nmagnitude, and energetic electron flux. Furthermore, increased solar wind\ndensity and speeds, unusually high local electron densities and high flow\nvelocities were detected on the nightside at high altitudes during the March\n8th event. These effects are thought to be due to the transport of ionospheric\nplasma away from Mars. The peak electron density at periapsis shows a\nsubstantial increase, reaching number densities about 2.7 x 104 cm-3 during the\nsecond ICME in the deep nightside, which corresponds to an increase in the\nMOHigh-Energy Neutron Detector flux, suggesting an increase in the ionization\nof the neutral atmosphere due to the high intensity of charged particles. SEPs\nshow a substantial enhancement before the shock of fourth ICME causing impact\nionization and absorption of the surface echo intensity which drops to the\nnoise levels. Moreover, the peak ionospheric density exhibits a discrete\nenhancement over a period of about 30 hrs around the same location, which maybe\ndue to impact ionization. Ion escape rates at this time are calculated to be in\nthe order of 1025 - 1026 s-1, consistent with MAVEN results, but somewhat\nhigher.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  There is a curious absence of legal constraints on U.S. government agencies\nundertaking potentially risky scientific research. Some of these activities may\npresent a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law\nleaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall\nwithin the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and\nunder what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such\nnon-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only\ninteresting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of\nagency competence and the role of the courts.\nTwo case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium\npower supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers\nin the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy\nparticle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider)\nthat allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a \"killer\nstrangelet\"). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights\nfrom neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and\ncognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in\nlow-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of\njudging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges\nworking in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns\nsuggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to\nlegal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency\nactions that are non-regulatory in nature.",

If such a nanocraft could be accelerated to 20 percent of light\nspeed, it could reach the vicinity of our nearest potentially habitable\nexoplanet within our life time and capture its images and obtain other\nscientific data. In this project the nanocraft is a gram-scale robotic\nspacecraft comprising two main parts: StarChip and Lightsail.\nTo achieve the goal of the project it is necessary to solve a number of\noutstanding scientific problems. One of these tasks is to make sure that the\nnanocraft position and orientation inside the intense laser beam column is\nstable. The nanocraft driven by intense laser beam pressure acting on its\nLightsail is sensitive to the torques and lateral forces reacting on the\nsurface of the sail. These forces influence the orientation and lateral\ndisplacement of the spacecraft, thus affecting its dynamics. If unstable the\nnanocraft might be expelled from the area of laser beam. In choosing the models\nfor nanocraft stability studies we are using several assumptions: 1.\nconfiguration of nanocraft is treated as rigid body (applicability of Euler\nequations); 2. flat or concave shape of circular sail; 3. mirror reflection of\nlaser beam from surface of the Lightsail. We found conditions of position\nstability for spherical and conical shape of the sail. The simplest stable\nconfigurations require the StarChip to be removed from the sail to make the\ndistance to the center of mass of nanocraft bigger than curvature radius of the\nsail. Stability criteria do not require the spinning of the nanocraft. A flat\nsail is never stable (even with spinning).",

Predicting the strength and duration of Bz inside a CME with sufficient\naccuracy is currently impossible, which forms the so-called Bz problem. Here,\nwe provide a proof-of-concept of a new method for predicting the CME arrival\ntime, speed, Bz and the resulting Dst index at Earth based only on magnetic\nfield data, measured in situ in the inner heliosphere (< 1AU). On 2012 June\n12-16, three approximately Earthward-directed and interacting CMEs were\nobserved the by the STEREO imagers, and by Venus Express (VEX) in situ at 0.72\nAU, 6 degree away from the Sun Earth line. The CME kinematics are calculated\nusing the drag-based and WSA-Enlil models, constrained by the arrival time at\nVEX, resulting in the CME arrival time and speed at Earth. The CME magnetic\nfield strength is scaled with a power law from VEX to Wind. Our investigation\nshows promising results for the Dst forecast (predicted: -96 and -114 nT (from\n2 Dst models), observed: -71 nT), for the arrival speed (predicted: 531 +- 23\nkm s-1, observed: 488 +- 30 km s-1) and timing (6 +- 1 hours after actual\narrival time). The prediction lead time is 21 hours.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A large data set of 78 solar proton events observed near the Earth's orbit\nduring 1996-2011 is investigated. An East-West longitudinal (azimuthal)\nasymmetry is found to exist in the distribution of flare sources of solar\nproton events. With the same longitudinal separation between the flare sources\nand the magnetic field line footpoint of observer, the number of the solar\nproton events originating from solar sources located on the eastern side of the\nnominal magnetic footpoint of observer is larger than the number of the solar\nproton events from solar sources located on the western side. We emphasize the\nimportance of this statistical investigation in two aspects. On the one hand,\nthis statistical finding confirms our previous simulation results obtained by\nnumerically solving five-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation of solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) transport. On the other hand, the East-West longitudinally\n(azimuthally) asymmetric distribution of solar proton events accumulated over a\nlong time period provides an observational evidence for the effects of\nperpendicular diffusion on the SEP propagation in the heliosphere. We further\npoint out that, in the sense of perpendicular diffusion, our numerical\nsimulations and statistical results of SEP events confirm each other. We\ndiscuss in detail the important effects of perpendicular diffusion on the\nformation of the East-West azimuthal (longitudinal) asymmetry of SEP\ndistribution in two physical scenarios, i.e., 'multiple SEP events with one\nspacecraft' and 'one SEP event with multiple spacecraft'. A functional relation\nI_{max}(r)=kr^{-1.7} quantifying the radial dependence of SEP peak intensities\nis obtained and utilized in the analysis of physical mechanism. The\nrelationship between our results and those of Dresing et al. is also discussed.",

We analyze spectropolarimetric data of the He\nI 10830 \u00c5 triplet ($1s2s{\\ }^{3}S_{1} - 1s2p{\\ }^{3}P_{2,1,0}$) obtained at\nthe Dunn Solar Telescope with the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter on 19\nSeptember 2011. Cool coronal loops are identified by their prominent drainage\nsignatures in the He I data (redshifts up to 185 km sec$^{-1}$). Extinction of\nEUV background radiation along these loops is observed by both the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager onboard spacecraft A of the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory, and is used to stereoscopically triangulate the loop geometry up\nto heights of 70 Mm ($0.1$ $R_{sun}$) above the solar surface. The He I\npolarized spectra along this loop exhibit signatures indicative of atomic-level\npolarization as well as magnetic signatures through the Hanle and Zeeman\neffects. Spectropolarimetric inversions indicate that the magnetic field is\ngenerally oriented along the coronal loop axis, and provide the height\ndependence of the magnetic field intensity. The technique we demonstrate is a\npowerful one that may help better understand the thermodynamics of coronal fine\nstructure magnetism.",

In this paper we study the\npropagation through interplanetary space of SEP Fe ions, injected near the Sun\nwith a variety of charge states that are uniformly distributed in energy, by\nmeans of a 3D test particle model. In our simulations, due to gradient and\ncurvature drifts associated with the Parker spiral magnetic field, ions of\ndifferent charge propagate with very different efficiencies to an observer that\nis not magnetically well connected to the source region. As a result we find\nthat, for many observer locations, the 1 AU event-averaged charge state <Q>, as\nobtained from our model, displays an increase with particle energy E, in\nqualitative agreement with spacecraft observations. We conclude that\ndrift-associated propagation is a possible explanation for the observed\ndistribution of <Q> versus E in SEP events, and that the distribution measured\nin interplanetary space cannot be taken to represent that at injection.",

Because of its relevance for astrophysical and\nspace plasmas, we explore the excitation of turbulence in current sheets prone\nto component- or guide-field reconnection, a process not well understood, yet.\nWe analyze the anomalous transport properties by using 2.5D Particle-in-Cell\n(PiC) code simulations. We split off the mean, slow variation (in contrast to\nthe fast turbulent fluctuations) of the macroscopic observables and determine\nthe main transport terms of the generalized Ohm's law. We verify our findings\nby comparing with the independently determined slowing-down rate of the\nmacroscopic currents and with the transport terms obtained by the first order\ncorrelations of the turbulent fluctuations. We find that the turbulence is most\nintense in the \"low density\" separatrix region of guide-field reconnection. It\nis excited by streaming instabilities, it is mainly electrostatic, \"patchy\" in\nspace and so is the associated quasi-periodic anomalous transport. The\nremaining irreversible anomalous resistivity can be parametrized by an\neffective collision frequency ranging from the local ion-cyclotron to the\nlower-hybrid frequency. The contributions to the parallel and the perpendicular\n(to the magnetic field) components of the slowly varying, DC-electric fields,\nbalanced by the turbulence, are similar. This anomalous electric field is,\nhowever, smaller than the contributions of the off-diagonal pressure and\nelectron inertia terms of the Ohm's law. This result can now be verified by\nin-situ measurements of the turbulence, in and around the magnetic reconnection\nregions of the Earth's magnetosphere by the multi-spacecraft mission MMS and in\nlaboratory experiments like MRX and VINETA-II.",

In this\narticle, we derive the above-mentioned Hamiltonian from the Dirac equation in a\ncurved spacetime.

We extend the\nobtained Hamiltonian to the case of a spacecraft, containing a macroscopic\nensemble of the atoms and moving with a constant velocity in the Earth's\ngravitational field. On this basis, we discuss some idealized and realistic\nexperiments on the Earth's orbit.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a design for a near-ultraviolet (NUV) imaging instrument which may\nbe flown on a range of available platforms, including high-altitude balloons,\nnanosatellites, or space missions. Although all current UV space missions adopt\na Ritchey-Chretain telescope design, this requires aspheric optics, making the\noptical system complex, expensive and challenging for manufacturing and\nalignment. An all-spherical configuration is a cost-effective and simple\nsolution. We have aimed for a small payload which may be launched by different\nplatforms and we have designed a compact, light-weight payload which will\nwithstand all launch loads. No other UV payloads have been previously reported\nwith an all-spherical optical design for imaging in the NUV domain and a weight\nbelow 2 kg. Our main science goal is focussed on bright UV sources not\naccessible by the more sensitive large space UV missions.\nHere we discuss various aspects of design and development of the complete\ninstrument, the structural and finite-element analysis of the system performed\nto ensure that the payload withstands launch-load stresses and vibrations. We\nexpect to fly this telescope -- Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager (LUCI) -- on a\nspacecraft to the Moon as part of the Indian entry into Google X-Prize\ncompetition. Observations from the Moon provide a unique opportunity to observe\nthe sky from a stable platform far above the Earth's atmosphere. However, we\nwill explore other opportunities as well, and will fly this telescope on a\nhigh-altitude balloon later this year.",

Detection of CMEs is done in time-height\nmaps based on the application of the Hough transform, using a modified version\nof the CACTus software package, conventionally applied to coronagraph data. In\nthis paper we describe the method of detection. We present the result of the\napplication of the technique to a few CMEs that are well detected in the HI-1\nimagery, and compare these results with those based on manual cataloging\nmethodologies.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We investigate the vertical gradient of the magnetic field of sunspots in the\nphotospheric layer. Independent observations were obtained with the SOT/SP\nonboard the Hinode spacecraft and with the TIP-2 mounted at the VTT. We apply\nstate-of-the-art inversion techniques to both data sets to retrieve the\nmagnetic field and the corresponding vertical gradient. In the sunspot\npenumbrae we detected patches of negative vertical gradients of the magnetic\nfield strength, i.e.,the magnetic field strength decreases with optical depth\nin the photosphere. The negative gradient patches are located in the inner and\npartly in the middle penumbrae in both data sets. From the SOT/SP observations,\nwe found that the negative gradient patches are restricted mainly to the deep\nphotospheric layers and are concentrated near the edges of the penumbral\nfilaments. MHD simulations also show negative gradients in the inner penumbrae,\nalso at the locations of filaments. Both in the observations and simulation\nnegative gradients of the magnetic field vs. optical depth dominate at some\nradial distances in the penumbra. The negative gradient with respect to optical\ndepth in the inner penumbrae persists even after averaging in the azimuthal\ndirection, both in the observations and, to a lesser extent, also in MHD\nsimulations. We interpret the observed localized presence of the negative\nvertical gradient of the magnetic field strength in the observations as a\nconsequence of stronger field from spines expanding with height and closing\nabove the weaker field inter-spines. The presence of the negative gradients\nwith respect to optical depth after azimuthal averaging can be explained by two\ndifferent mechanisms: the high corrugation of equal optical depth surfaces and\nthe cancellation of polarized signal due to the presence of unresolved opposite\npolarity patches in the deeper layers of the penumbra.",

This database contains\napproximately 130 terabytes of data describing approximately 1.1 trillion\nsky-projected events with a timestamp resolution of five milliseconds. A\nhandful of Python and command line modules serve as a front-end to interact\nwith the database and to generate calibrated light curves and images from the\nphoton-level data at user-defined temporal and spatial scales. The gPhoton\nsoftware and source code are in active development and publicly available under\na permissive license. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of\nthe calibration pipeline, database, and tools, with emphasis on divergence from\nprior work, as well as challenges created by the large data volume. We\nsummarize the astrometric and photometric performance of gPhoton relative to\nthe original mission pipeline. For a brief example of short time domain science\ncapabilities enabled by gPhoton, we show new flares from the known M dwarf\nflare star CR Draconis.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In large SEP events, ions can be accelerated at CME-driven shocks to very\nhigh energies. Spectra of heavy ions in many large SEP events show features\nsuch as roll-overs or spectral breaks. In some events when the spectra are\nplotted in energy/nucleon they can be shifted relative to each other to make\nthe spectral breaks align. The amount of shift is charge-to-mass ratio (Q/A)\ndependent and varies from event to event. This can be understood if the spectra\nof heavy ions are organized by the diffusion coefficients (Cohen et al., 2005).\nIn the work of Li et al. (2009), the Q/A dependences of the scaling is related\nto shock geometry when the CME-driven shock is close to the Sun. For events\nwhere multiple in-situ spacecraft observations exist, one may expect that\ndifferent spacecraft are connected to different portions of the CME-driven\nshock that have different shock geometries, therefore yielding different Q/A\ndependence. In this work, we examine one SEP event which occurred on 2013\nNovember 4. We study the Q/A dependence of the energy scaling for heavy ion\nspectra using Helium, oxygen, and iron ions. Observations from STEREO-A,\nSTEREO-B and ACE are examined. We find that the scalings are different for\ndifferent spacecraft. We suggest that this is because ACE, STEREO-A and STEREO-\nB are connected to different parts of the shock that have different shock\ngeometries. Our analysis indicates that studying the Q/A scaling of in-situ\nparticle spectra can serve as a powerful tool to remotely examine the shock\ngeometry for large SEP events.",

The orbital altitude was\nheld equal to the asteroid radius for 4.5 months. Both the asteroid gamma-ray\nspectrum and the spacecraft background flux were calculated using the MCNPX\nMonte-Carlo code. GRS is sensitive to depths below the optical surface (to\n~20--50 cm depth depending on material density). This technique can therefore\nmeasure underlying compositions beneath a sulfur-depleted (e.g., Nittler et al.\n2001) or desiccated surface layer. We find that 3\\sigma\\ uncertainties of under\n1 wt% are achievable for H, C, O, Si, S, Fe, and Cl for five carbonaceous\nmeteorite compositions using the heritage Mars Odyssey GRS design in a\nspacecraft- deck-mounted configuration at the Odyssey end-of-mission energy\nresolution, FWHM = 5.7 keV at 1332 keV. The calculated compositional\nuncertainties are smaller than the compositional differences between\ncarbonaceous chondrite subclasses.",

Here we present observations of the Chameleon I cluster whose\nlow declination makes it observable by the Spitzer space telescope over a 200\nday period. We observe 30 young stellar objects with a daily cadence to better\nsample variability on timescales of months. We find such variability is common,\noccurring in ~80% of the detected cluster members. The change in [3.6]-[4.5]\ncolor over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for\nextinction and fluctuations in disk emission. With our high cadence and long\nbaseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of\nmagnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies, up to the\nboundaries of our 200 day survey. Such long timescales are difficult to explain\nwith variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic\nfield, which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks. The most likely\nexplanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout\nthe inner ~0.5 au of the disk, suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is\nhighly dynamic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Small satellite systems enable whole new class of missions for navigation,\ncommunications, remote sensing and scientific research for both civilian and\nmilitary purposes. As individual spacecraft are limited by the size, mass and\npower constraints, mass-produced small satellites in large constellations or\nclusters could be useful in many science missions such as gravity mapping,\ntracking of forest fires, finding water resources, etc. Constellation of\nsatellites provide improved spatial and temporal resolution of the target.\nSmall satellite constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing\na single asset with several very capable spacecraft which opens the door to new\napplications. With increasing levels of autonomy, there will be a need for\nremote communication networks to enable communication between spacecraft. These\nspace based networks will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage\nintermediate nodes, and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives.\nHence, inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in\nformation. In this paper, we present the various researches being conducted in\nthe small satellite community for implementing inter-satellite communications\nbased on the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. This paper also reviews\nthe various design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI\nmodel, i.e., physical, data link and network layer. Based on the survey, we\nalso present a comprehensive list of design parameters useful for achieving\ninter-satellite communications for multiple small satellite missions. Specific\ntopics include proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small\nsatellite systems, enabling operations using a network of small satellites, and\nsome examples of small satellite missions involving formation flying aspects.",
