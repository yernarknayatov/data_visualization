While previous studies have established a strong\ncorrelation between $A_\\mathrm{He}$ and SSN, we show that the phase delay\nbetween $A_\\mathrm{He}$ and SSN is a monotonic increasing function of\n$v_\\mathrm{SW}$. Correcting for this lag, $A_\\mathrm{He}$ returns to the same\nvalue at a given SSN over all rising and falling phases and across solar wind\nspeeds. We infer that this speed-dependent lag is a consequence of the\nmechanism that depletes slow wind $A_\\mathrm{He}$ from its fast wind value\nduring solar wind formation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The nature of solar wind turbulence at large scale is rather well understood\nin the theoretical framework of magnetohydrodynamics. The situation is quite\ndifferent at sub-proton scales where the magnetic energy spectrum measured by\ndifferent spacecrafts does not fit with the classical turbulence predictions: a\npower law index close to $-8/3$ is generally reported which is far from the\npredictions of strong and wave turbulence, $-7/3$ and $-5/2$ respectively. This\ndiscrepancy is considered as a major problem for solar wind turbulence. Here,\nwe show with a nonlinear diffusion model of weak kinetic Alfv\u00e9n wave\nturbulence where the cascade is driven by local triadic interactions (Passot\nand Sulem, 2019), that a magnetic spectrum with a power law index of $-8/3$ can\nemerge. This scaling corresponds to a self-similar solution of the second kind\nwith a front propagation following the law $k_f \\sim (t_*-t)^{-3/4}$, with\n$t<t_*$. This solution appears when we relax the implicit assumption of\nstationarity generally made in turbulence. The agreement between the theory and\nobservations can be interpreted as an evidence of the non-stationarity of solar\nwind turbulence at sub-proton scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In 1984, three telescopes in South America recorded an occultation of a star\nnear Neptune. It was attributed to the existence of a partial ring or ring arc.\nThe existence of ring arcs around Neptune was confirmed during subsequent years\nvia other occultation experiments and by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. The Voyager\nobservations established that the Neptunian arcs are concentrations of\nparticles embedded within Neptune's narrow Adams ring, the outermost of six\ntenuous rings discovered by Voyager and discussed here. Four ring arcs were\nidentified: the trailing arc Fraternit\u00e9, a double-component arc Egalit\u00e9,\ndubbed Egalit\u00e9 1 and 2, Libert\u00e9, and the leading arc Courage. The arcs\nvaried in extent from $\\sim$ 1$^\\circ$ to $\\sim$ 10$^\\circ$, and together were\nconfined to a longitude range of 40$^\\circ$, with typical radial widths of\n$\\sim$ 15 km and optical depth of order 0.1. The properties of the dusty\ncomponent of Neptune's rings are also discussed in this chapter. Although the\narcs should have been destroyed in a few months time through differential\nKeplerian motion, they appeared to persist at least throughout the Voyager era,\nand well beyond. However, observations from Earth (both with the Hubble Space\nTelescope and ground-based adaptive optics) show an evolution in the last three\ndecades, with the disappearance of both Courage and Libert\u00e9 by 2009. This\nchapter reviews the constraints provided on the mean motion of the arcs and\nGalatea, the satellite possibly responsible for the arc confinement. This in\nturn constrains the various models that have been proposed to explain the arc\nlongevity.",

Here we present the\nsecond catalog of LAT-detected GRBs, covering the first 10 years of operations,\nfrom 2008 August 4 to 2018 August 4. A total of 186 GRBs are found; of these,\n91 show emission in the range $30-100\\,$MeV (17 of which are seen only in this\nband) and 169 are detected above 100 MeV. Most of these sources were discovered\nby other instruments ($Fermi$/GBM, $Swift$/BAT, AGILE, INTEGRAL) or reported by\nthe Interplanetary Network (IPN); the LAT has independently triggered on 4\nGRBs. This catalog presents the results for all 186 GRBs. We study onset,\nduration and temporal properties of each GRB, as well as spectral\ncharacteristics in the $100\\,$MeV$-100\\,$GeV energy range. Particular attention\nis given to the photons with highest energy. Compared with the first LAT GRB\ncatalog, our rate of detection is significantly improved. The results generally\nconfirm the main findings of the first catalog: the LAT primarily detects the\nbrightest GBM bursts, and the high-energy emission shows delayed onset as well\nas longer duration. However, in this work we find delays exceeding 1 ks, and\nseveral GRBs with durations over 10 ks. Furthermore, the larger number of LAT\ndetections shows that these GRBs cover not only the high-fluence range of\nGBM-detected GRBs, but also samples lower fluences. In addition, the greater\nnumber of detected GRBs with redshift estimates allows us to study their\nproperties in both the observer and rest frames. Comparison of the\nobservational results with theoretical predictions reveals that no model is\ncurrently able to explain all results, highlighting the role of LAT\nobservations in driving theoretical models.",

Ground-based imagery offers\na convenient data source for satellite characterization; however, analysis\nalgorithms must contend with atmospheric distortion, variable lighting, and\nunknown reflectance properties. Traditional feature-based pose estimation\napproaches are unable to discover an accurate correlation between a known 3D\nmodel and imagery given this challenging image environment. This paper presents\nan innovative method for automated 3D pose estimation of known space objects in\nthe absence of satisfactory texture. The proposed approach fits the silhouette\nof a known satellite model to ground-based imagery via particle filtering. Each\nparticle contains enough information (orientation, position, scale, model\narticulation) to generate an accurate object silhouette. The silhouette of\nindividual particles is compared to an observed image. Comparison is done\nprobabilistically by calculating the joint probability that pixels inside the\nsilhouette belong to the foreground distribution and that pixels outside the\nsilhouette belong to the background distribution. Both foreground and\nbackground distributions are computed by observing empty space. The population\nof particles are resampled at each new image observation, with the probability\nof a particle being resampled proportional to how the particle's silhouette\nmatches the observation image. The resampling process maintains multiple pose\nestimates which is beneficial in preventing and escaping local minimums.\nExperiments were conducted on both commercial imagery and on LEO satellite\nimagery.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This work introduces the Spacecraft Pose Network (SPN) for on-board\nestimation of the pose, i.e., the relative position and attitude, of a known\nnon-cooperative spacecraft using monocular vision. In contrast to other\nstate-of-the-art pose estimation approaches for spaceborne applications, the\nSPN method does not require the formulation of hand-engineered features and\nonly requires a single grayscale image to determine the pose of the spacecraft\nrelative to the camera. The SPN method uses a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) with three branches to solve for the pose. The first branch of the CNN\nbootstraps a state-of-the-art object detector to detect a 2D bounding box\naround the target spacecraft. The region inside the bounding box is then used\nby the other two branches of the CNN to determine the attitude by initially\nclassifying the input region into discrete coarse attitude labels before\nregressing to a finer estimate. The SPN method then uses a novel Gauss-Newton\nalgorithm to estimate the position by using the constraints imposed by the\ndetected 2D bounding box and the estimated attitude. The secondary contribution\nof this work is the generation of the Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset\n(SPEED). SPEED consists of synthetic as well as actual camera images of a\nmock-up of the Tango spacecraft from the PRISMA mission. The synthetic images\nare created by fusing OpenGL-based renderings of the spacecraft's 3D model with\nactual images of the Earth captured by the Himawari-8 meteorological satellite.\nThe actual camera images are created using a 7 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm,\nwhich positions and orients a vision-based sensor with respect to a full-scale\nmock-up of the Tango spacecraft. The SPN method, trained only on synthetic\nimages, produces degree-level attitude error and cm-level position errors when\nevaluated on the actual camera images not used during training.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The new data delivered by NASA's Juno spacecraft significantly increase our\nunderstanding of Jupiter's internal dynamics. The gravity data constrain the\ndepth of the zonal flows observed at cloud level and suggest that they slow\ndown considerably at a depth of about $0.96\\,r_J$, where $r_J$ is the mean\nradius at the one bar level. Juno's magnetometer reveals the planet's internal\nmagnetic field. We combine the new zonal flow and magnetic field models with an\nupdated electrical conductivity profile to assess the zonal wind induced dynamo\naction, concentrating on the outer part of Jupiter's molecular hydrogen region\nwhere the conductivity increases very rapidly with depth. Dynamo action remains\nquasi-stationary and can thus reasonably be estimated where the magnetic\nReynolds number remains smaller than one, which is roughly the region above\n$0.96\\,r_J$. We calculate that the locally induced radial magnetic field\nreaches rms values of about $10^{-6}\\,$T in this region and may just be\ndetectable by the Juno mission. Very localized dynamo action and a distinct\npattern that reflects the zonal wind system increases the chance to disentangle\nthis locally induced field from the background field. The estimates of the\nlocally induced currents also allow calculating the zonal flow related Ohmic\nheating and associated entropy production. The respective quantities remain\nbelow new revised predictions for the total dissipative heating and total\nentropy production in Jupiter for any of the explored model combinations. Thus\nneither Ohmic heating nor entropy production offer additional constraints on\nthe depth of the zonal winds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  HERO (Highly Eccentric Relativity Orbiter) is a space-based mission concept\naimed to perform several tests of post-Newtonian gravity around the Earth with\na preferably drag-free spacecraft moving along a highly elliptical path fixed\nin its plane undergoing a relatively fast secular precession. We considered two\npossible scenarios: a fast, 4-hr orbit with high perigee height of\n$1,047\\,\\mathrm{km}$, and a slow, 21-hr path with a low perigee height of\n$642\\,\\mathrm{km}$. HERO may detect, for the first time, the post-Newtonian\norbital effects induced by the mass quadrupole moment $J_2$ of the Earth which\naffects the semimajor axis $a$ via a secular trend of $\\simeq\n4-12\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,yr}^{-1}$, depending on the orbital configuration. Recently,\nthe secular decay of the semimajor axis of the passive satellite LARES was\nmeasured with an error as little as $0.7\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,yr}^{-1}$. Also the\npost-Newtonian spin dipole (Lense-Thirring) and mass monopole (Schwarzschild)\neffects could be tested to a high accuracy depending on the level of\ncompensation of the non-gravitational perturbations. Moreover, the large\neccentricity of the orbit would allow to constrain several long-range modified\nmodels of gravity and to accurately measure the gravitational red-shift as\nwell. Each of the six Keplerian orbital elements could be individually\nmonitored to extract the $GJ_2/c^2$ signature, or they could be suitably\ncombined in order to disentangle the post-Newtonian effect(s) of interest from\nthe competing mismodeled Newtonian secular precessions induced by the zonal\nharmonic multipoles $J_\\ell$ of the geopotential. In the latter case, the\nsystematic uncertainty due to the current formal errors $\\sigma_{J_\\ell}$ of a\nrecent global Earth's gravity field model are better than $1\\%$ for all the\npost-Newtonian effects considered, with a peak of $\\simeq 10^{-7}$ for the\nSchwarzschild-like shifts.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In this letter we propose a practical methodology to interpret future Parker\nSolar Probe (PSP) turbulent time signals even when Taylor's hypothesis is not\nvalid. By extending Kraichnan's sweeping model used in hydrodynamics we derive\nthe Eulerian spacetime correlation function in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nturbulence. It is shown that in MHD, the temporal decorrelation of small-scale\nfluctuations arises from a combination of hydrodynamic sweeping induced by\nlarge-scale fluid velocity $\\delta u_0$ and by the Alfv\u00e9nic propagation along\nthe local magnetic field. The resulting temporal part of the space-time\ncorrelation function is used to determine the wavenumber range $\\Delta\nk_\\perp=[k_{\\rm min},k_{\\rm max}]$ of the turbulent fluctuations that\ncontribute to the power of a given frequency $\\omega$ of the time signal\nmeasured in the spacecraft frame. Our analysis also shows that the shape of\nfrequency power spectrum $P_{sc}(\\omega)$ of the time signal will follow the\nsame power-law of the reduced power spectrum $E(k_\\perp)\\sim k^{-\\alpha}_\\perp$\nin the plasma frame, where $\\alpha$ is the spectral index. The proposed\nframework for the analysis of PSP time signals entirely relies on two simple\ndimensionless parameters that can be empirically obtained from PSP\nmeasurements, namely, $\\epsilon=\\delta u_0/\\sqrt 2 V_\\perp$ (where $V_\\perp$ is\nthe perpendicular velocity of PSP seen in the plasma frame) and the spectral\nindex $\\alpha$.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  An outstanding, multi-disciplinary goal of modern science is the study of the\ndiversity of potentially Earth-like planets and the search for life in them.\nThis goal requires a bold new generation of space telescopes, but even the most\nambitious designs yet hope to characterize several dozen potentially habitable\nplanets. Such a sample may be too small to truly understand the complexity of\nexo-earths. We describe here a notional concept for a novel space observatory\ndesigned to characterize 1,000 transiting exo-earth candidates. The Nautilus\nconcept is based on an array of inflatable spacecraft carrying very large\ndiameter (8.5m), very low-weight, multi-order diffractive optical elements\n(MODE lenses) as light-collecting elements. The mirrors typical to current\nspace telescopes are replaced by MODE lenses with a 10 times lighter areal\ndensity that are 100 times less sensitive to misalignments, enabling\nlight-weight structure. MODE lenses can be cost-effectively replicated through\nmolding. The Nautilus mission concept has a potential to greatly reduce\nfabrication and launch costs, and mission risks compared to the current space\ntelescope paradigm through replicated components and identical, light-weight\nunit telescopes. Nautilus is designed to survey transiting exo-earths for\nbiosignatures up to a distance of 300 pc, enabling a rigorous statistical\nexploration of the frequency and properties of life-bearing planets and the\ndiversity of exo-earths.",

A recently developed paradigm of\nstate-triggered constraints allows to efficiently embed a subset of discrete\ndecision constraints into the continuous optimization framework of successive\nconvexification. As a result, we are able to solve difficult trajectory\noptimization problems at interactive speeds, as opposed to a mixed-integer\nprogramming approach that would require significantly more solution time and\ncomputing power. Our method is applied to the real problem of transposition and\ndocking of the Apollo command and service module with the lunar module. We\ndemonstrate that, within seconds, we are able to obtain trajectories that are\nup to 90 percent more fuel efficient (saving up to 45 kg of fuel) than\nnon-optimization based Apollo-era design targets. Our trajectories take\nexplicit account of minimum thrust pulse width and plume impingement\nconstraints. Both of these constraints are naturally mixed-integer, but we\nhandle them as state-triggered constraints. In its current state, our algorithm\nwill serve as a useful off-line design tool for rapid trajectory trade studies.",

To illustrate the methodology, an\noccultation observation made during flyby T52 is analyzed, when the Cassini\nspacecraft had insufficient attitude control. A high-resolution stellar model\nand an instrument response simulator that includes the position of the point\nsource on the detector are used for the analysis of the pointing motion. The\nMarkov Chain Monte-Carlo method is used to retrieve the line-of-sight abundance\nprofiles of eleven species (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C4H2, C6H6, HCN, C2N2, HC3N,\nC6N2 and haze particles) in the spectral vector fitting process. We obtain\ntight constraints on all of the species aside from C2H6, C2N2 and C6N2, for\nwhich we only retrieved upper limits. This is the first time that the T52\noccultation was used to derive abundances of major hydrocarbon and nitrile\nspecies in Titan's upper and middle atmosphere, as pointing motion prohibited\nprior analysis.

These transverse oscillations are not connected to any external\nphenomena like flares or coronal mass ejections, and show significantly lower\namplitudes than the externally excited decaying oscillations. Numerical studies\nhave managed to reproduce such decayless oscillations in the form of footpoint\ndriven standing waves in coronal loops, and to treat them as a possible\nmechanism for wave heating of the solar corona. Our aim is to investigate the\ncorrelation between the observed amplitudes of the oscillations and input the\nenergy flux from different drivers. We perform 3D MHD simulations in single,\nstraight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes for different drivers, in the\npresence of gravity. Synthetic images at different spectral lines are\nconstructed with the use of the FoMo code. The development of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability leads to mixing of plasma between the flux tube\nand the hot corona. Once the KHI is fully developed, the amplitudes of the\ndecayless oscillations show only a weak correlation with the driver strength.\nWe find that low amplitude decayless kink oscillations may correspond to\nsignificant energy fluxes of the order of the radiative losses for the Quiet\nSun. A clear correlation between the input energy flux and the observed\namplitudes from our synthetic imaging data cannot be established. Stronger\ndrivers lead to higher vales of the line width estimated energy fluxes.\nFinally, estimations of the energy fluxes by spectroscopic data are affected by\nthe LOS angle, favoring combined analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data for\nsingle oscillating loops.",

The telemetry budget of the\nspacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar\nsample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to\nperform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to\nproduce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model\nthat optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered\nthree distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and\nweighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a\nnovel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between\ndifferent mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best\ncompromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We\ndetermined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and\nfrequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the\nbinary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio\ncompared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in\ndetecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious\nsignals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects\nconsiderably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the\nformer to deliver up to $\\sim$30\\% less false transit signatures at\n$7.1\\sigma$.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Little is known about the origin of the high-energy and sustained emission\nfrom solar Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares (LDGRFs), identified with the Compton\nGamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), and now Fermi.\nThough Fermi/Large Area Space Telescope (LAT) has identified dozens of flares\nwith LDGRF signature, the nature of this phenomenon has been a challenge to\nexplain both due to the extreme energies and long durations. The highest-energy\nemission has generally been attributed to pion production from the interaction\nof >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter. The extended duration suggests\nthat particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending high in the\ncorona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from\nback precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks. It is possible to\ntest these models by making direct comparison between the properties of the\naccelerated ion population producing the gamma-ray emission derived from the\nFermi/LAT observations, and the characteristics of solar energetic particles\n(SEPs) measured by the Payload for Matter-Antimatter Exploration and Light\nNuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) spacecraft in the energy range corresponding to\nthe pion-related emission detected with Fermi. For fourteen of these events we\ncompare the two populations -- SEPs in space and the interacting particles at\nthe Sun -- and discuss the implications in terms of potential sources. Our\nanalysis shows that the two proton numbers are poorly correlated, with their\nratio spanning more than five orders of magnitude, suggesting that the back\nprecipitation of shock-acceleration particles is unlikely the source of the\nLDGRF emission.",

Aims: Our goal is\nto compare these phase curves with those of tentatively analog dust samples to\nassess the key dust properties that might induce this shape. Methods:\nLight-scattering measurements have been made with the PROGRA2 instrument in the\nlaboratory and in microgravity conditions on samples of different physical\nproperties and compositions that are likely to be representative of cometary\ndust particles. Results: We find that the brightness phase curves of a series\nof interplanetary dust analogs that have been recently developed (to fit the\npolarimetric properties of the inner zodiacal cloud and their changes with\nheliocentric distance) are quite comparable to those of 67P. Key dust\nproperties seem to be related to the composition and the porosity. Conclusions:\nWe conclude that the shape of the brightness phase curves of 67P has to be\nrelated to the presence of a significant amount of organic compounds (at least\n50% in mass) and of fluffy aggregates (of a size range of 10 to 200 microns).\nWe also confirm similarities between the dust particles of this Jupiter-family\ncomet and the particles within the inner zodiacal cloud.",

Between late 2012 and\nmid-2017, three large-scale events occurred, lasting from ~100 to ~630 days.\nOmnidirectional and directional high-energy data from Voyager 1's Cosmic Ray\nSubsystem are used to report cosmic ray intensity variations.

The joints of the gimbal can be actuated. In this\nway, the orientation of axis for the gyro in relation to the egg can be\nchanged.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Today, the near-Earth space is facing a paradigm change as the number of new\nspacecraft is literally sky-rocketing. Increasing numbers of small satellites\nthreaten the sustainable use of space, as without removal, space debris will\neventually make certain critical orbits unusable. A central factor affecting\nsmall spacecraft health and leading to debris is the radiation environment,\nwhich is unpredictable due to an incomplete understanding of the near-Earth\nradiation environment itself and its variability driven by the solar wind and\nouter magnetosphere. This paper presents the FORESAIL-1 nanosatellite mission,\nhaving two scientific and one technological objectives. The first scientific\nobjective is to measure the energy and flux of energetic particle loss to the\natmosphere with a representative energy and pitch angle resolution over a wide\nrange of magnetic local times. To pave the way to novel model - in situ data\ncomparisons, we also show preliminary results on precipitating electron fluxes\nobtained with the new global hybrid-Vlasov simulation Vlasiator. The second\nscientific objective of the FORESAIL-1 mission is to measure energetic neutral\natoms (ENAs) of solar origin. The solar ENA flux has the potential to\ncontribute importantly to the knowledge of solar eruption energy budget\nestimations. The technological objective is to demonstrate a satellite\nde-orbiting technology, and for the first time, make an orbit manoeuvre with a\npropellantless nanosatellite. FORESAIL-1 will demonstrate the potential for\nnanosatellites to make important scientific contributions as well as promote\nthe sustainable utilisation of space by using a cost-efficient de-orbiting\ntechnology.",

Using the arrival time of the radio\nwaves at multiple spacecraft, we are able to determine the trajectory of the\nradio source in the Ecliptic plane, and its outward speed, as well as the\ninjection time and longitude of the associated electron beam near the solar\nsurface that triggers the Type-III radio burst. For the application of this\nmethod, we design a system to gather the arrival time of the radio wave from\nthe radio dynamic spectra observed by Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory\n(STEREO)/WAVES and Wind/WAVES. Then the system forward models the trajectory\nand speed of the radio burst exciter iteratively according to an evaluation\nfunction. Finally, we present a survey of four Type-III radio bursts that are\nwell discussed in the literature. The modeled trajectories of the radio source\nare consistent with the previous radio-triangulation results, the longitude of\nthe associated active region, or the location of Langmuir waves excited by the\nelectron beam.",

We present a statistical\nanalysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler frequency range (above\n16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over three years\naboard ARTEMIS spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30\nhours in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the\ninterpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves. We provide estimates\nof the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes, frequencies and\nbandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly\ndepend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler waves amplitudes\nare in the range from about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the\nbackground magnetic field. The frequencies of the whistler waves are shown to\nbe below an upper bound that is dependent on $\\beta_{e}$. The correlations\nestablished between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma\nparameters suggest that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local\nplasmas by the whistler heat flux instability. The whistler wave amplitudes are\ntypically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel whistler\nwaves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind. We show\nthat the observed whistler waves have sufficiently wide bandwidths and small\namplitudes, so that effects of the whistler waves on electrons can be addressed\nin the frame of the quasi-linear theory.",

ARTEMIS observes quasi-parallel whistler\nwaves in the frequency range $\\sim 0.05 - 0.2 f_{ce}$ simultaneously with\nelectron velocity distribution functions that are a combination of\ncounter-streaming core and halo populations. A linear stability analysis shows\nthat the plasma is stable when there are no whistler waves, and unstable in the\npresence of whistler waves. In the latter case, the stability analysis shows\nthat the whistler wave growth time is from a few to ten seconds at frequencies\nand wavenumbers that match the observations. The observations clearly\ndemonstrate that the temperature anisotropy of halo electrons crucially affects\nthe heat flux instability onset: a slight anisotropy\n$T_{\\parallel}/T_{\\perp}>1$ may quench the instability, while a slight\nanisotropy $T_{\\parallel} / T_{\\perp}<1$ may significantly increase the growth\nrate.

Instead we present a suite of models that assume the planet's\ninterior rotates on cylinders, which allows us to match all the observed even\ngravity harmonics. For every interior model, the gravity field is calculated\nself-consistently with high precision using the Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid\n(CMS) method.

We analyze the magnetic\nfield structures of 18 ICME magnetic flux ropes observed by radially aligned\nspacecraft in the inner heliosphere. Similarity in the underlying flux rope\nstructures is determined through the application of a simple technique that\nmaps the magnetic field profile from one spacecraft to the other.

The mapping technique reveals similarities that are not readily\napparent in the unmapped data and is a useful tool when determining whether\nmagnetic field time series observed at different spacecraft are associated with\nthe same ICME. Lundquist fitting has been applied to the flux ropes and the\nrope orientations have been determined; macroscale differences in the profiles\nat the aligned spacecraft may be ascribed to differences in flux rope\norientation. Assuming that the same region of the ICME was observed by the\naligned spacecraft in each case, the fitting indicates some weak tendency for\nthe rope axes to reduce in inclination relative to the solar equatorial plane\nand to align with the solar east-west direction with heliocentric distance.",

The implementation\nof this network would permit measurement of the solar system's tidal gravity\nfield to high precision, thereby revealing the existence of distant\ntrans-Neptunian objects such as the proposed \"Planet Nine.\" As a detailed\nexample of the network capabilities, we investigate how occultations by Jovian\nTrojans can be monitored to track the accumulation of gravitational\nperturbations, thereby constraining the presence of undetected massive solar\nsystem bodies. We also show that the tidal influence of Planet Nine can be\ndiscerned from that of smaller, nearer objects in the Kuiper belt. Moreover,\nephemerides for all small solar system bodies observed in occultation could be\nsignificantly improved using this network, thereby improving spacecraft\nnavigation and refining Solar System modeling. Finally, occultation monitoring\nwould generate direct measurements of size distributions for asteroid\npopulations, permitting a better understanding of their origins.",

Using statistical\nhomogeneity, we revisit the law proposed by Hellinger et al. (2018) and show\nthat it can be written, after being corrected by a multiplicative factor, in a\nmore compact form implying only flux terms expressed as increments of the\nturbulent fields. The Hall contribution of this law is tested and compared to\nother exact laws derived by Galtier (2008) and Banerjee & Galtier (2017) using\ndirect numerical simulations (DNSs) of three-dimensional electron MHD (EMHD)\nturbulence with a moderate mean magnetic field. We show that the studied laws\nare equivalent in the inertial range, thereby offering several choices on the\nformulation to use depending on the needs. The expressions that depend\nexplicitly on a mean (guide) field may lead to residual errors in estimating\nthe energy cascade rate ; however, we demonstrate that this guide field can be\nremoved from these laws after mathematical manipulation. Therefore, it is\nrecommended to use an expression independent of the mean guide field to analyze\nnumerical or in-situ spacecraft data.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In terms of scientific output, the best way to study solar system bodies is\nsending spacecraft to make in-situ measurements or to observe at close\ndistance. Probably, the second best means to learn about important physical\nproperties of solar system objects is through stellar occultations. By\ncombining occultation observations from several sites, size and shape can be\nderived with kilometric accuracy. Also, atmospheric properties can be derived\nif the body has an atmosphere. Furthermore, the technique can detect rings and\neven satellites (although rarely) around the main body. Except for the very\nspecial cases of Pluto and Charon, stellar occultations by Transneptunian\nObjects (TNOs) had never been observed until October 2009. This was because the\nephemeris of the TNOs have much larger uncertainties than their angular\ndiameters (typically of the order of ~10 milliarcsecond) and also because\nstellar catalogs were not accurate to the milliarcsecond level. Despite the\ndifficulties, at the time of this writing, 43 occultations by 22 different\nTrans-Neptunian Objects, and 17 occultations by 5 Centaurs have been detected\nthanks to the efforts of several teams. Due to the complications of accurately\npredicting and observing these events, most of the successes have been achieved\nthrough wide international collaboration, which is a key issue to succeed in\nobserving stellar occultations by TNOs. Multichord occultations are typically\ndetected at a rate of ~3 per year on average, whereas the majority of the\nobserved occultations are single-chord detections, which means that only one\nsite detects the occultation. In these cases, no tight constraints on size and\nshape can be derived from those observations alone. Here we review most of the\naspects involved in the complex process to successfully observe occultations,\nand present some of the lessons learned.",

The\nexpectation based on similar hydrodynamics scalings, is that the kurtosis, of\nthe small scale magnetic field increments, will increase with increasing\nReynolds number. Simple theoretical arguments as well as Voyager observations\nindicate that effective interplanetary turbulence Reynolds number decreases\nwith increasing heliocentric distance. The decrease of scale-dependent magnetic\nincrement kurtosis with increasing heliocentric distance, is verified using a\nnewly refined Voyager magnetic field dataset. We argue that these scalings\ncontinue to much smaller heliocentric distances approaching the Alfven critical\nregion, motivating a prediction that the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft will\nobserve increased magnetic field intermittency, stronger current sheets, and\nmore localized dissipation, as its perihelion approaches the critical regions.\nSimilar arguments should be applicable to turbulence in other expanding\nastrophysical plasmas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The zodiacal dust complex, a population of dust and small particles that\npervades the Solar System, provides important insight into the formation and\ndynamics of planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies. Here we present a new\nset of data obtained using a novel technique: direct measurements of momentum\ntransfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is\nmade possible by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA\nPathfinder spacecraft, a technology demonstrator for a future space-based\ngravitational wave observatory that operated near the first Sun-Earth Lagrange\npoint from early 2016 through Summer of 2017. Using a simple model of the\nimpacts and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to\ndetect impacts and measure properties such as the transferred momentum (related\nto the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel, and location of\nimpact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic\nsearch for impacts during 4348 hours of Pathfinder data. We report a total of\n54 candidates with momenta ranging from 0.2$\\,\\mu\\textrm{Ns}$ to\n230$\\,\\mu\\textrm{Ns}$. We furthermore make a comparison of these candidates\nwith models of micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system including\nthose resulting from Jupiter-family comets, Oort-cloud comets, Hailey-type\ncomets, and Asteroids. We find that our measured population is consistent with\na population dominated by Jupiter-family comets with some evidence for a\nsmaller contribution from Hailey-type comets. This is in agreement with\nconsensus models of the zodiacal dust complex in the momentum range sampled by\nLISA Pathfinder.",

We develop an automated shock\nfront detection algorithm using the EMF as the main detection criterion and\ncompare the results to an existing CME database. The properties of the EMF\nduring the recorded events are discussed as a function of the heliocentric\ndistance. Our algorithm reproduces most of the the events from Kilpua et al.\n(2015) and finds many additional CME-like events which proves the EMF as a good\nshock front indicator. The largest peaks in the EMF are found from 0 to 50\nminutes after the initial shock.

In this study, we extend the automated detection of\nsmall-scale flux ropes based on the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction to the\ncomplete dataset of \\emph{Ulysses} spacecraft in-situ measurements. We first\ndiscuss the temporal variation of the bulk properties of 22,719 flux ropes\nfound through our approach, namely, the average magnetic field and plasma\nparameters, etc., as functions of the heliographical latitudes and heliocentric\nradial distances. We then categorize all identified events into three groups\nbased on event distributions in different latitudes separated at 30$^{\\circ}$,\nat different radial distances, and under different solar activities,\nrespectively. By the detailed statistical analysis, we conclude as follows. (1)\nThe properties of flux ropes, such as the duration, scale size, etc., follow\nthe power-law distributions, but with different slope indices, especially for\ndistributions at different radial distances. (2) Also, they are affected by the\nsolar wind speed which has different distributions under the different solar\nactivities, which is manifested as the latitudinal effect. (3) The main\ndifference in flux rope properties between the low and high latitudes is\nattributed to possible Alfv\u00e9nic structures or waves. (4) Flux ropes with\nlonger duration and larger scale sizes occur more often at larger radial\ndistances. (5) With more strict Wal\u00e9n slope threshold, more events are\nexcluded at higher latitudes. The entire database is published online at\n\\url{this http URL}.",
