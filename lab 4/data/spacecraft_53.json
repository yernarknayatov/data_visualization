    "abstract": "Abstract:  We describe a new space gravitational wave observatory design called LAGRANGE\nthat maintains all important LISA science at about half the cost and with\nreduced technical risk. It consists of three drag-free spacecraft in the most\nstable geocentric formation, the Earth-Moon L3, L4, and L5 Lagrange points.\nFixed antennas allow continuous contact with the Earth, solving the problem of\ncommunications bandwidth and latency. A 70 mm diameter AuPt sphere with a 35 mm\ngap to its enclosure serves as a single inertial reference per spacecraft,\nwhich is operated in \"true\" drag-free mode (no test mass forcing). This is the\ncore of the Modular Gravitational Reference Sensor whose other advantages are:\na simple caging design based on the DISCOS 1972 drag-free mission, an all\noptical read-out with pm fine and nm coarse sensors, and the extensive\ntechnology heritage from the Honeywell gyroscopes, and the DISCOS and Gravity\nProbe B drag-free sensors. An Interferometric Measurement System, designed with\nreflective optics and a highly stabilized frequency standard, performs the\ninter-test mass ranging and requires a single optical bench with one laser per\nspacecraft. Two 20 cm diameter telescopes per spacecraft, each with in-field\npointing, incorporate novel technology developed for advanced optical systems\nby Lockheed Martin, who also designed the spacecraft based on a multi-flight\nproven bus structure. Additional technological advancements include the\ndrag-free propulsion, thermal control, charge management systems, and\nmaterials. LAGRANGE sub-systems are designed to be scalable and modular, making\nthem interchangeable with those of LISA or other gravitational science\nmissions. We plan to space qualify critical technologies on small and nano\nsatellite flights, with the first launch (UV-LED Sat) in 2013.",

This study made use of analysis carried out by members of a\ndistributed web-based project, Solar Stormwatch. A comparison between\nobservations of the brightest particle trails and a survey of fainter trails\nshows consistent distributions. While there is no obvious correlation between\nthis distribution and the occurrence of individual meteor streams at Earth,\nthere are some broad longitudinal features in these distributions that are also\nobserved in sources of the sporadic meteor population. The asymmetry in the\nnumber of trails seen by each spacecraft and the fact that there are many more\nunexpected off-points in the HI-B than in HI-A, indicates that the majority of\nimpacts are coming from the apex direction. For impacts causing off-points in\nthe HI-B camera these dust particles are estimated to have masses in excess of\n10-17 kg with radii exceeding 0.1 {\\mu}m. For off-points observed in the HI-A\nimages, which can only have been caused by particles travelling from the\nanti-apex direction, the distribution is consistent with that of secondary\n'storm' trails observed by HI-B, providing evidence that these trails also\nresult from impacts with primary particles from an anti-apex source. It is\napparent that the differential mass index of particles from the apex direction\nis consistently above 2. This indicates that the majority of the mass is within\nthe smaller particles of this population. In contrast, the differential mass\nindex of particles from the anti-apex direction (causing off-points in HI-A) is\nconsistently below 2, indicating that the majority of the mass is to be found\nin larger particles of this distribution.",

With its ~100km size, Lutetia is one\nof the largest asteroids ever imaged by a spacecraft. During the flyby, the\non-board OSIRIS imaging system acquired spectacular images of Lutetia's\nnorthern hemisphere revealing a complex surface scarred by numerous impact\ncraters, reaching the maximum dimension of about 55km. In this paper, we assess\nthe cratering history of the asteroid. For this purpose, we apply current\nmodels describing the formation and evolution of main belt asteroids, that\nprovide the rate and velocity distributions of impactors. These models, coupled\nwith appropriate crater scaling laws, allow us to interpret the observed crater\nsize-frequency distribution (SFD) and constrain the cratering history. Thanks\nto this approach, we derive the crater retention age of several regions on\nLutetia, namely the time lapsed since their formation or global surface reset.\nWe also investigate the influence of various factors -like Lutetia's bulk\nstructure and crater obliteration- on the observed crater SFDs and the\nestimated surface ages. From our analysis, it emerges that Lutetia underwent a\ncomplex collisional evolution, involving major local resurfacing events till\nrecent times. The difference in crater density between the youngest and oldest\nrecognized units implies a difference in age of more than a factor of 10. The\nyoungest unit (Beatica) has an estimated age of tens to hundreds of Myr, while\nthe oldest one (Achaia) formed during a period when the bombardment of\nasteroids was more intense than the current one, presumably around 3.6Gyr ago\nor older.",

These\ndata also reveal a localized depletion in particle density near Saturn's\nequatorial plane around Enceladus' semi-major axis. Finally, variations are\ndetected in the radial brightness profile and the vertical thickness of the\nring as a function of longitude relative to the Sun.

The data-sets reveal an Eiffel-tower type jet configuration extending\ninto a narrow jet in the outer corona. The event starts from the growth of a\ndark area in the central part of the structure. The darkening was also observed\nin projection on the disk by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead\n(STEREO-A) spacecraft from a different point of view. We assume that the dark\nvolume in the corona descends from a coronal cavity of a flux rope that moved\nup higher in the corona but still failed to erupt. The quadrupolar magnetic\nconfiguration corresponds to a saddle-like shape of the dark volume and\nprovides a possibility for the plasma to escape along the open field lines into\nthe outer corona, forming the white-light jet.",

Here, we analyze the line-of-sight velocity\npatterns in this active region during the X3.4 flare using the Dopplergrams\nobtained by GONG instrument. We have also analyzed the disk-integrated velocity\nobservations of the Sun obtained by GOLF instrument onboard SOHO spacecraft as\nwell as full-disk collapsed velocity signals from GONG observations during this\nflare to study any possible connection between the flare related changes seen\nin the local and global velocity oscillations in the Sun. We apply wavelet\ntransform to the time series of the localized velocity oscillations as well as\nthe global velocity oscillations in the Sun spanning the flare event. The\nline-of-sight velocity shows significant enhancement in some localized regions\nof the penumbra of this active region during the flare. The affected region is\nseen to be away from the locations of the flare ribbons and the hard X-ray\nfootpoints. The sudden enhancement in this velocity seems to be caused by the\nLorentz force driven by the \"magnetic jerk\" in the localized penumbral region.\nApplication of wavelet analysis to these flare induced localized seismic\nsignals show significant enhancement in the high-frequency domain (5-8 mHz) and\na feeble enhancement in the p-mode oscillations (2-5 mHz) during the flare. On\nthe other hand, the wavelet analysis of GOLF velocity data and the full-disk\ncollapsed GONG velocity data spanning the flare event indicate significant\npost-flare enhancements in the high-frequency global velocity oscillations in\nthe Sun.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  About 10% of upper main sequence stars are characterised by the presence of\nchemical peculiarities, often found together with a structured magnetic field.\nThe atmospheres of most of those chemically peculiar stars present surface\nspots, leading to photometric variability caused by rotational modulation. The\nstudy of the light curves of those stars therefore, permits a precise\nmeasurement of their rotational period, which is important to study stellar\nevolution and to plan further detailed observations. We analysed the light\ncurves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the STEREO spacecraft.\nWe present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiar\nstars in our sample. Thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,\nSTEREO data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with a\nperiodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. Using a matched\nfilter algorithm and then two different period searching algorithms, we\ncompiled a list of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar stars for which we measured\na reliable rotational period; for 48 of them this is the first measurement of\ntheir rotational period. The remaining 255 stars are likely to be constant,\nalthough we cannot exclude the presence of long period variability. In some\ncases, the presence of blending or systematic effects prevented us from\ndetecting any reliable variability and in those cases we classified the star as\nconstant. For each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,\nluminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towards\nthe shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of the\nrotational period. For a few stars, the comparison between their projected\nrotational velocity and equatorial velocity let us believe that their real\nrotational period might be longer than that found here and previously obtained.",

The H-alpha emission of solar flare kernels and associated hard X-ray\n(HXR) emission often show similar time variations but their light curves are\nshifted in time by energy transfer mechanisms. We searched for fast radiative\nresponse of the chromosphere in the H-alpha line as a signature of electron\nbeam heating. Methods. We investigate the time differences with sub-second\nresolution between the H-alpha line emission observed with a Multi-channel\nSubtractive Double Pass (MSDP) spectrograph on the Large Coronagraph and\nHorizontal Telescope at Bialkow Observatory, Poland, and HXR emission recorded\nby the RHESSI spacecraft during several flares, greatly extending our earlier\nanalysis (Paper I) to flares between 2003 and 2005. Results. For 16 H-alpha\nflaring kernels, observed in 12 solar flares, we made 72 measurements of time\ndelays between local maxima of the RHESSI X-ray and H-alpha emissions. For most\nkernels, there is an excellent correlation between time variations in the\nH-alpha line emission (at line centre and in the line wings) and HXR (20-50\nkeV) flux, with the H-alpha emission following features in the HXR light curves\ngenerally by a short time lapse delta t = 1-2 s, sometimes significantly longer\n(10-18 s). We also found a strong spatial correlation. Conclusions. Owing to\nour larger number of time measurements than in previous studies, the\ndistribution of delta t values shows a much clearer pattern, with many examples\nof short (1-2 s) delays of the H-alpha emission, but with some flares showing\nlonger (10-18 s) delays. The former are consistent with energy transfer along\nthe flaring loop legs by non-thermal electron beams, the latter to the passage\nof conduction fronts.",

While\nCeres' visible and near-infrared disk-integrated spectra have been well\ncharacterized, little has been done about quantifying spectral variations over\nthe surface. Any spectral variation would give us insights on the geographical\nvariation of the composition and/or the surface age. The only work so far was\nthat of Rivkin & Volquardsen (2010, Icarus 206, 327) who reported\nrotationally-resolved spectroscopic (disk-integrated) observations in the\n2.2-4.0 {\\mu}m range; their observations showed evidence for a relatively\nuniform surface. Here, we report disk-resolved observations of Ceres with\nSINFONI (ESO VLT) in the 1.17-1.32 {\\mu}m and 1.45-2.35 {\\mu}m wavelength\nranges. The observations were made under excellent seeing conditions (0.6\"),\nallowing us to reach a spatial resolution of ~75 km on Ceres' surface. We do\nnot find any spectral variation above a 3% level, suggesting a homogeneous\nsurface at our spatial resolution. Slight variations (about 2%) of the spectral\nslope are detected, geographically correlated with the albedo markings reported\nfrom the analysis of the HST and Keck disk-resolved images of Ceres (Li et al.,\n2006, Icarus 182, 143; Carry et al., 2008, A&A 478, 235).

We analyze a set\nof 1065 24-hour long intervals (covering full missions). For each interval, we\ncompute the magnetic autocorrelation function, using classical\nsingle-spacecraft techniques, and estimate \\lambda with help of two different\nproxies for both Helios datasets. We find that close to the Sun,\n\\lambda_parallel < \\lambda_perp. This supports a slab-like spectral model,\nwhere the population of fluctuations having wavevector k parallel to B0 is much\nlarger than the one with k-vector perpendicular. A population favoring\nperpendicular k-vectors would be considered quasi-two dimensional (2D). Moving\ntowards 1 AU, we find a progressive isotropization of \\lambda and a trend to\nreach an inverted abundance, consistent with the well-known result at 1 AU that\n\\lambda_parallel > \\lambda_perp, usually interpreted as a dominant quasi-2D\npicture over the slab picture.

We\nfind that these dimmings are synchronized and appear during the impulsive\nacceleration phase of the CME, with the highest EUV intensity drop occurring a\nfew minutes after the maximum CME acceleration. During the propagation phase\ntwo confined, bipolar dimming regions, appearing near the footpoints of a\npre-flare sigmoid structure, show an apparent migration away from the site of\nthe CME-associated flare. Additionally, they rotate around the 'center' of the\nflare site, i.e., the configuration of the dimmings exhibits the same\n'sheared-to-potential' evolution as the postflare loops. We conclude that the\nmotion pattern of the twin dimmings reflects not only the eruption of the flux\nrope, but also the ensuing stretching of the overlying arcade. Finally, we find\nthat: (1) the global-scale dimmings, expanding from the source region of the\neruption, propagate with a speed similar to that of the leaving CME front; (2)\nthe mass loss occurs mainly during the period of strongest CME acceleration.\nTwo hours after the eruption Hinode/EIS observations show no substantial plasma\noutflow, originating from the 'open' field twin dimming regions.",

By treating the CBF as a\nlinear superposition of sinusoidal waves within a Gaussian envelope, the\nresulting dispersion rate of the pulse was found to be ~8-13 Mm^2 s^-1. These\nresults are indicative of a fast-mode magnetoacoustic wave pulse propagating\nthrough an inhomogeneous medium.",

LEMUR consists of two major\ncomponents: a VUV solar telescope with a 30 cm diameter mirror and a focal\nlength of 3.6 m, and a focal-plane package composed of VUV spectrometers\ncovering six carefully chosen wavelength ranges between 17 and 127 nm. The\nLEMUR slit covers 280\" on the Sun with 0.14\" per pixel sampling. In addition,\nLEMUR is capable of measuring mass flows velocities (line shifts) down to 2\nkm/s or better.\nLEMUR has been proposed to ESA as the European contribution to the Solar C\nmission.",

Using 14 observations with the XMM-Newton spacecraft in\n2010-2011, we were able to measure a spin-down rate nudot=(-2.3+/-0.2)e-15 Hz/s\n(Pdot=(2.8+/-0.3)e-14 s/s), from which we infer a dipolar magnetic field of\n1.0e13 G. With reasonable confidence we were able to extend the timing solution\nback to archival XMM-Newton from 2002 and 2003, giving the same solution but\nwith considerably more precision. This gives RX J0420 the lowest dipole\nmagnetic field of the INSs. Our spectroscopy does not confirm the broad\nabsorption feature at 0.3 keV hinted at in earlier observations, although\ndifficulties in background subtraction near that energy make conclusions\ndifficult. With this, all 6 of the INSs that have confirmed periodicities now\nhave constrained spin-downs from coherent solutions. The evidence that the INSs\nare qualitatively different from rotation-powered pulsars now appears robust,\nwith the likely conclusion that their characteristic ages are systematically\nolder than their true ages, because their fields have decayed. The field decay\nprobably also causes them to be systematically hotter than pulsars of the same\n(true) age.",

The forthcoming Juno mission to\nJupiter might determine Jupiter's normalized moment of inertia NMoI=C/MR^2 by\nmeasuring Jupiter's pole precession and the Lense-Thirring acceleration of the\nspacecraft (C is the axial moment of inertia, and M and R are Jupiter's mass\nand mean radius, respectively). We investigate the possible range of NMoI\nvalues for Jupiter based on its measured gravitational field using a simple\ncore/envelope model of the planet assuming that J_2 and J_4 are perfectly known\nand are equal to their measured values. The model suggests that for fixed\nvalues of J_2 and J_4 a range of NMOI values between 0.2629 and 0.2645 can be\nfound. The Radau-Darwin relation gives a NMoI value that is larger than the\nmodel values by less than 1%. A low NMoI of ~ 0.236, inferred from a dynamical\nmodel (Ward & Canup, 2006, ApJ, 640, L91) is inconsistent with this range, but\nthe range is model dependent. Although we conclude that the NMoI is tightly\nconstrained by the gravity coefficients, a measurement of Jupiter's NMoI to a\nfew tenths of percent by Juno could provide an important constraint on\nJupiter's internal structure. We carry out a simplified assessment of the error\ninvolved in Juno's possible determination of Jupiter's NMoI.",

Although recent\nobservations gave evidence of the dominance of Kinetic Alfv\u00e9n Waves (KAW) at\nsub-ion scales with $\\omega<{\\omega_{ci}}$, other studies suggest that the KAW\nmode cannot carry the turbulence cascade down to electron scales and that the\nwhistler mode (i.e., $\\omega>\\omega_{ci}$) is more relevant. Here, we propose\nto study key properties of the short wavelength plasma modes under realistic SW\nconditions, typically $\\beta_i\\gtrsim \\beta_e\\sim 1$ and for high oblique\nangles of propagation $80^\\circ\\leq \\Theta_{\\bf kB}<90^\\circ$ as observed from\nthe Cluster data. The linear properties of the plasma modes under these\nconditions are poorly known, which contrasts with the well-documented cold\nplasma limit and/or moderate oblique angles of propagation ($\\Theta_{\\bf kB}\n<80^\\circ$). Based on linear solutions of the Vlasov kinetic theory, we discuss\nthe relevance of each plasma mode (fast, Bernstein, KAW, whistler) in carrying\nthe energy cascade down to electron scales. We show, in particular, that the\nshear Alfv\u00e9n mode extends at scales $k\\rho_i\\gtrsim1$ following either a\nwhistler mode ($\\omega>\\omega_{ci}$) or a KAW mode (with $\\omega<\\omega_{ci}$)\ndepending on the anisotropy $k_\\parallel/ k_\\perp$. This contrasts with the\nwell-accepted idea that the whistler branch develops as a continuation at high\nfrequencies of the fast magnetosonic mode. We show, furthermore, that the\nwhistler branch is more damped than the KAW one, which makes the latter a more\nrelevant candidate to carry the energy cascade down to electron scales. We\ndiscuss how these new findings may facilitate resolution of the controversy\nconcerning the nature of the small scale turbulence, and we discuss the\nimplications for present and future spacecraft wave measurements in the SW.",

The\nINPOP10a models did not include the solar gravitomagnetic field at all, so that\nits signature might have partly been removed in the data reduction process. On\nthe other hand, the Lense-Thirring precession may have been canceled to a\ncertain extent by the competing precessions caused by small mismodeling in the\nquadrupole mass moment of the Sun and in the PPN parameter beta entering the\nSchwarzschild-like 1PN precession, both modeled in INPOP10a. On the contrary,\nthe oblateness of Mercury itself has a negligible impact on its perihelion. The\nsame holds for the mismodelled actions of both the largest individual asteroids\nand the ring of the minor asteroids. Future analysis of more observations from\nthe currently ongoing MESSENGER mission will shed further light on such an\nissue which, if confirmed, might potentially challenge our present-day picture\nof the currently accepted laws of gravitation and/or of the physical properties\nof the Sun.",

The mission, which returned asteroid\nsamples to the Earth while overcoming various technical hurdles, ended on June\n13, 2010, with the planned atmospheric re-entry. In order to safely deliver the\nsample return capsule, the HAYABUSA spacecraft ended its 7-year journey in a\nbrilliant \"artificial fireball\" over the Australian desert. Spectroscopic\nobservation was carried out in the near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths\nbetween 3000 and 7500 \u00c5at 3 - 20 \u00c5resolution. Approximately 100 atomic\nlines such as Fe I, Mg I, Na I, Al I, Cr I, Mn I, Ni I, Ti I, Li I, Zn I, O I,\nand N I were identified from the spacecraft. Exotic atoms such as Cu I, Mo I,\nXe I and Hg I were also detected. A strong Li I line (6708 \u00c5) at a height of\n~55 km originated from the onboard Li-Ion batteries. The FeO molecule bands at\na height of ~63 km were probably formed in the wake of the spacecraft. The\neffective excitation temperature as determined from the atomic lines varied\nfrom 4500 K to 6000 K. The observed number density of Fe I was about 10 times\nmore abundant than Mg I after the spacecraft explosion. N2+(1-) bands from a\nshock layer and CN violet bands from the sample return capsule's ablating heat\nshield were dominant molecular bands in the near-ultraviolet region of 3000 -\n4000 \u00c5. OH(A-X) band was likely to exist around 3092 \u00c5. A strong shock\nlayer from the HAYABUSA spacecraft was rapidly formed at heights between 93 km\nand 83 km, which was confirmed by detection of N2+(1-) bands with a vibration\ntemperature of ~13000 K. Gray-body temperature of the capsule at a height of\n~42 km was estimated to be ~2437 K which is matched to a theoretical\nprediction. The final message of the HAYABUSA spacecraft and its sample return\ncapsule are discussed through our spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The magnetic field plays a pivotal role in many fields of Astrophysics. This\nis especially true for the physics of the solar atmosphere. Measuring the\nmagnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere is crucial to understand the\nnature of the underlying physical processes that drive the violent dynamics of\nthe solar corona -- that can also affect life on Earth.\nSolmeX, a fully equipped solar space observatory for remote-sensing\nobservations, will provide the first comprehensive measurements of the strength\nand direction of the magnetic field in the upper solar atmosphere. The mission\nconsists of two spacecraft, one carrying the instruments, and another one in\nformation flight at a distance of about 200m carrying the occulter to provide\nan artificial total solar eclipse. This will ensure high-quality coronagraphic\nobservations above the solar limb.\nSolmex integrates two spectro-polarimetric coronagraphs for off-limb\nobservations, one in the EUV and one in the IR, and three instruments for\nobservations on the disk. The latter comprises one imaging polarimeter in the\nEUV for coronal studies, a spectro-polarimeter in the EUV to investigate the\nlow corona, and an imaging spectro-polarimeter in the UV for chromospheric\nstudies.\nSOHO and other existing missions have investigated the emission of the upper\natmosphere in detail (not considering polarization), and as this will be the\ncase also for missions planned for the near future. Therefore it is timely that\nSolmeX provides the final piece of the observational quest by measuring the\nmagnetic field in the upper atmosphere through polarimetric observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The NEAT (Nearby Earth Astrometric Telescope) mission is a proposition\nsubmitted to ESA for its 2010 call for M-size mission. The main scientific goal\nis to detect and characterize planetary systems in an exhaustive way down to 1\nEarth mass in the habitable zone and further away, around nearby stars for F,\nG, and K spectral types. This survey would provide the actual planetary masses,\nthe full characterization of the orbits including their inclination, for all\nthe components of the planetary system down to that mass limit. Extremely-\nhigh-precision astrometry, in space, can detect the dynamical effect due to\neven low mass orbiting planets on their central star, reaching those scientific\ngoals. NEAT will continue the work performed by Hipparcos (1mas precision) and\nGaia (7{\\mu}as aimed) by reaching a precision that is improved by two orders of\nmagnitude (0.05{\\mu}as, 1{\\sigma} accuracy). The two modules of the payload,\nthe telescope and the focal plane, must be placed 40m away leading to a\nformation flying option studied as the reference mission. NEAT will operate at\nL2 for 5 years, the telescope satellite moving around the focal plane one to\npoint different targets and allowing whole sky coverage in less than 20 days.\nThe payload is made of 3 subsystems: primary mirror and its dynamic support,\nthe focal plane with the detectors, and the metrology. The principle is to\nmeasure the angles between the target star, usually bright (R \\leq 6), and\nfainter reference stars (R \\leq 11) using a metrology system that projects\ndynamical Young's fringes onto the focal plane. The proposed architecture\nrelies on two satellites of about 700 kg, offering a capability of more than\n20,000 reconfigurations. The two satellites are launched in a stacked\nconfiguration using a Soyuz ST launch, and are deployed after launch to\nindividually perform cruise to their operational Lissajous orbit.",

Our study and the comparison with the\nobservations suggest that the main crater features on Phoebe are unlikely to\nhave been produced in the present configuration of the Solar System and that\nthey must have been acquired when the SD were depleted in the early Solar\nSystem. If this is what happened and the craters were produced when Phoebe was\na satellite of Saturn, then it had to be captured, very early in the evolution\nof the Solar System.",

In this work we\nanalyze the evolution of a particular MC (observed on March 1998) using {\\it in\nsitu} observations made by two spacecraft approximately aligned with the Sun,\nthe first one at 1 AU from the Sun and the second one at 5.4 AU. We study the\nMC expansion, its consequent decrease of magnetic field intensity and mass\ndensity, and the possible evolution of the so-called global ideal-MHD\nnvariants. We describe the magnetic configuration of the MC at both spacecraft\nusing different models and compute relevant global quantities (magnetic fluxes,\nhelicity and energy) at both helio-distances. We also track back this structure\nto the Sun, in order to find out its solar source. We find that the flux rope\nis significantly distorted at 5.4 AU. However, we are able to analyze the data\nbefore the flux rope center is over-passed and compare it with observations at\n1 AU. From the observed decay of magnetic field and mass density, we quantify\nhow anisotropic is the expansion, and the consequent deformation of the flux\nrope in favor of a cross section with an aspect ratio at 5.4 AU of $\\approx\n1.6$ (larger in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction from the\nSun). We quantify the ideal-MHD invariants and magnetic energy at both\nlocations, and find that invariants are almost conserved, while the magnetic\nenergy decays as expected with the expansion rate found. The use of MHD\ninvariants to link structures at the Sun and the interplanetary medium is\nsupported by the results of this multispacecraft study. We also conclude that\nthe local dimensionless expansion rate, that is computed from the velocity\nprofile observed by a single spacecraft, is very accurate for predicting the\nevolution of flux ropes in the solar wind.",

These forecasting techniques use single-spacecraft imaging data and\nare based on the assumptions of constant velocity and direction. We show that\nfor the slow (350 km/s) ICME on 2009 February 13-18, observed at quadrature by\nthe two STEREO spacecraft, the results for the arrival time given by the HM\napproximation are more accurate by 12 hours than those for FP in comparison to\nin situ observations of solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters by\nSTEREO/IMPACT/PLASTIC, and by 6 hours for the arrival time at Venus Express\n(MAG). We propose that the improvement is directly related to the ICME front\nshape being more accurately described by HM for an ICME with a low inclination\nof its symmetry axis to the ecliptic. In this case the ICME has to be tracked\nto > 30\u00b0 elongation to get arrival time errors < 5 hours.
