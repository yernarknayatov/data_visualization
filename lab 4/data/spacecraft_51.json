The Cassini spacecraft has tracked the\nmotions of propellers for several years and finds that they deviate from\nKeplerian orbits having constant semimajor axes. The inferred orbital migration\nis known to switch sign. We show using a statistical test that the time series\nof orbital longitudes of the propeller Bl\u00e9riot is consistent with that of a\ntime-integrated Gaussian random walk. That is, Bl\u00e9riot's observed migration\npattern is consistent with being stochastic. We further show, using a\ncombination of analytic estimates and collisional N-body simulations, that\nstochastic migration of the right magnitude to explain the Cassini observations\ncan be driven by encounters with ring particles 10-20 m in radius. That the\nlocal ring mass is concentrated in decameter-sized particles is supported on\nindependent grounds by occultation analyses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and the\nevolution of stars. However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in\nstars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in\nstellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we\ndesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,\nwhich until very recently were restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report\nthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in the\ncore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giant\nKIC7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By\nperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that\nits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to\ndetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a\nstellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic\nproperties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal\nrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the\nstar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed\nnew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In\nparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular\nmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which\ncould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over\nthe last decades.",

Some of these ejections are detected in the\nsolar wind as magnetic clouds (MCs) that have flux rope signatures. Magnetic\nclouds are structures that typically expand in the inner heliosphere. We derive\nthe expansion properties of MCs in the outer heliosphere from one to five\nastronomical units to compare them with those in the inner heliosphere. We\nanalyze MCs observed by the Ulysses spacecraft using insitu magnetic field and\nplasma measurements. The MC boundaries are defined in the MC frame after\ndefining the MC axis with a minimum variance method applied only to the flux\nrope structure. As in the inner heliosphere, a large fraction of the velocity\nprofile within MCs is close to a linear function of time. This is indicative\nof} a self-similar expansion and a MC size that locally follows a power-law of\nthe solar distance with an exponent called zeta. We derive the value of zeta\nfrom the insitu velocity data. We analyze separately the non-perturbed MCs\n(cases showing a linear velocity profile almost for the full event), and\nperturbed MCs (cases showing a strongly distorted velocity profile). We find\nthat non-perturbed MCs expand with a similar non-dimensional expansion rate\n(zeta=1.05+-0.34), i.e. slightly faster than at the solar distance and in the\ninner heliosphere (zeta=0.91+-0.23). The subset of perturbed MCs expands, as in\nthe inner heliosphere, at a significantly lower rate and with a larger\ndispersion (zeta=0.28+-0.52) as expected from the temporal evolution found in\nnumerical simulations. This local measure of the expansion also agrees with the\ndistribution with distance of MC size,mean magnetic field, and plasma\nparameters. The MCs interacting with a strong field region, e.g. another MC,\nhave the most variable expansion rate (ranging from compression to\nover-expansion).",

Recent\nobservations of a number of galactic SNR strongly support the SNR-CR connection\nin general and the Fermi mechanism of CR acceleration, in particular. However,\nmany SNR expand into weakly ionized dense gases, and so a significant revision\nof the mechanism is required to fit the data. We argue that strong ion-neutral\ncollisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the energy\nspectrum of accelerated particles by \\emph{exactly one power}. The spectral\nbreak is caused by a partial evanescence of Alfven waves that confine particles\nto the accelerator.

We split the sample\nin two subsets: those MCs with a velocity profile that is significantly\nperturbed from the expected linear profile and those that are not. From the\nslope of the \\textit{in situ} measured bulk velocity along the Sun-Earth\ndirection, we compute an expansion speed with respect to the cloud center for\neach of the analyzed MCs. We analyze how the expansion speed depends on the MC\nsize, the translation velocity, and the heliocentric distance, finding that all\nMCs in the subset of non-perturbed MCs expand with almost the same\nnon-dimensional expansion rate ($\\zeta$). We find departures from this general\nrule for $\\zeta$ only for perturbed MCs, and we interpret the departures as the\nconsequence of a local and strong SW perturbation by SW fast streams, affecting\nthe MC even inside its interior, in addition to the direct interaction region\nbetween the SW and the MC. We also compute the dependence of the mean total SW\npressure on the solar distance and we confirm that the decrease of the total SW\npressure with distance is the main origin of the observed MC expansion rate. We\nfound that $\\zeta$ was $0.91\\pm 0.23$ for non-perturbed MCs while $\\zeta$ was\n$0.48\\pm 0.79$ for perturbed MCs, the larger spread in the last ones being due\nto the influence of the environment conditions on the expansion.",

Using a simultaneous\n195 \u00c5image from the Solar-Terrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO-B)\nspacecraft to identify the heliographic coordinates of the flare footpoints, we\ndetermine mean heights above the photosphere (as normally defined; \\tau = 1 at\n5000 \u00c5) of 305 \\pm 170 km and 195 \\pm 70 km, respectively, for the centroids\nof the hard X-ray (HXR) and white light (WL) footpoint sources of the flare.\nThese heights are unexpectedly low in the atmosphere, and are consistent with\nthe expected locations of \\tau = 1 for the 6173 \u00c5and the ~40 keV photons\nobserved, respectively.",

The detection\nsensitivity is shifted 52 times toward larger wavelength compared to that of\nLISA. The mission orbits of the 3 spacecraft forming a nearly equilateral\ntriangular array are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and\nL5. The 3 spacecraft range interferometrically with one another with arm length\nabout 260 million kilometers. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for\nASTROD-GW, laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the secondary noises\nsuch as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. For suppressing laser\nfrequency noise, we need to use time delay interferometry (TDI) to match the\ntwo different optical paths (times of travel). Since planets and other\nsolar-system bodies perturb the orbits of ASTROD-GW spacecraft and affect the\n(TDI), we simulate the time delay numerically using CGC 2.7 ephemeris\nframework. To conform to the ASTROD-GW planning, we work out a set of 20-year\noptimized mission orbits of ASTROD-GW spacecraft starting at June 21, 2028, and\ncalculate the residual optical path differences in the first and second\ngeneration TDI for one-detector case. In our optimized mission orbits for 20\nyears, changes of arm length are less than 0.0003 AU; the relative Doppler\nvelocities are less than 3m/s.

The objective\nof this work is to obtain X-ray images in the iron-line complex at 6.7 keV\nobserved during solar flares with an angular resolution as fine as 0.1 arcsec -\nover an order of magnitude finer than is now possible. This line emission is\nfrom highly ionized iron atoms, primarily Fe xxv, in the hottest flare plasma\nat temperatures in excess of \\approx10 MK. It provides information on the flare\nmorphology, the iron abundance, and the distribution of the hot plasma.\nStudying how this plasma is heated to such high temperatures in such short\ntimes during solar flares is of critical importance in understanding these\npowerful transient events, one of the major objectives of solar physics.

We compare the\npredictions of the Fixed-Phi and Harmonic Mean (HM) fitting methods, which only\ndiffer by the assumed geometry of the CME. It is possible to use these\ntechniques to determine from remote-sensing observations the CME direction of\npropagation, arrival time and final speed which are compared to in situ\nmeasurements. We find evidence that for large viewing angles, the HM fitting\nmethod predicts the CME direction better. However, this may be due to the fact\nthat only wide CMEs can be successfully observed when the CME propagates more\nthan 100 deg from the observing spacecraft. Overall eight CMEs, originating\nfrom behind the limb as seen by one of the STEREO spacecraft can be tracked and\ntheir arrival time at the other STEREO spacecraft can be successfully\npredicted.

As seen in many other similar systems, the gravitational field of\nthe white dwarf produces an ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB which appears in\nthe light curve as a modulation at two times the orbital frequency. The\nellipsoidal deformation of the sdB implies that the system has a maximum\ninclination of ~40 degrees, with i \\approx 20 degrees being the most likely.\nThe orbital radial velocity of the sdB star is high enough to produce a Doppler\nbeaming effect with an amplitude of 432 \\pm 5 ppm, clearly visible in the\nfolded light curve. The photometric amplitude that we obtain, K1 = 85.8 km/s,\nis ~12 per cent less than the spectroscopic RV amplitude of 97.2 \\pm 2.0 km/s.\nThe discrepancy is due to the photometric contamination from a close object at\nabout 5 arcsec North West of KIC 6614501, which is difficult to remove.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Low-frequency solar and interplanetary radio bursts are generated at\nfrequencies below the ionospheric plasma cutoff and must therefore be measured\nin space, with deployable antenna systems. The problem of measuring both the\ngeneral direction and polarization of an electromagnetic source is commonly\nsolved by iterative fitting methods such as linear regression that deal\nsimultaneously with both directional and polarization parameters. We have\ndeveloped a scheme that separates the problem of deriving the source direction\nfrom that of determining the polarization, avoiding iteration in a\nmulti-dimensional manifold. The crux of the method is to first determine the\nsource direction independently of concerns as to its polarization. Once the\nsource direction is known, its direct characterization in terms of Stokes\nvectors in a single iteration if desired, is relatively simple. This study\napplies the source-direction determination to radio signatures of flares\nreceived by STEREO. We studied two previously analyzed radio type III bursts\nand found that the results of the eigenvalue decomposition technique are\nconsistent with those obtained previously by Reiner et al. (Solar Phys. 259,\n255, 2009). For the type III burst observed on 7 December 2007, the difference\nin travel times from the derived source location to STEREO A and B is the same\nas the difference in the onset times of the burst profiles measured by the two\nspacecraft. This is consistent with emission originating from a single,\nrelatively compact source. For the second event of 29 January 2008, the\nrelative timing does not agree, suggesting emission from two sources separated\nby 0.1 AU, or perhaps from an elongated region encompassing the apparent source\nlocations.",

Nanosecond timing precision is needed to accurately form\nthese Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) combinations which defines a ~1 meter\nrequirement on the inter-spacecraft ranging capability. The University of\nFlorida Hardware-in-the-loop LISA Interferometry Simulator (UFLIS) has been\nused to test Time-Delay Interferometry in a configuration which incorporates\nvariable delays, realistic Doppler shifts, and simulated gravitational-wave\nsignals. The TDI 2.0 combinations are exploited to determine the time-changing\ndelays with nanosecond accuracy using a TDI-ranging reference tone. These\nvariable delays are used in forming the TDI combinations to achieve the LISA\ninterferometry sensitivity resulting from 10 orders of magnitude laser\nfrequency noise cancellation.",

In order to convert the\nexpansion speed to radial speed (which is important for space weather\napplications) one can use an empirical relationship between the two that\nassumes an average width for all CMEs. If we have the width information from\nquadrature observations, we can confirm the relationship between expansion and\nradial speeds derived by Gopalswamy et al. (2009a). The STEREO spacecraft were\nin qudrature with SOHO (STEREO-A ahead of Earth by 87o and STEREO-B 94o behind\nEarth) on 2011 February 15, when a fast Earth-directed CME occurred. The CME\nwas observed as a halo by the Large-Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)\non board SOHO. The sky-plane speed was measured by SOHO/LASCO as the expansion\nspeed, while the radial speed was measured by STEREO-A and STEREO-B. In\naddition, STEREO-A and STEREO-B images provided the width of the CME, which is\nunknown from Earth view. From the SOHO and STEREO measurements, we confirm the\nrelationship between the expansion speed (Vexp) and radial speed (Vrad) derived\npreviously from geometrical considerations (Gopalswamy et al. 2009a): Vrad =\n1/2 (1 + cot w)Vexp, where w is the half width of the CME. STEREO-B images of\nthe CME, we found that CME had a full width of 76o, so w = 38o. This gives the\nrelation as Vrad = 1.14 Vexp. From LASCO observations, we measured Vexp = 897\nkm/s, so we get the radial speed as 1023 km/s. Direct measurement of radial\nspeed yields 945 km/s (STEREO-A) and 1058 km/s (STEREO-B). These numbers are\ndifferent only by 7.6% and 3.4% (for STEREO-A and STEREO-B, respectively) from\nthe computed value.",

However, the\nanalysis of multi-spacecraft in-ecliptic IMF measurements from 0.29 AU to 5 AU\nshows that the IMF radial evolution is rather far from expected. The radial IMF\ncomponent decreases with the adiabatic power index (|Br| \\sim r^-5/3), the\ntangential component |Bt| \\sim r^-1.1 and, the IMF strength B \\sim r^-1.4. This\nmeans that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind. Possibly,\nturbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly influence the IMF\nexpansion. This means that the IMF is not completely frozen in the solar wind.\nIt is possible that turbulent processes in the inner heliosphere significantly\ninfluence the IMF expansion. This is confirmed by the analysis of the Br\ndistribution's radial evolution. We consider a quasi-continuous magnetic\nreconnection, occurring both at the heliospheric current sheet and at local\ncurrent sheets inside the IMF sectors, to be a key process responsible for the\nsolar wind turbulization with heliocentric distance as well as for the\nbreakdown of the frozen-in IMF law.",

The average velocities of the reflected waves are found\nto be smaller than the mean velocities of their associated direct waves.\nHowever, the kinematical study also reveals that in each case the end velocity\nof the primary wave matches the initial velocity of the reflected wave. In all\nthree events the primary and reflected waves obey the Huygens-Fresnel\nprinciple, as the incident angle with ~10\u00b0 to the normal is of the same\nsize as the angle of reflection. The correlation between the speed and the\nstrength of the primary EUV waves, the homologous appearance of both the\nprimary and the reflected waves, and in particular the EUV wave reflections\nthemselves implicate that the observed EUV transients are indeed nonlinear\nlarge-amplitude MHD waves.",

On the other hand, strong dust ejection anisotropies are\nrequired to fit the near-coma regions at large heliocentric distances (both\ninbound at $r_h$=2.5 AU and outbound at $r_h$=2.6 AU) for the 2002 apparition.\nThese asymmetries are compatible with a scenario where dust ejection is mostly\nseasonally-driven, coming mainly from regions near subsolar latitudes at far\nheliocentric distances inbound and outbound. At intermediate to near-perihelion\nheliocentric distances, the outgassing would affect much more extended latitude\nregions, the emission becoming almost isotropic near perihelion. We derived a\nmaximum dust production rate of 260 kg s$^{-1}$ at perihelion, and an averaged\nproduction rate over one orbit of 40 kg s$^{-1}$. An enhanced emission rate,\naccompanied also by a large ejection velocity, is predicted at $r_h>$2.5\npre-perihelion.\nThe model has also been extended to the thermal infrared in order to be\napplied to available trail observations with IRAS and ISO spacecrafts of this\ncomet. The modeled trail intensities are in good agreement with those\nobservations, which is remarkable taking into account that those data are\nsensitive to dust ejection patterns corresponding to several orbits before the\n2002 and 2009 apparitions.",

Both methods assume a constant\nvelocity in their descriptions of the time-elongation profiles of CMEs, which\nare used to fit the observed time-elongation data. Here, we analyze the effect\nof aerodynamic drag on CMEs propagating through interplanetary space, and how\nthis drag affects the result of the F\\Phi and HM fitting methods. A simple drag\nmodel is used to analytically construct time-elongation profiles which are then\nfitted with the two methods. It is found that higher angles and velocities give\nrise to greater error in both methods, reaching errors in the direction of\npropagation of up to 15 deg and 30 deg for the F\\Phi and HM fitting methods,\nrespectively. This is due to the physical accelerations of the CMEs being\ninterpreted as geometrical accelerations by the fitting methods. Because of the\ngeometrical definition of the HM fitting method, it is affected by the\nacceleration more greatly than the F\\Phi fitting method. Overall, we find that\nboth techniques overestimate the initial (and final) velocity and direction for\nfast CMEs propagating beyond 90 deg from the Sun-spacecraft line, meaning that\narrival times at 1 AU would be predicted early (by up to 12 hours). We also\nfind that the direction and arrival time of a wide and decelerating CME can be\nbetter reproduced by the F\\Phi due to the cancellation of two errors:\nneglecting the CME width and neglecting the CME deceleration.

As a novel element of our investigation, we develop a\nparameterized model for the thermal recoil force and estimate the coefficients\nof this model independently from navigational Doppler data. We find no\nstatistically significant difference between the two estimates and conclude\nthat once the thermal recoil force is properly accounted for, no anomalous\nacceleration remains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In late 2010 a Jupiter Family comet 103P/Hartley 2 was a subject of an\nintensive world-wide investigation. On UT October 20.7 the comet approached the\nEarth within only 0.12 AU, and on UT November 4.6 it was visited by NASA's\nEPOXI spacecraft. We joined this international effort and organized an\nobserving campaign. The images of the comet were obtained through narrowband\nfilters using the 2-m telescope of the Rozhen National Astronomical\nObservatory. They were taken during 4 nights around the moment of the EPOXI\nencounter. Image processing methods and periodicity analysis techniques were\nused to reveal transient coma structures and investigate their repeatability\nand kinematics. We observe shells, arc-, jet- and spiral-like patterns, very\nsimilar for the CN and C3 comae. The CN features expanded outwards with the\nsky-plane projected velocities between 0.1 to 0.3 km/s. A corkscrew structure,\nobserved on November 6, evolved with a much higher velocity of 0.66 km/s.\nPhotometry of the inner coma of CN shows variability with a period of\n18.32+/-0.30 h (valid for the middle moment of our run, UT 2010 Nov. 5.0835),\nwhich we attribute to the nucleus rotation. This result is fully consistent\nwith independent determinations around the same time by other teams. The\npattern of repeatability is, however, not perfect, which is understendable\ngiven the suggested excitation of the rotation state, and the variability\ndetected in CN correlates well with the cyclic changes in HCN, but only in the\nactive phases. The revealed coma structures, along with the snapshot of the\nnucleus orientation obtained by EPOXI, let us estimate the spin axis\norientation. We obtained RA=122 deg, Dec=+16 deg (epoch J2000.0), neglecting at\nthis point the rotational excitation.",

Just like LISA and\nASTROD-GW, in order to attain the requisite sensitivity for eLISA/NGO, laser\nfrequency noise must be suppressed to below the secondary noises such as the\noptical path noise, acceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have\nperformed the numerical simulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for\nLISA and ASTROD-GW with one arm dysfunctional by using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris.\nThe results are well below their respective limits which the laser frequency\nnoise is required to be suppressed. In this paper, we follow the same procedure\nto simulate the time delay interferometry numerically. To do this, we work out\na set of 1000-day optimized mission orbits of the eLISA/NGO spacecraft starting\nat January 1st, 2021 using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use the\nnumerical method to calculate the residual optical path differences in the\nsecond-generation TDI solutions as in our previous papers. The maximum path\nlength difference, for all configurations calculated, is below 13 mm (43 ps).\nIt is well below the limit which the laser frequency noise is required to be\nsuppressed for eLISA/NGO. We compare and discuss the resulting differences due\nto the different arm lengths for various mission proposals -- eLISA/NGO, an\nNGO-LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 x 10^6 km, LISA and\nASTROD-GW.",

Several intervals are\nidentified when the X-ray flux was exceptionally low, and the flux and solar\nX-ray luminosity are estimated. Spectral fits to the emission at these times\ngive temperatures of 1.7-1.9 MK and emission measures between 4 x 10^47 cm^-3\nand 1.1 x 10^48 cm^-3. Comparing SphinX emission with that from the Hinode\nX-ray Telescope, we deduce that most of the emission is from general coronal\nstructures rather than confined features like bright points. For one of 27\nintervals of exceptionally low activity identified in the SphinX data, the\nSun's X-ray luminosity in an energy range roughly extrapolated to that of ROSAT\n(0.1-2.4 keV) was less than most nearby K and M dwarfs.",

The situation is\nmodelled via first order ordinary differental equations where a stable target\nis considered. In order to prevent a collision of the two spacecrafts and to\nensure both satellites are docked at the end of the maneuver, additional state\nconstraints, box contraints for the control and a time dependent rendezvous\ncondition for the final time are added. The problem is formulated as an optimal\ncontrol problem with Bolza type cost functional and solved using a full\ndiscretization approach in AMPL/IpOpt.

The triangulation technique was used to derive the true\ndirection of propagation of this feature.

The first model\nis characterized by five degrees of freedom while the second one is\ncharacterized by ten degrees of freedom. The results show that the acceleration\nincreases smoothly and it is continuously increasing with height. We conclude\nthat the prominence is not accelerated immediately by local reconnection but\nrather is swept away as part of a large-scale relaxation of the coronal\nmagnetic field.",

In particular, kinetic effects such as temperature anisotropy and\nplasma heating are concentrated near coherent structures, such as current\nsheets, which are non-uniformly distributed in space. Furthermore, these\ncoherent structures are preferentially found in plasma unstable to the mirror\nand firehose instabilities. The inhomogeneous heating in these regions, which\nis present in both the magnetic field parallel and perpendicular temperature\ncomponents, results in protons at least 3-4 times hotter than under typical\nstable plasma conditions. These results offer a new understanding of kinetic\nprocesses in a turbulent regime, where linear Vlasov theory is not sufficient\nto explain the inhomogeneous plasma dynamics operating near non-Gaussian\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Ulysses investigated the high latitude Jovian magnetosphere for a second time\nafter Pioneer 11 mission and gave us the opportunity to search the structure\nand the dynamics of this giant magnetosphere above the magnetodisc.\nKivelson(1976) and Kennel & Coroniti(1979) reported that Pioneer 11 observed\nenergetic particle intensities at high latitudes at the same level with those\nmeasured in the plasma sheet and inferred that they were not consistent with\nthe magnetodisc model. Ulysses observations supported the idea about a\nlarge-scale layer of energetic ions and electrons in the outer high latitude\nJovian magnetosphere (Cowley et al.1996; Anagnostopoulos et al. 2001). This\nstudy perform a number of further tests for the existence of the large scale\nlayer of energetic ions in the outer high latitude Jovian magnetosphere by\nstudying appropriate cross-B field anisotropies in order to monitor the ion\nnorthward/southward intensity gradients. In particular, we examined\nUlysses/HI-SCALE observations of energetic ions with large gyro-radius\n(0.5-1.6MeV protons and >2.5MeV heavy(Z>5) ions) in order to compare instant\nintensity changes with remote sensing intensity gradients. Our analysis\nconfirms the existence of an energetic particle layer in the north hemisphere,\nduring the inbound trajectory of Ulysses traveling at moderate latitudes, and\nin the south high-latitude duskside magnetosphere, during the outbound segment\nof the spacecraft trajectory. Our Ulysses/HI-SCALE data analysis also provides\nevidence for the detection of an energetic proton magnetopause boundary layer\nduring the outbound trajectory of the spacecraft. During Ulysses flyby of\nJupiter the almost permanent appearance of alternative northward and southward\nintensity gradients suggests that the high latitude layer appeared to be a\nthird major area of energetic particles, which coexisted with the radiation\nbelts and the magnetodisc.",

We focus on small-scale portions within the\nobserved solar active region and discover the appearance of very distinctive\nsmall-scale and short-lived dark features in Ca II H chromospheric filtergrams\nand Stokes I images. The features appear in regions with close-to-zero\nlongitudinal magnetic field, and are observed to increase in length before they\neventually disappear. Energy release in the low chromospheric line is detected\nwhile the dark features are fading. In time series of magnetograms a diverging\nbipolar configuration is observed accompanying the appearance of the dark\nfeatures and the brightenings. The observed phenomena are explained as\nevidencing elementary flux emergence in the solar atmosphere, i.e small-scale\narch filament systems rising up from the photosphere to the lower chromosphere\nwith a length scale of a few solar granules. Brightenings are explained as\nbeing the signatures of chromospheric heating triggered by reconnection of the\nrising loops (once they reached chromospheric heights) with pre-existing\nmagnetic fields as well as to reconnection/cancellation events in U-loop\nsegments of emerging serpentine fields. We study the temporal evolution and\ndynamics of the events and compare them with the emergence of magnetic loops\ndetected in quiet sun regions and serpentine flux emergence signatures in\nactive regions. Incorporating the novel features of granular-scale flux\nemergence presented in this study we advance the scenario for serpentine flux\nemergence.",
