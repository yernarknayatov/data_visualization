    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents a novel Lagrangian approach to attitude tracking for\nrigid spacecraft using unit quaternions, where the motion equations of a\nspacecraft are described by a four degrees of freedom Lagrangian dynamics\nsubject to a holonomic constraint imposed by the norm of a unit quaternion. The\nbasic energy-conservation property as well as some additional useful properties\nof the Lagrangian dynamics are explored, enabling to develop quaternion-based\nattitude tracking controllers by taking full advantage of a broad class of\ntracking control designs for mechanical systems based on energy-shaping\nmethodology. Global tracking of a desired attitude on the unit sphere is\nachieved by designing control laws that render the tracking error on the\nfour-dimensional Euclidean space to converge to the origin. The topological\nconstraints for globally exponentially tracking by a quaternion-based\ncontinuous controller and singularities in controller designs based on any\nthree-parameter representation of the attitude are then avoided. Using this\napproach, a full-state feedback controller is first developed, and then several\nimportant issues, such as robustness to noise in quaternion measurements,\nunknown on-orbit torque disturbances, uncertainty in the inertial matrix, and\nlack of angular-velocity measurements are addressed progressively, by designing\na hybrid state-feedback controller, an adaptive hybrid state-feedback\ncontroller, and an adaptive hybrid attitude-feedback controller. Global\nasymptotic stability is established for each controller. Simulations are\nincluded to illustrate the theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In recent years, deep learning techniques have been introduced into the field\nof trajectory optimization to improve convergence and speed. Training such\nmodels requires large trajectory datasets. However, the convergence of low\nthrust (LT) optimizations is unpredictable before the optimization process\nends. For randomly initialized low thrust transfer data generation, most of the\ncomputation power will be wasted on optimizing infeasible low thrust transfers,\nwhich leads to an inefficient data generation process. This work proposes a\ndeep neural network (DNN) classifier to accurately identify feasible LT\ntransfer prior to the optimization process. The DNN-classifier achieves an\noverall accuracy of 97.9%, which has the best performance among the tested\nalgorithms. The accurate low-thrust trajectory feasibility identification can\navoid optimization on undesired samples, so that the majority of the optimized\nsamples are LT trajectories that converge. This technique enables efficient\ndataset generation for different mission scenarios with different spacecraft\nconfigurations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The velocity of alpha particles relative to protons can vary depending on the\nsolar wind type and distance from the Sun (Marsch 2012). Measurements from the\nprevious spacecraft provided the alpha-proton's differential velocities down to\n0.3 au. Parker Solar Probe (PSP) now enables insights into differential flows\nof newly accelerated solar wind closer to the Sun for the first time. Here, we\nstudy the difference between proton and alpha bulk velocities near PSP\nperihelia of Encounters 3-7 when the core solar wind is in the field of view of\nthe Solar Probe Analyzer for Ions (SPAN-I) instrument. As previously reported\nat larger heliospheric distances, the alpha-proton differential speed observed\nby PSP is greater for fast wind than the slow solar wind. We compare PSP\nobservations with various spacecraft measurements and present the radial and\ntemporal evolution of the alpha-proton differential speed. The differential\nflow decreases as the solar wind propagates from the Sun, consistent with\nprevious observations. While Helios showed a small radial dependence of\ndifferential flow for the slow solar wind, PSP clearly showed this dependency\nfor the young slow solar wind down to 0.09 au. Our analysis shows that the\nalpha-proton differential speed's magnitude is mainly below the local Alfv\u00e9n\nspeed. Moreover, alpha particles usually move faster than protons close to the\nSun. PSP crossed the Alfv\u00e9n surface during its eighth Encounter and may cross\nit in future Encounters, enabling us to investigate the differential flow very\nclose to the solar wind acceleration source region for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Isotopic abundances in comets are key to understanding the history and origin\nof material in the Solar System. Deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) ratios in water\nare available for several comets. However, no long-term studies of the D/H\nratio in water of a comet during its passage around the Sun have been reported.\nLinear alkanes are important organic molecules, which have been found on\nseveral Solar System bodies, including comets. To date, only upper limits of\nisotopic ratios for D/H and 13C/12C in linear alkanes are available.\nThe aim of this work is a detailed analysis of the D/H ratio in water during\nthe whole Rosetta mission. In addition, a first determination of the D/H and\n13C/12C ratios in the first four linear alkanes in the coma of\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is provided. We analysed in situ measurements from\nthe Rosetta/ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS).\nThe D/H ratio from HDO/H2O and the 16O/17O ratio from H216O/H217O did not\nchange during 67P's passage around the Sun between 2014 and 2016. All D/H ratio\nmeasurements were compatible, within 1$\\sigma$, with the mean value of\n$5.01\\times10^{-4}$ and its relative variation of 2.0%. This suggests that the\nD/H ratio in 67P's coma is independent of heliocentric distance, level of\ncometary activity, as well as spacecraft location with respect to the nucleus.\nAdditionally, the 16O/17O ratio could be determined with a higher accuracy than\npreviously possible, yielding a value of 2347 with a relative variation of\n2.3%. For the alkanes, the D/H ratio is between 4.1 and 4.8 times higher than\nin H2O, while the 13C/12C ratio is compatible, within uncertainties, with data\nfor other Solar System objects. The relatively high D/H ratio in alkanes is in\nline with other cometary organic molecules and suggests that these organics may\nbe inherited from the presolar molecular cloud from which the Solar System\nformed.",

Advanced\nextraterrestrial civilizations may use free-floating planets as interstellar\ntransportation for space exploration and interstellar colonization. Large\ngroups or populations of their biological species, post-biological species, and\ntechnologies may become Cosmic Hitchhikers when they ride free-floating planets\nto reach, explore and colonize planetary systems. To get an interstellar ride,\nCosmic Hitchhikers may travel to free-floating planets passing close by their\nhome worlds. Otherwise, they may use astronomical engineering to steer\nfree-floating planets toward their home planetary systems. Cosmic Hitchhikers\nmay also ride objects native to the outer regions of their planetary systems,\nwhich become free-floating planets when ejected by astronomical engineering or\nby their stars during the asymptotic giant branch evolution. During\ninterstellar travel, Cosmic Hitchhikers may apply astronomical engineering to\nsteer their free-floating planets toward the planetary systems of their choice.\nWhereas riding free-floating planets may not save travel time, it avoids the\ntechnical challenges of interstellar spacecraft transporting large populations.\nEach civilization of Cosmic Hitchhikers may colonize several planetary systems.\nIts colonies may grow into autonomous civilizations, changing the number of\ncivilizations in the Galaxy. Over the last 4 billion years, Cosmic Hitchhikers\nor their artifacts riding free-floating planets might have passed by the Solar\nSystem.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA) selected LiteBIRD in May 2019 as a strategic large-class\n(L-class) mission, with an expected launch in the late 2020s using JAXA's H3\nrocket. LiteBIRD is planned to orbit the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, where\nit will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization over the entire\nsky for three years, with three telescopes in 15 frequency bands between 34 and\n448 GHz, to achieve an unprecedented total sensitivity of 2.2$\\mu$K-arcmin,\nwith a typical angular resolution of 0.5$^\\circ$ at 100 GHz. The primary\nscientific objective of LiteBIRD is to search for the signal from cosmic\ninflation, either making a discovery or ruling out well-motivated inflationary\nmodels. The measurements of LiteBIRD will also provide us with insight into the\nquantum nature of gravity and other new physics beyond the standard models of\nparticle physics and cosmology. We provide an overview of the LiteBIRD project,\nincluding scientific objectives, mission and system requirements, operation\nconcept, spacecraft and payload module design, expected scientific outcomes,\npotential design extensions and synergies with other projects.",

For slow scans and long\nintegration times, the probability of failure (Pfail) is determined by the\nintegrated jitter power up to a critical frequency, which we verify by\ncomparing the results of an analytical model to those of Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Jitter above the critical frequency leads to a loss of correlation\nbetween integration windows and decreases Pfail for both, 1d (radial) and 2d\n(radial and tangential) jitter, as long as the RMS jitter amplitude does not\nexceed the beam diameter. In the opposite limit of fast scans and short\nintegration times, emergent correlations between jitter fluctuations on two\nadjacent scanning tracks also decrease Pfail. The analytical model is\nadditionally used to assess the effect of multiple overlapping tracks and the\nimpact of target drifts in the uncertainty plane.",

These events have been suggested to be caused by particles\nwith diameters larger than 10 micrometers. Here, we compare the reported event\nrates to expected dust impact rates using dynamical meteoroid models for the\nfour most abundant meteoroid/dust populations in the inner solar system. We\nfind that the dust impact rates predicted by dynamical meteoroid models are not\ncompatible with either the Juno observations in terms of the number of star\ntracker events per day, or with the variations of dust flux on Juno's solar\npanels with time and position in the solar system. For example, the rate of\nstar tracker events on Juno's anti-sunward surfaces is the largest during a\nperiod during which Juno is expected to experience the peak impact fluxes on\nthe opposite, sunward hemisphere. We also investigate the hypothesis of dust\nleaving the Martian Hill sphere originating either from the surface of Mars\nitself or from one of its moons. We do not find such a hypothetical source to\nbe able to reproduce the star tracker event rate variations observed by Juno.\nWe conclude that the star tracker events observed by Juno are unlikely to be\nthe result of instantaneous impacts from the Zodiacal Cloud.",

In\nthis paper, we analyze these datasets with machine learning models to determine\nwhat upstream factors drive the lobe convection in different magnetotail\nregions and thereby understand the mechanisms that control the dynamics of the\ntail lobes. Our results show that the correlations between the predicted and\ntest convection velocities for the machine learning models (>0.75) are much\nbetter than those of the multiple linear regression model (~ 0.23 - 0.43).

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for LISA\ndesigned to suppress the otherwise overwhelming laser noise by several orders\nof magnitude. It is widely believed that TDI can only be applied once all phase\nor frequency measurements from each spacecraft have been synchronized to a\ncommon time frame. We demonstrate analytically, using as an example the\ncommonly-used Michelson combination X, that TDI can be computed using the raw,\nunsynchronized data, thereby avoiding the need for the initial synchronization\nprocessing step and significantly simplifying the initial noise reduction\npipeline for LISA. Furthermore, the raw data is free of any potential artifacts\nintroduced by clock synchronization and reference frame transformation\nalgorithms, which allows to operate directly on the MHz beatnotes. As a\nconsequence, in-band clock noise is directly suppressed as part of TDI, in\ncontrast to the approach previously proposed in the literature, in which large\ntrends in the beatnotes are removed before the main laser-noise reduction step\nand clock noise is suppressed in an extra processing step. We validate our\nalgorithm with fullscale numerical simulations that use LISA Instrument and\nPyTDI and show that we reach the same performance levels as the previously\nproposed methods, ultimately limited by the clock sideband stability.",

Here we show global MHD\nsimulations of resonant waves impulsively-excited by a solar wind pressure\npulse. Although many aspects of the surface, fast magnetosonic\n(cavity/waveguide), and Alfv\u00e9n modes present agree with the box and axially\nsymmetric dipole models, we find some predictions for large-scale waves are\nsignificantly altered in a realistic magnetosphere. The radial ordering of fast\nmode turning points and Alfv\u00e9n resonant locations may be reversed even with\nmonotonic wave speeds. Additional nodes along field lines that are not present\nin the displacement/velocity occur in both the perpendicular and compressional\ncomponents of the magnetic field. Close to the magnetopause the perpendicular\noscillations of the magnetic field have the opposite handedness to the\nvelocity. Finally, widely-used detection techniques for standing waves, both\nacross and along the field, can fail to identify their presence. We explain how\nall these features arise from the MHD equations when accounting for a\nnon-uniform background field and propose modified methods which might be\napplied to spacecraft observations.",

Accounting for spacecraft dynamics while avoiding collisions between\nthe agents makes spacecraft swarm trajectory planning difficult. Centralized\napproaches can be used to solve this problem, but are computationally demanding\nand scale poorly with the number of agents in the swarm. As a result,\ncentralized algorithms are ill-suited for real time trajectory planning on\nboard small spacecraft (e.g. CubeSats) comprising the swarm.

The\nnecessary training data is generated using a centralized convex optimization\nframework through which several instances of the n=10 spacecraft swarm\ntrajectory planning problem are solved. We are interested in answering the\nfollowing questions which will give insight on the potential utility of deep\nlearning-based approaches to the multi-spacecraft motion planning problem: 1)\nCan neural networks produce feasible trajectories that satisfy safety\nconstraints (e.g. collision avoidance) and low in fuel cost? 2) Can a neural\nnetwork trained using n spacecraft data be used to solve problems for\nspacecraft swarms of differing size?",

Assessing their accuracy is a complex task and there are multiple\nobservational pathways to provide constraints and tune model parameters. Here,\nwe combine several such independent constraints, defining a model-agnostic\nframework for standardized comparison. We require models to predict the\ndistribution of coronal holes at the photosphere, and neutral line topology at\nthe model outer boundary. We compare these predictions to extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV) observations of coronal hole locations, white-light Carrington maps of\nthe streamer belt and the magnetic sector structure measured \\textit{in situ}\nby Parker Solar Probe and 1AU spacecraft. We study these metrics for Potential\nField Source Surface (PFSS) models as a function of source surface height and\nmagnetogram choice, as well as comparing to the more physical Wang-Sheeley-Arge\n(WSA) and the Magnetohydrodynamics Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) models. We\nfind that simultaneous optimization of PFSS models to all three metrics is not\ncurrently possible, implying a trade-off between the quality of representation\nof coronal holes and streamer belt topology. WSA and MAS results show the\nadditional physics they include addresses this by flattening the streamer belt\nwhile maintaining coronal hole sizes, with MAS also improving coronal hole\nrepresentation relative to WSA. We conclude that this framework is highly\nuseful for inter- and intra-model comparisons. Integral to the framework is the\nstandardization of observables required of each model, evaluating different\nmodel aspects.",

Here we use various $1024^3$ direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) data of free-decay isothermal CHMHD turbulence obtained with\nthe GHOST code (Geophysical High-Order Suite for Turbulence) to analyze two of\nthe recently derived exact laws. The simulations reflect different intensities\nof the initial Mach number and the background magnetic field. The analysis\ndemonstrates the equivalence of the two laws in the inertial range and relates\nthe strength of the Hall effect to the amplitude of the cascade rate at sub-ion\nscales. When taken in their general form (i.e., not limited to the inertial\nrange) some subtleties regarding the validity of the stationarity assumption or\nthe absence of the forcing in the simulations are discussed. We show that the\nfree-decay nature of the turbulence induces a shift from a large scale forcing\ntowards the presence of a scale-dependent reservoir of energy fueling the\ncascade or dissipation. The reduced form of the exact laws (valid in the\ninertial range) ultimately holds even if the stationarity assumption is not\nfully verified.",

In our scenario, a formation of equally\nspaced spacecraft need to undergo an autonomous reconfiguration due to the\ndeorbiting of a satellite in the formation.

To achieve this goal, we\nconsider two decentralized strategies that rely on different sets of\ninformation about the neighboring spacecraft in the formation.

We first identified the\njets in soft X-ray (SXR) images from the X-ray telescope (XRT) on the Hinode\nspacecraft, over 2014-2016. During this period, frequently the polar holes were\nsmall or largely obscured by foreground coronal haze, often making jets\ndifficult to see. We selected 23 jets among those adequately visible during\nthis period, and examined them further using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171, 193, 211, and 304 Ang images. In SXRs\nwe track the lateral drift of the jet spire relative to the jet base's jet\nbright point (JBP). In 22 of 23 jets the spire either moves away from (18\ncases) or is stationary relative to (4 cases) the JBP. The one exception where\nthe spire moved toward the JBP may be a consequence of line-of-sight projection\neffects at the limb. From the AIA images, we clearly identify an erupting\nminifilament in 20 of the 23 jets, while the remainder are consistent with such\nan eruption having taken place. We also confirm that some jets can trigger\nonset of nearby \"sympathetic\" jets, likely because eruption of the minifilament\nfield of the first jet removes magnetic constraints on the base-field region of\nthe second jet. The propensity for spire drift away from the JBP, the\nidentification of the erupting minifilament in the majority of jets, and the\nmagnetic-field topological changes that lead to sympathetic jets, all support\nor are consistent with the minifilament-eruption model for jets.",

Most of these persistent\npatterns appear to have roughly constant pattern speeds, but there is at least\none structure in the planet's gravitational field whose rotation rate steadily\nincreased between 1970 and 2010. This gravitational field structure appears to\ninduce two different asymmetries in the planet's gravity field, one with\nazimuthal wavenumber 3 that rotates at roughly 810 degrees/day and another with\nazimuthal wavenumber 1 rotating three times faster. The atmospheric processes\nresponsible for generating the latter pattern may involve solar tides.",

The LECP\ninstrument includes a dual-ended solid state detector particle telescope\nmechanically scanning through 360 deg across eight equally-spaced angular\nsectors. As reported previously, LECP measurements showed a dramatic increase\nin GCR intensities for all sectors of the >=211 MeV count rate (CH31) at the V1\nheliopause (HP) crossing in 2012, however, since then the count rate data have\ndemonstrated systematic episodes of intensity decrease for particles around\n90\u00b0 pitch angle. To shed light on the energy dependence of these GCR\nanisotropies over a wide range of energies, we use V1 LECP count rate and pulse\nheight analyzer (PHA) data from >=211 MeV channel together with lower energy\nLECP channels. Our analysis shows that while GCR anisotropies are present over\na wide range of energies, there is a decreasing trend in the amplitude of\nsecond-order anisotropy with increasing energy during anisotropy episodes. A\nstronger pitch-angle scattering at the higher velocities is argued as a\npotential cause for this energy dependence. A possible cause for this velocity\ndependence arising from weak rigidity dependence of the scattering mean free\npath and resulting velocity-dominated scattering rate is discussed. This\ninterpretation is consistent with a recently reported lack of corresponding GCR\nelectron anisotropies.",

However, stellar interferometers from space\nhave not been realized because of technical difficulties. Two beams coming from\nindividual satellites separated by more than a few tens of meters should\nprecisely interfere such that the optical-path and angular differences between\nthe two beams are reduced at the wavelength level. Herein, we propose a novel\nbeam combiner for space interferometers that records the spectrally-resolved\ninterferometric fringes using the densified pupil spectroscopic technique. As\nthe detector plane is optically conjugated to a plane, on which the two beams\ninterfere, we can directly measure the relative phase difference between the\ntwo beams. Additionally, when an object within the field of view is obtained\nwith a modest signal-to-noise ratio, we can extract the true complex amplitude\nfrom a continuous broadband fringe (i.e., one exposure measurement), without\nscanning a delay line and chopping interferometry. We discovered that this\nspectral imaging method is validated for observing the solar system objects by\nsimulating the reflected light from Europa with a small stellar interferometer.\nHowever, because the structure of the object spectrum may cause a systematic\nerror in the measurement, this method may be limited in extracting the true\ncomplex amplitude for other astronomical objects. Applying this spectral\nimaging method to general astrophysics will facilitate further research. The\nbeam combiner and spectral imaging method are applied to a formation-flying\nstellar interferometer with multiple small satellites in a Sun-synchronous\norbit for observation of the solar system objects in visible and near-infrared.\nWe present an overview of SEIRIOS and the optimized optical design for a\nlimited-volume spacecraft.",

An initial run using binned light curve data was performed to identify\ngeneral parameter trends and provide initializing distributions for a\nsubsequent analysis incorporating the full data set. We present theoretical\nmodels for all three binaries, along with posterior distributions from our MCMC\nanalyses.

Other solar conjunctions will follow during the cruise phase,\nproviding several opportunities to improve the results of the first experiment.\nMORE radio tracking system allows to establish precise ranging and Doppler\nmeasurements almost at all solar elongation angles (up to 7-8 solar radii),\nthus providing an accurate measurement of the relativistic time delay and\nfrequency shift experienced by a radio signal during an SSC. The final\nobjective of the experiment is to place new limits to the accuracy of the GR as\na theory of gravity in the weak-field limit. As in all gravity experiments,\nnon-gravitational accelerations acting on the spacecraft are a major concern.\nBecause of the proximity to the Sun, the spacecraft will undergo severe solar\nradiation pressure acceleration, and the effect of the random fluctuations of\nthe solar irradiance may become a significant source of spacecraft buffeting.\nIn this paper we address the problem of a realistic estimate of the outcome of\nthe SSC experiments of BepiColombo, by including in the dynamical model the\neffects of random variations in the solar irradiance.

It instead employs a Jupiter Oberth Manoeuvre (JOM) with a total\ntime of flight of around 26 years or so. The efficacy of this trajectory is a\nresult of it significantly reducing the $\\Delta$V to Jupiter by exploiting the\nVEEGA sequence. The total $\\Delta$V of the trajectory is 15.8 $kms^{-1}$ and\nthe corresponding payload mass is 115 kg for a SLS Block 1B or 241 kg for a\nBlock 2. A further advantage of the JOM is that the arrival speed relative to\n1I/'Oumuamua is approximately 18 $kms^{-1}$, much lower than the equivalent for\nthe SOM of around 30 $kms^{-1}$.",

This tether-net system is\nsubject to several sources of uncertainty in sensing and actuation that affect\nthe performance of its net launch and closing control. Earlier\nreliability-based optimization approaches to design control actions however\nremain challenging and computationally prohibitive to generalize over varying\nlaunch scenarios and target (debris) state relative to the chaser. To search\nfor a general and reliable control policy, this paper presents a reinforcement\nlearning framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization (PPO2)\napproach with net dynamics simulations. The latter allows evaluating the\nepisodes of net-based target capture, and estimate the capture quality index\nthat serves as the reward feedback to PPO2. Here, the learned policy is\ndesigned to model the timing of the net closing action based on the state of\nthe moving net and the target, under any given launch scenario. A stochastic\nstate transition model is considered in order to incorporate synthetic\nuncertainties in state estimation and launch actuation. Along with notable\nreward improvement during training, the trained policy demonstrates capture\nperformance (over a wide range of launch/target scenarios) that is close to\nthat obtained with reliability-based optimization run over an individual\nscenario.",

The distribution of the apparent rotation speed of DAMs\nderived from multiple spacecraft suggests that the rotation speed of Io-related\nDAMs is in range of 0.15-0.6{\\Omega}_J and that of non-Io-DAMs is between\n0.7-1.2{\\Omega}_J. Based on the method of Wang et al. (2020), we locate the\nsources of the DAMs and infer their emission angles and associated electron\nenergies. The statistical results show that the DAM source locations have three\npreferred regions, two in the southern hemisphere and one in the northern\nhemisphere, which is probably caused by the non-symmetrical topology of\nJupiter's magnetic field. The difference between Io-DAM source footprints and\nIo auroral spots changes with the Io's position in longitude, consistent with\nthe previous results from Hess et al. (2010), Bonfond et al.

In addition, the emission angles for non-Io-DAMs are smaller\nthan that for Io-DAMs from the same source regions and all the emission angles\nrange from 60\u00b0 to 85\u00b0.

The photospheric magnetic field model includes a\nglobal dipole giving rise to a streamer together with a large parasitic\npolarity region giving rise to a pseudostreamer that separates a satellite\ncoronal hole from the main polar hole. Our numerical domain extends out to 30\nsolar radii and includes an isothermal solar wind, so that the coupling between\nthe corona and heliosphere can be calculated rigorously. This system is driven\nby imposing a large set of quasi-random surface flows that capture the driving\nof coronal flux in the vicinity of streamer and pseudostreamer boundaries by\nthe supergranular motions. We describe the resulting structures and dynamics.\nInterchange reconnection dominates the evolution at both streamer and\npseudostreamer boundaries, but the details of the resulting structures are\nclearly different from one another. Additionally, we calculate in situ\nsignatures of the reconnection and determine the dynamic mapping from the inner\nheliosphere back to the Sun for a test spacecraft orbit.

These demonstrations will pave the way for JAXA's envisioned\nlow-cost, high-frequency space exploration plans.

The main challenges include the optimization of the\nmany-revolution low-thrust spiral phase under operational constraints; the\ndesign of a multi-lunar-flyby sequence in a multi-body environment; and the\ndesign of multiple asteroid flybys connected via Earth gravity assists. This\npaper shows a novel, practical approach to tackle these complex problems, and\npresents feasible solutions found within the mass budget and mission\nconstraints. Among them, the baseline solution is shown and discussed in depth;\nDESTINY+ will spend two years raising its apogee with ion engines, followed by\nfour lunar gravity assists, and a flyby of asteroids (3200) Phaethon and\n(155140) 2005 UD.

The\ndevelopment of new modeling tools which are able to account for the\nmultidisciplinary nature of this problem becomes extremely relevant in order to\nmeet both structure and control performance criteria. This paper proposes a\nnovel methodology to analytically model large truss structures in a\nsub-structuring framework. A three dimensional unit cube element has been\ndesigned and validated with a Finite Element commercial software. This model is\ncomposed by multiple two-dimensional sub-mechanisms assembled using\nblock-diagram models. This constitutes the building block for constructing\ncomplex truss structures by repetitions of the element. The accurate vibration\ndescription of the system and its minimal representation, as well as the\npossibility of accounting for parametric uncertainties in its mechanical\nparameters, make it an appropriate tool to perform robust Structure/Control\nco-design. In order to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach, a\nco-design study case is proposed by combining a multidisciplinary optimization\napproach based on particle swarm algorithm and multiple structured robust\nHinf-synthesis. This has been used to optimize the pointing performances of an\nhigh pointing antenna, minimizing the perturbations coming from the Solar Array\nMechanisms (SADM) of two solar panels, performing active control by means of\nmultiple proof mass actuators, and simultaneously reduce the mass of the\ntruss-structure which connects the antenna to the main spacecraft body.",

For simplicity,\nmost previous numerical simulations of the impact used a spherical projectile\ngeometry to model the DART spacecraft. To investigate the effects of\nalternative, simple projectile geometries on the DART impact outcome we used\nthe iSALE shock physics code in two and thee-dimensions to model vertical\nimpacts of projectiles with a mass and speed equivalent to the nominal DART\nimpact, into porous basalt targets. We found that the simple projectile\ngeometries investigated here have minimal effects on the crater morphology and\nmomentum enhancement. Projectile geometries modelled in two-dimensions that\nhave similar surface areas at the point of impact, affect the crater radius and\nthe crater volume by less than 5%. In the case of a more extreme projectile\ngeometry (i.e., a rod, modelled in three-dimensions), the crater was elliptical\nand 50% shallower compared to the crater produced by a spherical projectile of\nthe same momentum. The momentum enhancement factor in these test cases,\ncommonly referred to as beta, was within 7% for the 2D simulations and within\n10% for the 3D simulations, of the value obtained for a uniform spherical\nprojectile. The most prominent effects of projectile geometry are seen in the\nejection velocity as a function of launch position and ejection angle of the\nfast ejecta that resides in the so-called `coupling zone'.

Inferring the albedo map of\na planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps\nmay yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by\nchanging clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated\nphotometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free\nsurface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a\nBayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a\nplanet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on\nsynthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth.\nWe find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to\nreconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to\nmake assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible\nphotometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location\nis a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the\nEarth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach\nremoves only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the\nfull-phase geometry of observations combined with the short correlation length\nfor Earth clouds. For exoplanets with Earth-like climatology, it may be hard to\ndo much better than a cloud-averaged map. We surmise that cloud removal will be\nmost successful for exoplanets imaged near quarter phase that harbour large\ncloud systems.",

The two most significant events from this set (of GOES class B2\nand B6) were observed on-disk from the spacecraft as well as from Earth and\nanalysed in terms of the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics.\nWe complement the observations from the STIX instrument with EUV imagery from\nSDO/AIA and GOES soft X-ray data by adding imaging and plasma diagnostics over\ndifferent temperature ranges for a detailed microflare case study that is\nfocussed on energy release and transport.\nSpectral fitting of the STIX data shows clear nonthermal emission for both\nmicroflares studied here. The deduced plasma parameters from DEM reconstruction\nas well as spectral fitting roughly agree with the values in the literature for\nmicroflares as do the nonthermal fit parameters from STIX. The observed Neupert\neffects and impulsive and gradual phases indicate that both events covered in\nthis study are consistent with the standard chromospheric evaporation flare\nscenario. For the B6 event on 7 June 2020, this interpretation is further\nsupported by the temporal evolution seen in the DEM profiles of the flare\nribbons and loops. For this event, we also find that accelerated electrons can\nroughly account for the required thermal energy. The 6 June 2020 event\ndemonstrates that STIX can detect nonthermal emission for GOES class B2 events\nthat is nonetheless smaller than the background rate level. We demonstrate for\nthe first time how detailed multi-instrument studies of solar flares can be\nperformed with STIX.",
