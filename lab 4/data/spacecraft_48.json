    "abstract": "Abstract:  Saturn's C ring contains multiple spiral patterns that appear to be density\nwaves driven by periodic gravitational perturbations. In other parts of\nSaturn's rings, such waves are generated by Lindblad resonances with Saturn's\nvarious moons, but most of the wave-like C-ring features are not situated near\nany strong resonance with any known moon. Using stellar occultation data\nobtained by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the\nCassini spacecraft, we investigate the origin of six unidentified C-ring waves\nlocated between 80,900 and 87,200 km from Saturn's center. By measuring\ndifferences in the waves' phases among the different occultations, we are able\nto determine both the number of arms in each spiral pattern and the speeds at\nwhich these patterns rotate around the planet. We find that all six of these\nwaves have between 2 and 4 arms and pattern speeds between 1660 degrees/day and\n1861 degrees/day. These speeds are too large to be attributed to any satellite\nresonance. Instead they are comparable to the predicted pattern speeds of waves\ngenerated by low-order normal-mode oscillations within the planet [Marley &\nPorco 1993, Icarus 106, 508]. The precise pattern speeds associated with these\nwaves should therefore provide strong constraints on Saturn's internal\nstructure. Furthermore, we identify multiple waves with the same number of arms\nand very similar pattern speeds, indicating that multiple m=3 and m=2 sectoral\n(l=m) modes may exist within the planet.",

For the space environment SEPs are\namong the biggest hazards, particularly for spacecraft and human exploration of\nthe solar system. Unfortunately our current understanding of the acceleration\nand transport of SEPs is weak. With the increasing onset of the space age it is\nvitally important that we increase our knowledge of the physical mechanisms\nrelated to SEPs. In this direction, the SEPServer project aims at building an\non-line server that will provide the space research community with SEP data and\nrelated observations of solar electromagnetic emission. INTEGRAL/SPI acquires\nobservations from many X-ray/\\gamma-ray flares associated with SEP events. To\nmake this data accessible for SEP studies we have undertaken a major effort to\nspecify the solar observing conditionS of INTEGRAL through Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of its BGO-detector response for several flares associated with\nselected SEP events.",

In both former\nyears, Phaethon brightened unexpectedly by ~1 magnitude at large phase angles,\ninconsistent with the ~1 magnitude of steady fading expected from a discrete,\nmacroscopic body over the same phase angle range. With a perihelion distance of\n0.14 AU and surface temperatures up to ~1000 K, a thermal origin of this\nanomalous brightening is strongly suspected. However, simple thermal emission\nfrom Phaethon is too weak, by a factor >1000, to explain the brightening.\nNeither can ice survive on this body, ruling out comet-like sublimation. Our\npreferred explanation is that brightening occurs as a result of dust produced\nand ejected from Phaethon, perhaps by thermal fracture and/or thermal\ndecomposition of surface minerals when near perihelion. A contribution from\nprompt emission by oxygen released by desiccation of surface minerals cannot be\nexcluded. We infer an ejected mass of order 4x10^8 a_mm kg per outburst, where\na_mm is the mean dust radius in millimeters. For plausible dust radii, this\nmass is small compared to the estimated mass of Phaethon (~2x10^14 kg) and to\nthe mass of the Geminid stream (10^12 kg to 10^13 kg) with which Phaethon is\ndynamically associated. Perihelion mass-loss events like those observed in 2009\nand 2012 contribute to, but do not necessarily account for the Geminids stream\nmass.",

In this paper, a\nsimulated annealing algorithm is used to numerically model the exploration of\nthe local interstellar neighborhood (i.e. on the order of ten parsecs of the\nSolar System) by a fixed number of probes launched from the Solar System; these\nsimulations use the observed masses, positions and spectral classes of targeted\nstars. Each probe visits a pre-determined list of target systems, maintains a\nconstant cruise speed, and only changes direction from gravitational deflection\nat each target. From these simulations, it is examined how varying design\nchoices -- differing the maximum cruise speed, number of probes launched,\nnumber of target stars to be explored, and probability of avoiding catastrophic\nsystem failure per parsec -- change the completion time of the exploration\nprogram and the expected number of stars successfully visited. In addition, it\nis shown that improving this success probability per parsec has diminishing\nreturns beyond a certain point. Future improvements to the model and possible\nimplications are discussed.",

The\nfrequencies of these waves in the solar wind frame are much smaller than the\nproton gyro-frequency. After the wave vector ${\\bf k}$ is determined at each\nspacecraft frequency $f_{sc}$, wave polarization property is analyzed in the\nplane perpendicular to ${\\bf k}$.

Anomalous cosmic rays, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays\npresent strong intensity fluctuations. Several works suggested that the\nfluctuations might be attributed to spatial variations within the heliosheath.\nAdditionally, the variability of the solar wind in this region is caused by\ndifferent temporal events that occur near the Sun and propagate to the outer\nheliosphere. To understand the spatial and temporal effects in the heliosheath,\nit is important to study these effects separately. In this work we explore the\nrole of shocks as one type of temporal effects in the dynamics of the\nheliosheath. Although currently plasma in the heliosheath is dominated by solar\nminima conditions, with increasing solar cycle shocks associated with\ntransients will play an important role. We used a 3D MHD multi-fluid model of\nthe interaction between the solar wind and the local interstellar medium to\nstudy the propagation of a pair of forward-reverse shocks in the supersonic\nsolar wind, interaction with the TS, and propagation to the heliosheath. We\nfound that in the supersonic solar wind the interaction region between the\nshocks expands, the shocks weaken and decelerate. The fluctuation amplitudes of\nthe plasma parameters vary with heliocentric distance. The interaction of the\npair of shocks with the TS creates a variety of new waves and discontinuities\nin the heliosheath, which produce a highly variable solar wind flow. The\ncollision of the forward shock with the heliopause causes a reflection of fast\nmagnetosonic waves inside the heliosheath.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signal\nresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the Planck High\nFrequency Instrument (HFI). These interactions fall into two categories,\nheating the 0.1 K bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.\nGlitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into a\nthree families. The glitch shape for each family has been characterized\nempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. The\nspectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and a\ncorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. Most of the\ndetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the Si die frame\nsupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. At HFI, the particle flux is\n~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on the\nspacecraft with an energy >39 MeV, leading to a rate of typically one event per\nsecond and per detector. Different categories of glitches have different\nsignature in timestreams. Two of the glitch types have a low amplitude\ncomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. This component produces an excess\nnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. We have used a glitch\ndetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of population\ntemplates. The application of this novel glitch removal method removes excess\nnoise from glitches. Using realistic simulations, we find this method does not\nintroduce signal bias.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the data\nacquired by the Low Frequency Instrument on Planck. Our calibration is based on\na combination of the Orbital Dipole plus the Solar Dipole, caused respectively\nby the motion of the Planck spacecraft with respect to the Sun and by motion of\nthe Solar System with respect to the CMB rest frame. The latter provides a\nsignal of a few mK with the same spectrum as the CMB anisotropies and is\nvisible throughout the mission. In this data release we rely on the\ncharacterization of the Solar Dipole as measured by WMAP. We also present\npreliminary results (at 44GHz only) on the study of the Orbital Dipole, which\nagree with the WMAP value of the Solar System speed within our uncertainties.\nWe compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,\nin order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. Since non-idealities\nin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented a\nfast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimating\nthe signal generated by the dipole. Moreover, in order to further reduce the\nimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variations\nin the calibration constant of the 30GHz radiometers (the ones with the largest\nsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. We have estimated the\ncalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assess\nthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument and\nin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistency\nchecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of Jupiter. Calibration\nerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 GHz,\nand 0.8% at 30 GHz. (Abriged.)",

In particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,\nstarting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,\ncalibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. Data are continuously\ncalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. Sky\nsignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based on\nsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. Noise properties\nare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,\nusing a generalized least square map-making algorithm. A destriping code\n(Madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information into\nsky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. Noise covariance\nmatrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on LFI and Planck\nproducts, are also produced. Main beams are estimated down to the -20 dB level\nusing Jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration of\nthe focal plane.",

Due to the unique configuration of the STEREO s/c orbits we are\nable to investigate spatial variations in the intensity of the corotating ions\non time scales of less than one solar rotation. The observations reveal that\nthe occurrence of the strong CIR events was the most frequent at the beginning\nof the period. The inclination of the heliospheric current sheet relative to\nthe heliographic equator (the tilt angle) was quite high in the first stage of\nthe mission and gradually flattened with the time, followed by a decrease in\nthe CIR activity. By examining the differences between measurements on the two\nSTEREO s/c we discuss how the changes in the position of the s/c relative to\nthe CIRs affect the energetic particle observations. We combine STEREO\nobservations with observations from the ULEIS instrument on the ACE s/c and\nargue that the main factor which controls the differences in the ion\nintensities is the latitudinal separation between the two STEREO s/c relative\nto the tilted CIRs. The position of the s/c is less important when the tilt\nangle is high. In this case we found that the CIR ion intensity positively\ncorrelates with the tilt angle.",

By considering an\natmospheric composition close to that of today's Pluto and a broad range of\nsurface pressures, we find that Ar, Kr and Xe can be efficiently trapped in\nclathrates if they formed at the surface, in a way similar to what has been\nproposed for Titan. The formation on Pluto of clathrates rich in noble gases\ncould then induce a strong decrease in their atmospheric abundances relative to\ntheir initial values. A clathrate thickness of order of a few centimeters\nglobally averaged on the planet is enough to trap all Ar, Kr and Xe if these\nnoble gases were in protosolar proportions in Pluto's early atmosphere. Because\natmospheric escape over an extended period of time (millions of years) should\nlead to a noble gas abundance that either remains constant or increases with\ntime, we find that a potential depletion of Ar, Kr and Xe in the atmosphere\nwould best be explained by their trapping in clathrates. A key observational\ntest is the measurement of Ar since the Alice UV spectrometer aboard the New\nHorizons spacecraft will be sensitive enough to detect its abundance $\\sim$10\ntimes smaller than in the case considered here.",

Three N-bearing species are firmly\ndetected: HCN, HC3N and C2N2, and their vertical and latitudinal distributions\nhave been mapped. In addition, ices of HC3N and possibly C4N2 are also seen in\nthe far-infrared spectrum at high latitudes during the northern winter. The\nHC(15)N isotopologue has been measured, permitting the inference of the 14N/15N\nratio in this species, which differs markedly (lower) than in the bulk nitrogen\nreservoir (N2). We also describe the search in the CIRS spectrum, and inferred\nupper limits, for NH3 and CH3CN. CIRS is now observing seasonal transition on\nTitan and the gas abundance distributions are changing accordingly, acting as\ntracers of the changing atmospheric circulation. The prospects for further CIRS\nscience in the remaining five years of the Cassini mission are discussed.",

The addition of an\naccelerometer on board is a major step toward this goal because this instrument\nmeasures the non-gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft. It must be able\nto perform measurements at low frequencies with no bias to provide an\nadditional observable of interest.\nSince electrostatic accelerometers suffer a bias, a technological upgrade has\nbeen proposed by Onera. It consists in adding to an electrostatic accelerometer\na rotating platform which allows modulating the signal of interest and\nretrieving it without bias after post-processing. Using this principle, a\nmeasurement method and a post-processing method have been developed. The\nobjective of this article is to validate these methods experimentally. To do\nso, a horizontally controlled pendulum was used to apply a known signal to an\naccelerometer mounted on a rotating platform. The processing of the\nexperimental data demonstrates the ability to make acceleration measurements\nwith no bias. In addition, the experimental precision on the unbiased\nacceleration obtained after post-processing corresponds to the precision\npredicted theoretically.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  New measurements using radio and plasma-wave instruments in interplanetary\nspace have shown that nanometer-scale dust, or nanodust, is a significant\ncontributor to the total mass in interplanetary space. Better measurements of\nnanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent to which\nit interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a\nspacecraft, it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the\nphotoelectron currents. This leads to a voltage pulse between the spacecraft\nbody and the antenna. Nanodust has a high charge/mass ratio, and therefore can\nbe accelerated by the interplanetary magnetic field to speeds up to the speed\nof the solar wind: significantly faster than the Keplerian orbital speeds of\nheavier dust. The amplitude of the signal induced by a dust grain grows much\nmore strongly with speed than with mass of the dust particle. As a result,\nnanodust can produce a strong signal, despite their low mass. The WAVES\ninstruments on the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft have\nobserved interplanetary nanodust particles since shortly after their launch in\n2006. After describing a new and improved analysis of the last five years of\nSTEREO/WAVES Low Frequency Receiver data, a statistical survey of the nanodust\ncharacteristics, namely the rise time of the pulse voltage and the flux of\nnanodust, is presented. Agreement with previous measurements and interplanetary\ndust models is shown. The temporal variations of the nanodust flux are also\ndiscussed.",

Using adaptive\noptics at the W.M. Keck Observatory, we have obtained spatially resolved\nspectra of most of the disk of Europa at a spectral resolution ~40 times higher\nthan seen by the Galileo spacecraft. These spectra show a previously undetected\ndistinct signature of magnesium sulfate salts on Europa, but the magnesium\nsulfate is confined to the trailing hemisphere and spatially correlated with\nthe presence of radiation products like sulfuric acid and SO2. On the leading,\nless irradiated, hemisphere, our observations rule out the presence of many of\nthe proposed sulfate salts, but do show the presence of distorted water ice\nbands. Based on the association of the potential MgSO4, detection on the\ntrailing side with other radiation products, we conclude that MgSO4 is also a\nradiation product, rather than a constituent of a Europa ocean brine. Based on\nocean chemistry models, we hypothesize that, prior to irradiation, magnesium is\nprimarily in the form of MgCl2, and we predict that NaCl and KCl are even more\nabundant, and, in fact, dominate the non-ice component of the leading\nhemisphere. We propose observational tests of this new hypothesis.",

The semi-major axis a and the perijove \\omega\\ of Juno\nare expected to be shifted by \\Delta a =700-900 m and \\Delta\\omega = 50-60\nmilliarcseconds, respectively, over 1-2 yr. A numerical analysis shows also\nthat the expected J2c^-2 range-rate signal for Juno should be as large as 280\nmicrons per second during a typical 6 h pass at its closest approach.\nIndependent analyses previously performed by other researchers about the\nmeasurability of the Lense-Thirring effect showed that the radio science\napparatus of Juno should reach an accuracy in Doppler range-rate measurements\nof 1-5 microns per second over such passes. The range-rate signature of the\nclassical even zonal perturbations is different from the 1PN one. Thus, further\ninvestigations, based on covariance analyses of simulated Doppler data and\ndedicated parameters estimation, are worth of further consideration. It turns\nout that the J2 c^-2 effects cannot be responsible of the flyby anomaly in the\ngravitational field of the Earth.

We show here that the new detector lightcurves in the 3 to 160 keV\nrange differ from the ones obtained in 2006. Instead of the expected modulation\ninduced by the passage of the Earth through the field of view of the JEM-X,\nIBIS/ISGRI and SPI instruments, we record unrelated variability on shorter\ntimescales. We discuss the differences obtained with the datasets of 2006 and\n2012 in view of the changes in pointing direction, spacecraft orbit and solar\ncycle phase. We conclude that the Earth occultation signal in 2012 is likely\nblended by radioactive decay resulting from the activation of the spacecraft\nwhen crossing the proton radiation belt at perigee passage. The observed\nvariability, on the other hand, results most likely from the current solar\nmaximum. In addition to a variable particle environment from inhomogeneities of\nthe solar wind, we also find evidence for hard X-ray auroral emission. While\nthe former can be traced by SPI/ACS counts, the latter - by enhancing\nunpredictably the Earth emission - is a major disturbance for measuring the\ndiffuse X-ray background through occultation by the Earth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Most of the visible matter in the Universe is ionized, so that cosmic\nmagnetic fields are quite easy to generate and due to the lack of magnetic\nmonopoles hard to destroy. Magnetic fields have been measured in or around\npractically all celestial objects, either by in-situ measurements of\nspacecrafts or by the electromagnetic radiation of embedded cosmic rays, gas,\nor dust. The Earth, the Sun, solar planets, stars, pulsars, the Milky Way,\nnearby galaxies, more distant (radio) galaxies, quasars, and even intergalactic\nspace in clusters of galaxies have significant magnetic fields, and even larger\nvolumes of the Universe may be permeated by 'dark' magnetic fields. Information\non cosmic magnetic fields has increased enormously as the result of the rapid\ndevelopment of observational methods, especially in radio astronomy. In the\nMilky Way, a wealth of magnetic phenomena was discovered that are only partly\nrelated to objects visible in other spectral ranges. The large-scale structure\nof the Milky Way's magnetic field is still under debate. The available data for\nexternal galaxies can well be explained by field amplification and ordering via\nthe dynamo mechanism. The measured field strengths and the similarity of field\npatterns and flow patterns of the diffuse ionized gas give strong indication\nthat galactic magnetic fields are dynamically important. They may affect the\nformation of spiral arms, outflows, and the general evolution of galaxies. In\nspite of our increasing knowledge on magnetic fields, many important questions\non the origin and evolution of magnetic fields, like their first occurrence in\nyoung galaxies, or the existence of large-scale intergalactic fields remained\nunanswered. 'Cosmic magnetism' is a key science project for several existing\nand planned radio telescopes, like LOFAR and the SKA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Galactic HI emission profiles in an area where several large-scale filaments\nat velocities ranging from -46 km/s to 0 km/s overlap were decomposed into\nGaussian components. Eighteen families of components defined by similarities of\ncenter velocity and line width were identified and related to small-scale\nstructure in the high-frequency continuum emission observed by the WMAP\nspacecraft, as evidenced in the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map of\nHinshaw et al.

When the center velocities of the Gaussian families,\nwhich summarize the properties of all the HI along the lines-of-sight in a\ngiven area, are used to focus on HI channel maps the phenomenon of close\nassociations between HI and ILC peaks reported in previous papers is\ndramatically highlighted. Of particular interest, each of two pairs of HI peaks\nstraddles a continuum peak. The previously hypothesized model for producing the\ncontinuum radiation (Verschuur, 2010) involving free-free emission from\nelectrons is re-examined in the light of the new data. By choosing reasonable\nvalues for the parameters required to evaluate the model, the distance for\nassociated HI-ILC features is of order 30 to 100 pc. No associated H-alpha\nradiation is expected because the electrons involved exist throughout the Milky\nWay. The mechanism for clumping and separation of neutrals and electrons needs\nto be explored.",

The\nfrequency of these waves, measured in the MGS reference frame (SC), is close to\nthe local proton cyclotron frequency. Minimum variance analysis (MVA) shows\nthat these 'proton cyclotron frequency' waves (PCWs) are characterized - in the\nSC frame - by a left-hand, elliptical polarization and propagate almost\nparallel to the background magnetic field. They also have a small degree of\ncompressibility and an amplitude that decreases with the increase of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF) cone angle and radial distance from the\nplanet. The latter result supports the idea that the source of these waves is\nMars. In addition, we find that these waves are not associated with the\nforeshock . Empirical evidence and theoretical approaches suggest that most of\nthese observations correspond to the ion-ion right hand (RH) mode originating\nfrom the pick-up of ionized exospheric hydrogen. The left-hand (LH) mode might\nbe present in cases where the IMF cone angle is high. PCWs occur in 62% of the\ntime during SPO1 subphase, whereas occurrence drops to 8% during SPO2. Also,\nSPO1 PCWs preserve their characteristics for longer time periods and have\ngreater degree of polarization and coherence than those in SPO2. We discuss\nthese results in the context of possible changes in the pick-up conditions from\nSPO1 to SPO2, or steady, spatial inhomogeneities in the wave distribution. The\nlack of influence from the Solar Wind's convective electric field upon the\nlocation of PCWs indicates that there is no clear relation between the spatial\ndistribution of PCWs and that of pick-up ions.",

We present new visible and near-infrared spectra to\ndemonstrate that thermally altered carbonaceous chondrites are plausible\ncompositional analogs, however this is a tentative association due to a lack of\nany prominent absorption features in our data. We have also conducted a series\nof high signal-to-noise visible-wavelength observations to investigate the\nreported surface heterogeneity. Our time series of visible spectra do not show\nevidence for variability at a precision level of a few percent. This result\nsuggests two most likely possibilities. One, that the surface of 1999 JU3 is\nhomogenous and that unaccounted for systematic effects are causing spectral\nvariation across epochs. Or two, that the surface of 1999 JU3 is regionally\nheterogenous, in which case existing shape models suggest that any\nheterogeneity must be limited to terrains smaller than approximately 5% of the\ntotal surface area. These new observations represent the last opportunity\nbefore both the launch and return of the Hayabusa II spacecraft to perform\nground-based characterization of this asteroid. Ultimately, these predictions\nfor composition and surface properties will be tested upon completion of the\nmission.",

For this purpose we use magnetic field\nmeasurements made by the Helios-2 spacecraft at three positions between 0.29\nand 0.9 AU. To derive the power spectral density (PSD) in $(k_\\parallel,\nk_\\bot)$-space based on single-satellite measurements is a challenging task not\nyet accomplished previously. Here we derive the spectrum\n$\\rm{PSD}_{\\rm{2D}}$($\\rm{k}_\\parallel$, $\\rm{k}_\\bot$) from the spatial\ncorrelation function $\\rm{CF}_{\\rm{2D}}(r_\\parallel, r_\\bot)$ by a\ntransformation according to the projection-slice theorem. We find the so\nconstructed PSDs to be distributed in k-space mainly along a ridge that is more\ninclined toward the $\\rm{k}_\\bot$ than $\\rm{k}_\\parallel$ axis, a new result\nwhich probably indicates preferential cascading of turbulent energy along the\n$\\rm{k}_\\bot$ direction. Furthermore, this ridge of the distribution is found\nto gradually get closer to the $\\rm{k}_\\bot$ axis, as the outer scale length of\nthe turbulence becomes larger while the solar wind flows further away from the\nSun. In the vicinity of the $\\rm{k}_\\parallel$ axis, there appears a minor\nspectral component that probably corresponds to quasi-parallel Alfv\u00e9nic\nfluctuations. Their relative contribution to the total spectral density tends\nto decrease with radial distance. These findings suggest that solar wind\nturbulence undergoes an anisotropic cascade transporting most of its magnetic\nenergy towards larger $\\rm{k}_\\bot$, and that the anisotropy in the inertial\nrange is radially developing further at scales that are relatively far from the\never increasing outer scale.",

For two months preceding the spacecraft's closest\napproach, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) onboard regularly imaged the\natmosphere. We created time-lapse movies from this period in order to analyze\nthe dynamics of equatorial hot spots and their interactions with adjacent\nlatitudes. Hot spots are quasi-stable, rectangular dark areas on\nvisible-wavelength images, with defined eastern edges that sharply contrast\nwith surrounding clouds, but diffuse western edges serving as nebulous\nboundaries with adjacent equatorial plumes. Hot spots exhibit significant\nvariations in size and shape over timescales of days and weeks. Some of these\nchanges correspond with passing vortex systems from adjacent latitudes\ninteracting with hot spots. Strong anticyclonic gyres present to the south and\nsoutheast of the dark areas appear to circulate into hot spots. Impressive,\nbright white plumes occupy spaces in between hot spots. Compact cirrus-like\n'scooter' clouds flow rapidly through the plumes before disappearing within the\ndark areas. These clouds travel at 150-200 m/s, much faster than the 100 m/s\nhot spot and plume drift speed. This raises the possibility that the scooter\nclouds may be more illustrative of the actual jet stream speed at these\nlatitudes. Most previously published zonal wind profiles represent the drift\nspeed of the hot spots at their latitude from pattern matching of the entire\nlongitudinal image strip. If a downward branch of an equatorially-trapped\nRossby waves controls the overall appearance of hot spots, however, the\nwestward phase velocity of the wave leads to underestimates of the true jet\nstream speed.",

Although reflected light from such a planet encodes\ninformation about its surface, it has not been shown how to establish surface\ncharacteristics of a planet without assuming known surfaces to begin with. We\npresent a re-analysis of disk-integrated, time-resolved, multiband photometry\nof Earth obtained by the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of\nOpportunity. We extract reflectance spectra of clouds, ocean and land without a\npriori knowledge of the numbers or colors of these surfaces. We show that the\ninverse problem of extracting surface spectra from such data is a novel and\nextreme instance of spectral unmixing, a well-studied problem in remote\nsensing. Principal component analysis is used to determine an appropriate\nnumber of model surfaces with which to interpret the data. Shrink-wrapping a\nsimplex to the color excursions of the planet yields a conservative estimate of\nthe planet's endmember spectra. The resulting surface maps are unphysical,\nhowever, requiring negative or larger-than-unity surface coverage at certain\nlocations. Our \"rotational unmixing\" supersedes the endmember analysis by\nsimultaneously solving for the surface spectra and their geographical\ndistributions on the planet, under the assumption of diffuse reflection and\nknown viewing geometry. We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to determine best-fit\nparameters and their uncertainties. The resulting albedo spectra are similar to\nclouds, ocean and land seen through a Rayleigh-scattering atmosphere.

This profile reflects the \"true\"\napex kinematics since it is not affected by scattering or projection effects.\nIn this way it is possible to determine the accuracy of the method for\nrevealing ICME propagation directions and kinematics. We found that the\ndirection obtained by the constrained Harmonic Mean method is not very\nsensitive to the separation angle (30\u00b0 sep: \\phi = W7; 60\u00b0 sep: \\phi\n= W12; 90\u00b0 sep: \\phi = W15; true dir.: E0/W0). For all three cases the\nderived kinematics are in a relatively good agreement with the real kinematics.\nThe best consistency is obtained for the 30\u00b0 case, while with growing\nseparation angle the ICME speed at 1 AU is increasingly overestimated (30\u00b0\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~-50 km/s, 60\u00b0 sep: \\Delta V_arr ~+75 km/s, 90\u00b0\nsep: \\Delta V_arr ~+125 km/s). Especially for future L4/L5 missions the\n60\u00b0 separation case is highly interesting in order to improve space\nweather forecasts.",

Our\ntechnique yields a high-density, regular grid of wind velocity vectors that is\nadvantageous over a limited number of scattered wind vectors that result from\nmanual cloud tracking. The high-velocity collar of the GRS is clearly seen from\nour velocity vector map, and highest wind velocities are measured to be around\n170 m/s. The high resolution of the mosaics have also enabled us to map\nturbulent eddies inside the chaotic central region of the GRS, similar to those\nmapped by Sada et al. (1996) and Vasavada et al. (1998). Using the wind\nvelocity measurements, we computed particle trajectories around the GRS as well\nas maps of relative and absolute vorticities. We have discovered a narrow ring\nof cyclonic vorticity that surrounds the main anti-cyclonic high-velocity\ncollar. This narrow ring appears to correspond to a ring surrounding the GRS\nthat is bright in 5-microns (Terrile and Beebe 1979). It appears that this\ncyclonic ring is not a transient feature of the GRS, as we have discovered it\nin a re-analysis of Galileo data taken in 1996 first analyzed by Vasavada et\nal. (1998). We also calculate how absolute vorticity changes as a function of\nlatitude along a trajectory around the GRS and compare these measurements to\nsimilar ones performed by Dowling and Ingersoll (1988) using Voyager data. We\nshow no dramatic evolution in the structure of the GRS since the Voyager era\nexcept for additional evidence for a counterrotating GRS core, an increase in\nvelocity in the main velocity collar, and an overall decrease in the length of\nthe GRS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Sunspots are regions of decreased brightness on the visible surface of the\nSun (photosphere) that are associated with strong magnetic fields. They have\nbeen found to be locations associated with solar flares, which occur when\nenergy stored in sunspot magnetic fields is suddenly released. The processes\ninvolved in flaring and the link between sunspot magnetic fields and flares is\nstill not fully understood, and this thesis aims to gain a better understanding\nof these topics. The magnetic field evolution of a number of sunspot regions is\nexamined using high spatial resolution data from the Hinode spacecraft. The\nresearch presented in this thesis gives insight into both photospheric and\ncoronal magnetic field evolution of flaring regions. Significant increases in\nvertical field strength, current density, and field inclination angle towards\nthe vertical are observed in the photosphere just hours before a flare occurs,\nwhich is on much shorter timescales than previously studied. First observations\nof spatial changes in field inclination across a magnetic neutral line\n(generally believed to be a typical source region of flares) are also\ndiscovered. 3D magnetic field extrapolation methods are used to study the\ncoronal magnetic field, using the photospheric magnetic field data as a\nboundary condition. Magnetic energy and free magnetic energy are observed to\nincrease significantly a few hours before a flare, and decrease afterwards,\nwhich is a similar trend to the photospheric field parameter changes observed.\nEvidence of partial Taylor relaxation is also detected after a flare, as\npredicted by several previous studies. The results outlined in this thesis show\nthat this particular field of research is vital in furthering our understanding\nof the magnetic nature of sunspots and its link to flare processes.",

Model\nfitting to these data allows us to improve measurements of the hot-Jupiter\nexoplanet WASP-2b and its orbital parameters by a factor of ~2 over prior\nstudies; we do not find evidence for transit depth variations. We do find\nreduced chi^2 values greater than 1.0 in the observed minus computed transit\ntimes. A sinusoidal fit to the residuals yields a timing semi-amplitude of 32\nseconds and a period of 389 days. However, random rearrangements of the data\nprovide similar quality fits, and we cannot with certainty ascribe the timing\nvariations to mutual exoplanet interactions. This inconclusive result is\nconsistent with the lack of incontrovertible transit timing variations (TTVs)\nobserved in other hot-Jupiter systems. This outcome emphasizes that unique\nrecognition of TTVs requires dense sampling of the libration cycle (e.g.\ncontinuous observations from space-based platforms). However, even in systems\nobserved with the Kepler spacecraft, there is a noted lack of transiting\ncompanions and TTVs in hot-Jupiter systems. This result is more meaningful, and\nindicates that hot-Jupiter systems, while they are easily observable from the\nground, do not appear to be currently configured in a manner favorable to the\ndetection of TTVs. The future of ground-based TTV studies may reside in\nresolving secular trends, and/or implementation at extreme quality observing\nsites to minimize atmospheric red noise.",

Traditional scenarios involve a\nrock-ice planetoid with mX = 0.7mE at some 100 - 200 au, or a Jovian body with\nmX = 5mJ at about 10,000 - 20,000 au; as a result of our preliminary\nsensitivity analysis, they should be detectable by New Horizons since they\nwould impact its range at a km level or so over a time span six years long.\nConversely, range residuals statistically compatible with zero having an\namplitude of 10 m would imply that PX, if it exists, could not be located at\nless than about 4,500 au (mX = 0.7mE) or 60,000 au (mX = 5mJ), thus making a\ndirect detection quite demanding with the present-day technologies. As a\nconsequence, it would be appropriate to rename such a remote body as Telisto.\nAlso fundamental physics would benefit from this analysis since certain subtle\neffects predicted by MOND for the deep Newtonian regions of our Solar System\nare just equivalent to those of a distant pointlike mass.",

For most of the flyby period, the entire Io torus fit within the UVIS\nfield-of-view, enabling the measurement of the total power radiated from the\ntorus in the extreme ultraviolet. A typical value for the total power radiated\nin the wavelength range of 580\u00c5-1181\u00c5 is 1.7x10^12 W, with observed\nvariations of up to 25%. Several brightening events were observed. These events\nlasted for roughly 20 hours, during which time the emitted power increased\nrapidly by ~20% before slowly returning to the pre-event level. Observed\nvariations in the relative intensities of torus spectral features provide\nstrong evidence for compositional changes in the torus plasma with time.\nSpatial profiles of the EUV emission show no evidence for a sharply peaked\n\"ribbon\" feature. The ratio of the brightness of the dusk ansa to the\nbrightness of the dawn ansa is observed to be highly variable, with an average\nvalue of 1.30.

The Io torus has not been\npreviously observed at this local time. The UVIS data consist of 2-D spectrally\ndispersed images of the Io plasma torus in the wavelength range of\n561\u00c5-1912\u00c5. We developed a spectral emissions model that incorporates\nthe latest atomic physics data contained in the CHIANTI database in order to\nderive the composition of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance.\nElectron temperatures derived from the UVIS torus spectra are generally less\nthan those observed during the Voyager era. We find the torus ion composition\nderived from the UVIS spectra to be significantly different from the\ncomposition during the Voyager era. Notably, the torus contains substantially\nless oxygen, with a total oxygen-to-sulfur ion ratio of 0.9. The average ion\ncharge state has increased to 1.7. We detect S V in the Io torus at the\n3{\\sigma} level. S V has a mixing ratio of 0.5%. The spectral emission model\nused in can approximate the effects of a non-thermal distribution of electrons.\nThe ion composition derived using a kappa distribution of electrons is\nidentical to that derived using a Maxwellian electron distribution; however,\nthe kappa distribution model requires a higher electron column density to match\nthe observed brightness of the spectra. The derived value of the kappa\nparameter decreases with radial distance and is consistent with the value of\n{\\kappa}=2.4 at 8 RJ derived by the Ulysses URAP instrument (Meyer-Vernet et\nal., 1995). The observed radial profile of electron column density is\nconsistent with a flux tube content, NL^2, that is proportional to r^-2.",

For any\ngiven burst observed by the GBM and one other distant spacecraft, triangulation\ngives an annulus of possible arrival directions whose half-width varies between\nabout 0.4' and 32 degrees, depending on the intensity, time history, and\narrival direction of the burst, as well as the distance between the spacecraft.\nWe find that the IPN localizations intersect the 1 sigma GBM error circles in\nonly 52% of the cases, if no systematic uncertainty is assumed for the latter.\nIf a 6 degree systematic uncertainty is assumed and added in quadrature, the\ntwo localization samples agree about 87% of the time, as would be expected. If\nwe then multiply the resulting error radii by a factor of 3, the two samples\nagree in slightly over 98% of the cases, providing a good estimate of the GBM 3\nsigma error radius. The IPN 3 sigma error boxes have areas between about 1\nsquare arcminute and 110 square degrees, and are, on the average, a factor of\n180 smaller than the corresponding GBM localizations. We identify two bursts in\nthe IPN/GBM sample that did not appear in the GBM catalog. In one case, the GBM\ntriggered on a terrestrial gamma flash, and in the other, its origin was given\nas uncertain. We also discuss the sensitivity and calibration of the IPN.",
