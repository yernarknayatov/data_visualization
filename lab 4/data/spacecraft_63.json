Each configuration compares two widely\nseparated atom interferometers run using common lasers. The effect of the\ngravitational waves on the propagating laser field produces the main effect in\nthis configuration and enables a large enhancement in the gravitational wave\nsignal while significantly suppressing many backgrounds. The use of ballistic\natoms (instead of mirrors) as inertial test masses improves systematics coming\nfrom vibrations and acceleration noise, and reduces spacecraft control\nrequirements.",

The ULYSSES spacecraft spent many\nmonths in the quiet fast solar wind above the Sun's polar coronal holes in a\nhighly ordered magnetic field. We use statistical analysis methods such as the\ngeneralized structure function (GSF) and extended self-similarity (ESS) to\nquantify the scaling of the moments of the probability density function of\nfluctuations in the magnetic field. The GSFs give power law scaling in the\n``$f^{-1}$'' range of the form $<| y(t+\\tau)-y(t)|^{m}>\\sim\\tau^{\\zeta(m)}$,\nbut ESS is required to reveal scaling in the inertial range, which is of the\nform $<| y(t+\\tau)-y(t)|^{m}>\\sim [g(\\tau)]^{\\zeta(m)}$. We find that $g(\\tau)$\nis independent of spacecraft position and\n$g(\\tau)\\sim\\tau^{-log_{10}(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\tau)}$. The ``$f^{-1}$'' scaling\nfluctuates with radial spacecraft position. This confirms that, whereas the\n``$f^{-1}$'' fluctuations are directly influenced by the corona, the inertial\nrange fluctuations are consistent with locally evolving turbulence, but with an\n``envelope'' $g(\\tau)$, which captures the formation of the quiet fast solar\nwind.",

Instead, the\nasymmetry is oriented in the direction of the Earth's motion within an assumed\nunique reference frame. With this assumption, the simulation results of the\nEarth flybys Galileo1, NEAR, Rosetta1 and Cassini hit the observed nominal\nvalues, while for the flybys Galileo2 and Messenger, which for different\nreasons are measured with uncertain anomaly values, the simulated anomalies are\nwithin plausible ranges.

It could lead to major discoveries by using demonstrated\ntechnologies. The mission proposes to perform a set of precision gravitation\nexperiments from the vicinity of Earth to the outer Solar System. Its\nscientific objectives can be summarized as follows: i) test of the gravity\nforce law in the Solar System up to and beyond the orbit of Saturn; ii) precise\ninvestigation of navigation anomalies at the fly-bys; iii) measurement of\nEddington's parameter at occultations; iv) mapping of gravity field in the\nouter solar system and study of the Kuiper belt. To this aim, the Odyssey\nmission is built up on a main spacecraft, designed to fly up to 13 AU, with the\nfollowing components: a) a high-precision accelerometer, with bias-rejection\nsystem, measuring the deviation of the trajectory from the geodesics; b)\nKa-band transponders, as for Cassini, for a precise range and Doppler\nmeasurement up to 13 AU, with additional VLBI equipment; c) optional laser\nequipment, which would allow one to improve the range and Doppler measurement.\nIn this baseline concept, the main spacecraft is designed to operate beyond the\nSaturn orbit, up to 13 AU. It experiences multiple planetary fly-bys at Earth,\nMars or Venus, and Jupiter. The cruise and fly-by phases allow the mission to\nachieve its baseline scientific objectives (i) to iii) in the above list). In\naddition to this baseline concept, the Odyssey mission proposes the release of\nthe Enigma radio-beacon at Saturn, allowing one to extend the deep space\ngravity test up to at least 50 AU, while achieving the scientific objective of\na mapping of gravity field in the outer Solar System.",

Each event analyzed in detail\nis associated with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and an IP\nshock driven by the ICME. Immediately prior to the arrival of each shock,\nelectron beams along the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and associated\nLangmuir waves are detected, implying magnetic connection to a\nquasiperpendicular shock front acceleration site. These observations are\nanalogous to those made in the terrestrial foreshock region, indicating that a\nsimilar foreshock region exists on IP shock fronts. The analogy suggests that\nthe electron acceleration process is a fast Fermi process, and this suggestion\nis borne out by loss cone features in the electron distribution functions. The\npresence of a foreshock region requires nonplanar structure on the shock front.\nUsing Wind burst mode data, the foreshock electrons are analyzed to estimate\nthe dimensions of the curved region. We present the first measurement of the\nlateral, shock-parallel scale size of IP foreshock regions. The presence of\nthese regions on IP shock fronts can explain the fine structure often seen in\nthe spectra of type II bursts.",

The uncertainty in the estimate of polarization, as computed in\nthe Fisher-matrix formalism, also worsens when moving from six to five, and\nthen to four links: this can be explained by the reduced SNR available in those\nconfigurations (except for observations shorter than three months, where five\nand six links do better than four even with the same SNR).

This signal\nhas become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains\nunexplained.\nNew Pioneer 10 and 11 radio-metric Doppler data recently became available.\nThe much extended set of Pioneer Doppler data is the primary source for new\nupcoming investigation of the anomaly. We also have almost entire records of\nflight telemetry files received from the the Pioneers. Together with original\nproject documentation and newly developed software tools, this additional\ninformation is now used to reconstruct the engineering history of both\nspacecraft. To that extent, a thermal model of the Pioneer vehicles is being\ndeveloped to study possible contribution of thermal recoil force acting on the\ntwo spacecraft. In addition, to improve the accuracy of orbital reconstruction,\nwe developed a new approach that uses actual flight telemetry data during\ntrajectory analysis of radio-metric Doppler files. The ultimate goal of these\nefforts is to investigate possible contributions of the thermal recoil force to\nthe detected anomalous acceleration.",

Current LLR\ntechnology allows us to measure distances to the Moon with a precision\napproaching 1 millimeter. As NASA pursues the vision of taking humans back to\nthe Moon, new, more precise laser ranging applications will be demanded,\nincluding continuous tracking from more sites on Earth, placing new CCR arrays\non the Moon, and possibly installing other devices such as transponders, etc.\nSuccessful achievement of this goal strongly demands further significant\nimprovement of the theoretical model of the orbital and rotational dynamics of\nthe Earth-Moon system. This model should inevitably be based on the theory of\ngeneral relativity, fully incorporate the relevant geophysical processes, lunar\nlibrations, tides, and should rely upon the most recent standards and\nrecommendations of the IAU for data analysis. This paper discusses methods and\nproblems in developing such a mathematical model. The model will take into\naccount all the classical and relativistic effects in the orbital and\nrotational motion of the Moon and Earth at the sub-centimeter level. The new\nmodel will allow us to navigate a spacecraft precisely to a location on the\nMoon. It will also greatly improve our understanding of the structure of the\nlunar interior and the nature of the physical interaction at the core-mantle\ninterface layer. The new theory and upcoming millimeter LLR will give us the\nmeans to perform one of the most precise fundamental tests of general\nrelativity in the solar system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The New Horizons mission was launched on 2006 January 19, and the spacecraft\nis heading for a flyby encounter with the Pluto system in the summer of 2015.\nThe challenges associated with sending a spacecraft to Pluto in less than 10\nyears and performing an ambitious suite of scientific investigations at such\nlarge heliocentric distances (> 32 AU) are formidable and required the\ndevelopment of lightweight, low power, and highly sensitive instruments. This\npaper provides an overview of the New Horizons science payload, which is\ncomprised of seven instruments. Alice provides spatially resolved ultraviolet\nspectroscopy. The Ralph instrument has two components: the Multicolor Visible\nImaging Camera (MVIC), which performs panchromatic and color imaging, and the\nLinear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA), which provides near-infrared\nspectroscopic mapping capabilities. The Radio Experiment (REX) is a component\nof the New Horizons telecommunications system that provides both occultation\nand radiometry capabilities. The Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI)\nprovides high sensitivity, high spatial resolution optical imaging\ncapabilities. The Solar Wind at Pluto (SWAP) instrument measures the density\nand speed of solar wind particles. The Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer\nScience Investigation (PEPSSI) measures energetic protons and CNO ions. The\nVenetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VB-SDC) is used to record dust particle\nimpacts during the cruise phases of the mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  To understand the physical mechanisms for activity and heating in the solar\natmosphere, the magnetic coupling from the photosphere to the corona is an\nimportant piece of information from the Hinode observations, and therefore\nprecise positional alignment is required among the data acquired by different\ntelescopes. The Hinode spacecraft and its onboard telescopes were developed to\nallow us to investigate magnetic coupling with co-alignment accuracy better\nthan 1 arcsec. Using the Mercury transit observed on 8 November 2006 and\nco-alignment measurements regularly performed on a weekly basis, we have\ndetermined the information necessary for precise image co-alignment and have\nconfirmed that co-alignment better than 1 arcsec can be realized between Solar\nOptical Telescope (SOT) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) with our baseline\nco-alignment method. This paper presents results from the calibration for\nprecise co-alignment of CCD images from SOT and XRT.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A relativistic theory is proposed to explain the anomalous accelerations of\nPioneer 10/11, Galileo and Ulysses spacecrafts. The theory points out at the\nlimitations of the weak field approximation and proposes a drift in the proper\ntime of the spacecraft outside the framework of general relativity. The theory\nyields a very accurate and precise value for the anomalous acceleration. In\nthis theory the proper time of a body is associated with the gravitational\nfrequency shift of the constituent fundamental particles of the body. The\nfrequency shift changes the energy level of the body which gets reflected in\nits relativistic mass and therefore in its motion. This change in energy level\ncauses the time like geodesics to deviate from that of the standard theoretical\nmodels. We introduce proper time in the line element of a metric theory\naccording to a fixed set of rules laid down by general relativity for\nintroducing deviation in the flat Minkowski metric. The frequency shift for\nbodies of different composition traversing different trajectories however, is\nnot the same and this gets reflected in its motion as an unmodeled anomalous\neffect. This association of proper time with the gravitational frequency shift\nof the body requires the flat Minkowski metric to deviate in different ways for\ndifferent two body systems. The solution to Pioneer anomaly given here yields\nanomalous acceleration within the limits of observational accuracy.\nGravitational redshift of light, bending of light and perihelic precession of\nplanets are within the permissible limits. The theory shows that Einstein's\nfield equations do provide some clue to the Pioneer anomaly but the solution is\nnot very accurate. The theory can also explain the rotation curves of the\nspiral galaxies.",

We focus on the evolution of\nphotospheric magnetic fields in this active region, and magnetic field\nproperties at the site of the X3.4 class flare, using a time series of vector\nfield maps with high spatial resolution. The X3.4 class flare occurred on 2006\nDecember 13 at the apparent collision site between the large, opposite polarity\numbrae. Elongated magnetic structures with alternatingly positive and negative\npolarities resulting from flux emergence appeared one day before the flare in\nthe collision site penumbra. Subsequently, the polarity inversion line at the\ncollision site became very complicated. The number of bright loops in Ca II H\nincreased during the formation of these elongated magnetic structures. The\nflare ribbons and bright loops evolved along the polarity inversion line and\none footpoint of the bright loop was located in a region having a large\ndeparture of field azimuth angle with respect to its surroundings. The SOT\nobservations with high spatial resolution and high polarization precision\nreveal temporal change in fine structure of magnetic fields at the flare site:\nsome parts of the complicated polarity inversion line then disappeared, and in\nthose regions the azimuth angle of photospheric magnetic field changed by about\n90 degrees, becoming more spatially uniform within the collision site.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  IRAC excels at detecting distant objects. Due to a combination of the shapes\nof the spectral energy distributions of galaxies and the low background\nachieved from space, IRAC reaches greater depth in comparable exposure time at\n3.6 and 4.5 micron than any ground- or space-based facility currently can at\n2.2 micron. Furthermore, the longer wavelengths probed by IRAC enable studies\nof the rest-frame optical and near-infrared light of galaxies and AGN to much\nhigher redshift than is possible from the ground. This white paper explores the\nmerits of different survey strategies for studying the distant universe during\nthe warm mission. A three-tiered approach serves a wide range of science goals\nand uses the spacecraft effectively: 1) an ultra-deep survey of ~0.04 square\ndegrees to a depth of ~250 hrs (in conjunction with an HST/WFC3 program), to\nstudy the Universe at 7<z<14; 2) a survey of ~2 square degrees to the GOODS\ndepth of 20 hrs, to identify luminous galaxies at z>6 and characterize the\nrelation between the build-up of dark matter halos and their constituent\ngalaxies at 2<z<6, and 3) a 500 square degree survey to the SWIRE depth of 120\ns, to systematically study large scale structure at 1<z<2 and characterize high\nredshift AGN. One or more of these programs could conceivably be implemented by\nthe SSC, following the example of the Hubble Deep Field campaigns. As\npriorities in this field continuously shift it is also crucial that a fraction\nof the exposure time remains unassigned, thus enabling science that will\nreflect the frontiers of 2010 and beyond rather than those of 2007.",

As focusing instrument,\nGRI will have an angular resolution of better than 30 arcsec within a field of\nview of roughly 5 arcmin - an unprecedented achievement in the gamma-ray\ndomain.

The breaks in the X-ray light curves that do exist tend to be\nshallower and occur earlier than the breaks previously observed in optical\nlight curves, yielding a Eg distribution that is far lower than the pre-Swift\ndistribution. If these early X-ray breaks are not due to jet effects, then a\nsmall but significant fraction of our sample have lower limits to their\ncollimation corrected energy that place them well above the pre-Swift Eg\ndistribution. Either scenario would necessitate a much wider post-Swift Eg\ndistribution for long cosmological GRBs compared to the narrow standard energy\ndeduced from pre-Swift observations. We note that almost all of the pre-Swift\nEg estimates come from jet breaks detected in the optical whereas our sample is\nlimited entirely to X-ray wavelengths, furthering the suggestion that the\nassumed achromaticity of jet breaks may not extend to high energies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The electrostatic charging of the test mass in ASTROD I (Astrodynamical Space\nTest of Relativity using Optical Devices I) mission can affect the quality of\nthe science data as a result of spurious Coulomb and Lorentz forces. To\nestimate the size of the resultant disturbances, credible predictions of\ncharging rates and the charging noise are required. Using the GEANT4 software\ntoolkit, we present a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the ASTROD I test mass\ncharging due to exposure of the spacecraft to galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) protons\nand alpha particles (3He, 4He) in the space environment. A positive charging\nrate of 33.3 e+/s at solar minimum is obtained. This figure reduces by 50% at\nsolar maximum. Based on this charging rate and factoring in the contribution of\nminor cosmic-ray components, we calculate the acceleration noise and stiffness\nassociated with charging. We conclude that the acceleration noise arising from\nCoulomb and Lorentz effects are well below the ASTROD I acceleration noise\nlimit at 0.1 mHz both at solar minimum and maximum. The coherent Fourier\ncomponents due to charging are investigated, it needs to be studied carefully\nin order to ensure that these do not compromise the quality of science data in\nthe ASTROD I mission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  HESS J1616-508 is one of the brightest emitters in the TeV sky. Recent\nobservations with the IBIS/ISGRI telescope on board the INTEGRAL spacecraft\nhave revealed that a young, nearby and energetic pulsar, PSR J1617-5055, is a\npowerful emitter of soft gamma-rays in the 20-100 keV domain. In this paper we\npresent an analysis of all available data from the INTEGRAL, Swift, BeppoSAX\nand XMM-Newton telescopes with a view to assessing the most likely counterpart\nto the HESS source. We find that the energy source that fuels the X/gamma-ray\nemissions is derived from the pulsar, both on the basis of the positional\nmorphology, the timing evidence and the energetics of the system. Likewise, the\n1.2% of the pulsar's spin down energy loss needed to power the 0.1-10 TeV\nemission is also fully consistent with other HESS sources known to be\nassociated with pulsars. The relative sizes of the X/gamma-ray and VHE sources\nare consistent with the expected lifetimes against synchrotron and Compton\nlosses for a single source of parent electrons emitted from the pulsar. We find\nthat no other known object in the vicinity could be reasonably considered as a\nplausible counterpart to the HESS source. We conclude that there is good\nevidence to assume that the HESS J1616-508 source is driven by PSR J1617-5055\nin which a combination of synchrotron and inverse Compton processes combine to\ncreate the observed morphology of a broad-band emitter from keV to TeV\nenergies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Herein the transient lunar phenomena (TLP) report database is subjected to a\ndiscriminating statistical filter robust against sites of spurious reports, and\nproduces a restricted sample that may be largely reliable. This subset is\nhighly correlated geographically with the catalog of outgassing events seen by\nthe Apollo 15, 16 and Lunar Prospector alpha-particle spectrometers for\nepisodic Rn-222 gas release. Both this robust TLP sample and even the larger,\nunfiltered sample are highly correlated with the boundary between mare and\nhighlands, as are both deep and shallow moonquakes, as well as Po-210, a\nlong-lived product of Rn-222 decay and a further tracer of outgassing. This\noffers another significant correlation relating TLPs and outgassing, and may\ntie some of this activity to sagging mare basalt plains (perhaps mascons).\nAdditionally, low-level but likely significant TLP activity is connected to\nrecent, major impact craters (while moonquakes are not), which may indicate the\neffects of cracks caused by the impacts, or perhaps avalanches, allowing\nrelease of gas. The majority of TLP (and Rn-222) activity, however, is confined\nto one site that produced much of the basalt in the Procellarum Terrane, and it\nseems plausible that this TLP activity may be tied to residual outgassing from\nthe formerly largest volcanic ffusion sites from the deep lunar interior. With\nthe coming in the next few years of robotic spacecraft followed by human\nexploration, the study of TLPs and outgassing is both promising and imperiled.\nWe will have an unprecedented pportunity to study lunar outgassing, but will\nalso deal with a greater burden of anthropogenic lunar gas than ever produced.\nThere is a pressing need to study lunar atmosphere and its sources while still\npristine.

Using a model CME hydrodynamic evolution\nbased on observations of CMEs propagating in the plane of the sky and on\ntheoretical models, we integrate time dependent equations for the ionization\nbalance of various elements to compare with ACE data. We find that plasma in\nthe CME ``core'' typically requires further heating following filament\neruption, with thermal energy input similar to the kinetic energy input. This\nextra heating is presumably the result of post eruptive reconnection. Plasma\ncorresponding to the CME ``cavity'' is usually not further ionized, since\nwhether heated or not, the low density gives freeze-in close the the Sun. The\ncurrent analysis is limited by ambiguities in the underlying model CME\nevolution. Such methods are likely to reach their full potential when applied\nto data to be acquired by STEREO when at optimum separation. CME evolution\nobserved with one spacecraft may be used to interpret CME charge states\ndetected by the other.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present the unsaturated peak profile of SGR 1900+14 giant flare on 1998\nAugust 27. This was obtained by particle counters of the Low Energy Particle\ninstrument onboard the GEOTAIL spacecraft. The observed peak profile revealed\nfour characteristic structures: initial steep rise, intermediate rise to the\npeak, exponential decay and small hump in the decay phase. From this light\ncurve, we found that the isotropic peak luminosity was $2.3\\times10^{46}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ and the total energy was $4.3 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($E\\gtrsim$\n50 keV), assuming that the distance to SGR 1900+14 is 15 kpc and that the\nspectrum is optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung with $kT =$ 240 keV. These\nare consistent with the previously reported lower limits derived from Ulysses\nand Konus-Wind observations. A comparative study of the initial spikes of SGR\n1900+14 giant flare in 1998 and SGR 1806-20 in 2004 is also presented. The\ntimescale of the initial steep rise shows the magnetospheric origin, while the\ntimescale of the intermediate rise to the peak indicates that it originates\nfrom the crustal fracturing. Finally, we argue that the four structures and\ntheir corresponding timescales provide a clue to identify extragalactic SGR\ngiant flares among short GRBs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Ulysses spacecraft has been orbiting the Sun on a highly inclined ellipse\nalmost perpendicular to the ecliptic plane (inclination 79 deg, perihelion\ndistance 1.3 AU, aphelion distance 5.4 AU) since it encountered Jupiter in\n1992. The in-situ dust detector on board continuously measured interstellar\ndust grains with masses up to 10^-13 kg, penetrating deep into the solar\nsystem. The flow direction is close to the mean apex of the Sun's motion\nthrough the solar system and the grains act as tracers of the physical\nconditions in the local interstellar cloud (LIC). While Ulysses monitored the\ninterstellar dust stream at high ecliptic latitudes between 3 and 5 AU,\ninterstellar impactors were also measured with the in-situ dust detectors on\nboard Cassini, Galileo and Helios, covering a heliocentric distance range\nbetween 0.3 and 3 AU in the ecliptic plane. The interstellar dust stream in the\ninner solar system is altered by the solar radiation pressure force,\ngravitational focussing and interaction of charged grains with the time varying\ninterplanetary magnetic field. We review the results from in-situ interstellar\ndust measurements in the solar system and present Ulysses' latest interstellar\ndust data. These data indicate a 30 deg shift in the impact direction of\ninterstellar grains w.r.t. the interstellar helium flow direction, the reason\nof which is presently unknown.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The solar wind conditions at one astronomical unit (AU) can be strongly\ndisturbed by the interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). A subset,\ncalled magnetic clouds (MCs), is formed by twisted flux ropes that transport an\nimportant amount of magnetic flux and helicity which is released in CMEs. At 1\nAU from the Sun, the magnetic structure of MCs is generally modeled neglecting\ntheir expansion during the spacecraft crossing. However, in some cases, MCs\npresent a significant expansion. We present here an analysis of the huge and\nsignificantly expanding MC observed by the Wind spacecraft during 9 and 10\nNovember, 2004. After determining an approximated orientation for the flux rope\nusing the minimum variance method, we precise the orientation of the cloud axis\nrelating its front and rear magnetic discontinuities using a direct method.\nThis method takes into account the conservation of the azimuthal magnetic flux\nbetween the in- and out-bound branches, and is valid for a finite impact\nparameter (i.e., not necessarily a small distance between the spacecraft\ntrajectory and the cloud axis). Moreover, using the direct method, we find that\nthe ICME is formed by a flux rope (MC) followed by an extended coherent\nmagnetic region. These observations are interpreted considering the existence\nof a previous larger flux rope, which partially reconnected with its\nenvironment in the front. These findings imply that the ejected flux rope is\nprogressively peeled by reconnection and transformed to the observed ICME (with\na remnant flux rope in the front part).",
