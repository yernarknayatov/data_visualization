    "abstract": "Abstract:  Although the Cassini Spacecraft and the Huygens lander provided numerous\ninformation about Titan atmospheric chemistry and the formation of its\naerosols, the exact composition of these aerosols still remains unknown. A\nfruitful proxy to investigate these aerosols is the use of laboratory\nexperiments that allow producing and studying analogs of Titan aerosol, the\nso35 called tholins. Even when produced in the laboratory, unveiling the exact\ncomposition of the aerosol remains problematic due to the high complexity of\nthe material. Numerous advances have been recently made using high-resolution\nmass spectrometry (HRMS) (Pernot et al. 2010, Somogyi et al. 2012, Gautier et\nal. 2014) that allowed the separation of isobaric compounds and a robust\nidentification of chemical species composing tholins regarding their molecular\nformulae. Nevertheless isomeric species cannot be resolved by a simple mass\nmeasurement. We propose here an analysis of tholins by high performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) coupled to HRMS to unveil this isomeric ambiguity for\nsome of the major tholins compounds. By comparing chromatograms obtained when\nanalyzing tholins and chemical standards, we strictly identified seven\nmolecules in our tholins samples: melamine, cyanoguanidine,\n6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 3-amino-\n1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-Dimethyl-1,2,4-triazole and 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine.\nSeveral molecules, including hexamethylenetriamine (HMT) were not present at\ndetectable levels in our sample. The use for the first time of a coupled\nHPLC-HRMS technique applied to tholins study demonstrated the interest of such\na technique compared to single high-resolution mass spectrometry for the study\nof tholins composition.",

The IPN localization of the source is consistent\nwith the position of the recently discovered soft gamma-repeater SGR 1935+2154.\nFrom the Konus-Wind (KW) observation, we derive temporal and spectral\nparameters of the emission, and the burst energetics. The rather long duration\nof the burst ($\\sim$1.7 s) and the large measured energy fluence\n($\\sim2.5\\times10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) put it in the class of rare\n\"intermediate\" SGR flares, and this is the first one observed from SGR\n1935+2154. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the KW light curve\nyields no statistically significant signal. Of four spectral models tested,\noptically thin thermal bremsstrahlung and a single blackbody (BB) function can\nbe rejected on statistical grounds; two more complex models, a cutoff power law\n(CPL) and a sum of two BB functions (2BB), fit the burst spectra well and\nneither of them may be ruled out by the KW observation. The CPL and 2BB model\nparameters we report for this bright flare are typical of SGRs; they are also\nconsistent with those obtained from observations of much weaker and shorter SGR\n1935+2154 bursts with other instruments. From the distribution of double\nblackbody spectral fit parameters we estimate the SGR 1935+2154 distance to be\n$<$10.0 kpc, in agreement with that of the Galactic supernova remnant G57.2+0.8\nat 9.1 kpc.",

The burst was associated with\na large solar eruption that occurred on the backside of the Sun (N05E151) close\nto the disk center in the STB view. The eruption was also observed by the\nSTEREO Ahead (STA) spacecraft (located at 149 degrees ahead of Earth) as an\neruption close to the west limb (N05W60) in that view. The type IV burst was\ncomplete in STB observations in that the envelope reached the lowest frequency\nand then receded to higher frequencies. The burst was partial viewed from STA,\nrevealing only the edge coming down to the lowest frequency. The type IV burst\nwas not observed at all near Earth because the source was 61 degrees behind the\neast limb. The eruption was associated with a low-frequency type II burst\nobserved in all three views, although it was not very intense. Solar energetic\nparticles were also observed at both STEREOs and at SOHO, suggesting that the\nshock was much extended, consistent with the very high speed of the CME (about\n2048 km/s). These observations suggest that the type IV emission is directed\nalong a narrow cone above the flare site. We confirm this result statistically\nusing the type IV bursts of solar cycle 23.",

We examine a total of 79\nGRBs by comparing the observed counts over a range of time intervals to that\nexpected from designated background orbits, as well as by using a joint\nlikelihood technique to model the expected distribution of stacked counts. We\nfind strong evidence for subthreshold emission at MeV to GeV energies using\nboth techniques. This observed excess is detected during intervals that include\nand exceed the durations typically characterizing the prompt emission observed\nat keV energies and lasts at least 2700 s after the co-aligned burst trigger.\nBy utilizing a novel cumulative likelihood analysis, we find that although a\nburst's prompt gamma-ray and afterglow X-ray flux both correlate with the\nstrength of the subthreshold emission, the X-ray afterglow flux measured by\nSwift's X-ray Telescope (XRT) at 11 hr post trigger correlates far more\nsignificantly. Overall, the extended nature of the subthreshold emission and\nits connection to the burst's afterglow brightness lend further support to the\nexternal forward shock origin of the late-time emission detected by the LAT.\nThese results suggest that the extended high-energy emission observed by the\nLAT may be a relatively common feature but remains undetected in a majority of\nbursts owing to instrumental threshold effects.",

Assuming that radiolysis has been the only O2\nproduction mechanism at work, we conclude that the formation of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is possible in a dense and early protosolar nebula in\nthe framework of two extreme scenarios: (1) agglomeration from pristine\namorphous icy grains/particles formed in ISM and (2) agglomeration from\nclathrates that formed during the disk's cooling.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The nature of the icy material accreted by comets during their formation in\nthe outer regions of the protosolar nebula is a major open question in\nplanetary science. Some scenarios of comet formation predict that these bodies\nagglomerated from crystalline ices condensed in the protosolar nebula.\nConcurrently, alternative scenarios suggest that comets accreted amorphous ice\noriginating from the interstellar cloud or from the very distant regions of the\nprotosolar nebula. On the basis of existing laboratory and modeling data, we\nfind that the N$_2$/CO and Ar/CO ratios measured in the coma of the Jupiter\nfamily comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the ROSINA instrument aboard the\nEuropean Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft match those predicted for gases\ntrapped in clathrates. If these measurements are representative of the bulk\nN$_2$/CO and Ar/CO ratios in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it implies that the\nices accreted by the comet formed in the nebula and do not originate from the\ninterstellar medium, supporting the idea that the building blocks of outer\nsolar system bodies have been formed from clathrates and possibly from pure\ncrystalline ices. Moreover, because 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is impoverished\nin Ar and N$_2$, the volatile enrichments observed in Jupiter's atmosphere\ncannot be explained solely via the accretion of building blocks with similar\ncompositions and require an additional delivery source. A potential source may\nbe the accretion of gas from the nebula that has been progressively enriched in\nheavy elements due to photoevaporation.",

One full year (155\nCluster orbits) of the Earth's magnetosphere is simulated using Grand Unified\nMagnetosphere Ionosphere Coupling simulation (GUMICS-4) magnetohydrodynamic\ncode. Real solar wind measurements are given to the code as input to create the\nlongest lasting global magnetohydrodynamics simulation to date. The\napplicability of the results of the simulation depends critically on the input\nparameters used in the model. Therefore, the validity and the variance of the\nOMNIWeb data is first investigated thoroughly using Cluster measurement close\nto the bow shock. The OMNIWeb and the Cluster data were found to correlate very\nwell before the bow shock. The solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameters\nare not changed significantly from the $L_1$ Lagrange point to the foreshock,\ntherefore the OMNIWeb data is appropriate input to the GUMICS-4. The Cluster\nSC3 footprints are determined by magnetic field mapping from the simulation\nresults and the Tsyganenko (T96) model in order to compare two methods. The\ndetermined footprints are in rather good agreement with the T96. However, it\nwas found that the footprints agree better in the northern hemisphere than the\nsouthern one during quiet conditions. If the By is not zero, the agreement of\nthe GUMICS-4 and T96 footprint is worse in longitude in the southern\nhemisphere. Overall, the study implies that a 3D MHD model can increase our\ninsight of the response of the magnetosphere to solar wind conditions.",

We also discuss recent observations of similar SEP\nevents in Cycle 24 made by the STEREO spacecraft. The observations show, for\nexample, that the time distribution of ~25 MeV proton events varies from cycle\nto cycle. In particular, the time evolution of the SEP occurrence rate in Cycle\n24 is strongly asymmetric between the northern and southern solar hemispheres,\nand tracks the sunspot number in each hemisphere, whereas Cycle 23 was more\nsymmetric. There was also an absence of 25 MeV proton events during the solar\nminimum preceding Cycle 24 (other minima show occasional, often reasonably\nintense events). So far, events comparable to the exceptionally intense events\ndetected in Cycles 22 and 23 have not been observed at Earth in Cycle 24,\nthough Cycle 21 (the largest of the cycles considered here) also apparently\nlacked such events. We note a correlation between the rates of intense 25 MeV\nproton events and \"ground level enhancements\" (GLEs) observed by neutron\nmonitors, since 1967, and conclude that the number of \"official\" GLEs observed\nto date in Cycle 24 appears to be significantly lower than expected (5 to\n7+/-1) based on the rate of intense 25 MeV proton events in this cycle.",

Close to\nthe $k_\\perp$ axis, $\\left| {E}_{R}\\right|$ becomes larger while R$_{A}$\nbecomes smaller, suggesting that the dominance of magnetic energy over kinetic\nenergy becomes more significant at small $k_\\parallel$. R$_{E}$ is larger at\nsmall $k_\\parallel$, implying that PSD$_{2D}(k_\\parallel,k_\\perp )$ of\n$\\textbf{Z}_{minor}$ is more concentrated along the $k_\\perp$ direction as\ncompared to that of $\\textbf{Z}_{major}$. The residual energy condensate at\nsmall $k_\\parallel$ is consistent with simulation results in which E$_{R}$ is\nspontaneously generated by Alfv\u00e9n wave interaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a study of magnetic field fluctuations, in a slow solar wind\nstream, close to ion scales, where an increase of the level of magnetic\ncompressibility is observed. Here, the nature of these compressive fluctuations\nis found to be characterized by coherent structures. Although previous studies\nhave shown that current sheets can be considered as the principal cause of\nintermittency at ion scales, here we show for the first time that, in the case\nof the slow solar wind, a large variety of coherent structures contributes to\nintermittency at proton scales, and current sheets are not the most common.\nSpecifically, we find compressive ($\\delta b_{\\|} \\gg \\delta b_{\\perp}$),\nlinearly polarized structures in the form of magnetic holes, solitons and shock\nwaves. Examples of Alfv\u00e9nic structures ($\\delta b_{\\perp} > \\delta b_{\\|}$)\nare identified as current sheets and vortex-like structures. Some of these\nvortices have $ \\delta b_{\\perp} \\gg \\delta b_{\\|}$, as in the case of Alfv\u00e9n\nvortices, but the majority of them are characterized by $\\delta b_{\\perp}\n\\gtrsim \\delta b_{\\|}$. Thanks to multi-point measurements by Cluster\nspacecraft, for about 100 structures, we could determine the normal, the\npropagation velocity and the spatial scale along this normal. Independently of\nthe nature of the structures, the normal is always perpendicular to the local\nmagnetic field, meaning that $k_{\\perp} \\gg k_{\\parallel}$. The spatial scales\nof the studied structures are found to be between 2 and 8 times the proton\ngyroradius. Most of them are simply convected by the wind, but 25\\% propagate\nin the plasma frame. Possible interpretations of the observed structures and\nthe connection with plasma heating are discussed.",

Pluto's albedo\nfeatures are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous\nlow-albedo dust may be responsible for features seen to the west of the area\ninformally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon\nare latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker\nregions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole The\nphase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune\nbelieved to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar\nto that of the Moon. Preliminary Bond albedos are 0.25+/-0.03 for Charon and\n0.72+/-0.07 for Pluto. Maps of an approximation to the Bond albedo for both\nPluto and Charon are presented for the first time.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The nature of the flow below the cloud level on Jupiter and Saturn is still\nunknown. Relating the flow on these planets to perturbations in their density\nfield is key to the analysis of the gravity measurements expected from both the\nJuno (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) spacecrafts during 2016-17. Both missions\nwill provide latitude-dependent gravity fields, which in principle could be\ninverted to calculate the vertical structure of the observed cloud-level zonal\nflow on these planets. Theories to date connecting the gravity field and the\nflow structure have been limited to potential theories under a barotropic\nassumption, or estimates based on thermal wind balance that allow analyzing\nbaroclinic wind structures, but have made simplifying assumptions. Those\ninclude the effects of the deviations from spherical symmetry, the centrifugal\nforce due to density perturbations, and self-gravitational effects of the\ndensity perturbations. Recent studies attempted to include some effects but not\nin a self-consistent manner. The present study introduces such a\nself-consistent perturbation approach to the thermal wind balance that\nincorporates all physical effects, and applies it to several example wind\nstructures, both barotropic and baroclinic. The contribution of each term is\nanalyzed, and the results are compared in the barotropic limit to those of\npotential theory. It is found that the dominant balance involves the original\nsimplified thermal wind approach. This balance produces a good\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the gravitational moments, and is able,\ntherefore, to address the order one question of how deep the flows are given\nmeasurements of gravitational moments. The additional terms are significantly\nsmaller and none of these terms is dominant, so any approximation attempting to\nimprove over the simplified thermal wind approach needs to include all other\nterms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We report observations of homologous coronal jets and their coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) observed by instruments onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. The homologous\njets originated from a location with emerging and canceling magnetic field at\nthe southeast edge of the giant active region (AR) of 2014 October, NOAA 12192.\nThis AR produced in its interior many non-jet major flare eruptions (X and M\nclass) that made no CME. During 20-27 October, in contrast to the major-flare\neruptions in the interior, six of the homologous jets from the edge resulted in\nCMEs. Each jet-driven CME( ~200-300 kms) was slower-moving than most CMEs; had\nangular width (20-50 degree) comparable to that of the base of a coronal\nstreamer straddling the AR; and was of the `streamer-puff' variety, whereby the\npreexisting streamer was transiently inflated but not destroyed by the passage\nof the CME. Much of the transition-region-temperature plasma in the\nCME-producing jets escaped from the Sun, whereas relatively more of the\ntransition-region plasma in non-CME-producing jets fell back to the solar\nsurface. Also, the CME-producing jets tended to be faster and longer-lasting\nthan the non-CME-producing jets. Our observations imply: each jet and CME\nresulted from reconnection opening of twisted field that erupted from the jet\nbase; and the erupting field did not become a plasmoid as previously envisioned\nfor streamer-puff CMEs, but instead the jet-guiding streamer-base loop was\nblown out by the loop's twist from the reconnection.",

Two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been\ndetected close in time. From the multi-point in-situ observations, it can be\nfound that this SEP event was caused by the first CME, and the second one was\nnot involved. Using the velocity dispersion analysis (VDA), we find that for\nwell magnetically connected point, the energetic protons and electrons are\nreleased nearly at the same time. The path lengths to STEREO-B(STB) of protons\nand electrons have distinct difference and deviate remarkably from the nominal\nParker spiral path length, which is likely due to the presence of\ninterplanetary magnetic structures situated between the source and the STB.\nAlso the VDA method seems only to obtain reasonable results at well-connected\nlocations and the inferred energetic particles release times in different\nenergy channels are similar. We suggest that good-connection is crucial for\nobtaining both accurate release time and path length simultaneously, agreeing\nwith the modeling result of Wang & Qin (2015).",

All models to date,\nrelating the winds to the gravity field, have been in the forward direction,\nthus allowing only calculation of the gravity field from given wind models.\nHowever, there is a need to do the inverse problem since the new observations\nwill be of the gravity field. Here, an inverse dynamical model, is developed to\nrelate the expected measurable gravity field, to perturbations of the density\nand wind fields, and therefore to the observed cloud-level winds. In order to\ninvert the gravity field into the 3D circulation, an adjoint model is\nconstructed for the dynamical model, thus allowing backward integration. This\ntool is used for examination of various scenarios, simulating cases in which\nthe depth of the wind depends on latitude. We show that it is possible to use\nthe gravity measurements to derive the depth of the winds, both on Jupiter and\nSaturn, taking into account also measurement errors. Calculating the solution\nuncertainties, we show that the wind depth can be determined more precisely in\nthe low-to-midlatitudes. In addition, the gravitational moments are found to be\nparticularly sensitive to flows at the equatorial intermediate depths,\ntherefore we expect that if deep winds exist on these planets they will have a\nmeasurable signature by Juno and Cassini.",

This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as\na reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a\ndirected energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high\nsurface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an\nejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the\nobject. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses\nconventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the\nspacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation,\nthe asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest\nspacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a\nsystem of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity\ntractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m\ndiameter) asteroid with a 1- to 15-year targeting time (laser on time)\ndepending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission\nparameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and\nsize. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than\ncurrent proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect\nall known threats with sufficient warning.",

The test particle can move in bounded orbits around\nthe Moon or escape through the openings around the Lagrange points $L_1$ and\n$L_2$ or even collide with the surface of the Moon. We explore in detail the\nfirst four of the five possible Hill's regions configurations depending on the\nvalue of the Jacobi constant which is of course related with the total orbital\nenergy. We conduct a thorough numerical analysis on the phase space mixing by\nclassifying initial conditions of orbits in several two-dimensional types of\nplanes and distinguishing between four types of motion: (i) ordered bounded,\n(ii) trapped chaotic, (iii) escaping and (iv) collisional. In particular, we\nlocate the different basins and we relate them with the corresponding spatial\ndistributions of the escape and collision times. Our outcomes reveal the high\ncomplexity of this planetary system. Furthermore, the numerical analysis\nsuggests a strong dependence of the properties of the considered basins with\nboth the total orbital energy and the initial value of the $z$ coordinate, with\na remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the regimes. Our\nresults are compared with earlier ones regarding the planar version of the\nEarth-Moon system.",

This analysis implies that 1) the \"Phoebe\" ring\nis partially sourced by debris from irregular satellites beyond Phoebe's orbit\nand 2) the scattered light signal is dominated by small grains ($\\lesssim\n20\\mu$m in size). If we assume that the Phoebe ring is generated through\nsteady-state micrometeoroid bombardment, this implies a power-law size\ndistribution with index $> 4$, which is unusually steep among solar system\nrings.

As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the\nnearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We\nhave to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the\nstars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream\nof human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it\nis not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we\nshould choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it\nis within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will\nlead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a\nvast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far\nbeyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer (\"wafersats\")\nthat reach more than $1/4c$ and reach the nearest star in 20 years to\nspacecraft with masses more than $10^5$ kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of\ngreater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently\nunimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a\nfundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a\nspacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting\nhumans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated\noptical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors\ncombined with directed energy propulsion.",

However,\nfor small grains, as they are often observed in space environments, a\ndependence on grain size is expected due to secondary electron emission (SEE).\nHere, by the term \"small\" we mean a particle size comparable to the typical\npenetration depth for given primary electron energy. The results are relevant\nfor the dynamics of small, charged dust particles emitted by the volcanic moon\nIo, which form the Jovian dust streams. We revise the theory of charging of\nsmall (sub-micron sized) micrometeoroids to take into account a high production\nof secondary electrons for small grains immersed in an isotropic flux of\nelectrons. We apply our model to obtain an improved estimate for the charge of\nthe dust streams leaving the Jovian system, detected by several spacecraft. For\nthe Jupiter plasma environment we derive the surface potential of grains\ncomposed of NaCl (believed to be the major constituent of Jovian dust stream\nparticles) or silicates. For small particles the potential depends on grain\nsize and the secondary electron current induces a sensitivity to material\nproperties. As a result of the small particle effect, the estimates for the\ncharging times and for the fractional charge fluctuations of NaCl grains\nobtained using our general approach to SEE give results qualitatively different\nfrom the analogous estimates derived from the traditional approach to SEE. We\nfind that for the charging environment considered in this paper field emission\ndoes not limit the charging of NaCl grains.",

The combination of\nfinite duration and aperiodic modulations make GRBs hard to characterise\ntemporally.

The heliopause, analogous to the\nmagnetopause forming the outer boundary of the lobes, may then lie beyond this\nso-called \"heliocliff\".

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The electric solar wind sail (E-sail) is a way to propel a spacecraft by\nusing the natural solar wind as a thrust source. The problem of secular\nspinrate change was identified earlier which is due to the orbital Coriolis\neffect and tends to slowly increase or decrease the sail's spinrate, depending\non which way the sail is inclined with respect to the solar wind. Here we\npresent an E-sail design and its associated control algorithm which enable\nspinrate control during propulsive flight by the E-sail effect itself. In the\ndesign, every other maintether (\"T-tether\") is galvanically connected through\nthe remote unit with the two adjacent auxtethers, while the other maintethers\n(\"I-tethers\") are insulated from the tethers. This enables one to effectively\ncontrol the maintether and auxtether voltages separately, which in turn enables\nspinrate control. We use a detailed numerical simulation to show that the\nalgorithm can fully control the E-sail's spin state in real solar wind. The\nsimulation includes a simple and realistic set of controller sensors: an imager\nto detect remote unit angular positions and a vector accelerometer. The imager\nresolution requirement is modest and the accelerometer noise requirement is\nfeasible to achieve. The TI tether rig enables building E-sails that are able\nto control their spin state fully and yet are actuated by pure tether voltage\nmodulation from the main spacecraft and requiring no functionalities from the\nremote units during flight.",

Another significant contribution from this\nthesis is an innovative three-dimensional approach of spectral analysis that\ncould be used to study surface compositional heterogeneity of Vesta (Thangjam\net al., 2016). The three band parameter space with defined polyhedrons is more\nadvanced and robust compared to the generally used two-dimensional spectral\nanalysis i.e., two band parameter space.

These allow for\nefficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal\nLyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor\nof Nearby Orbits (MEGNO).\nIn this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of\nvariational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential\nequations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body\nproblem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including\noptimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the\nsolution, like the classical Newton's method. Typically, these methods have\nfaster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also\nrequired for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods\nwhich provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods.\nSuch improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from\nradial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory\noptimization to asteroid deflection.\nWe provide an implementation of first and second-order variational equations\nfor the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation\nallows the simultaneous integration of any number of first and second-order\nvariational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The main benefit of an interstellar mission is to carry out in-situ\nmeasurements within a target star system. To allow for extended in-situ\nmeasurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most\npromising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the\ndeflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the\nspacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high\nvelocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to\ndeceleration durations of several decades depending on the spacecraft mass.\nWithin the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of\nInterstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for\ndecelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic\nsail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each\ntechnologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher\nvelocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using\nboth sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail\nfor various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total\nspacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from 5% c, to interplanetary\nvelocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about 29 years, whereas the\nelectric sail alone would take 35 years and the magnetic sail about 40 years\nwith a total spacecraft mass of 8250 kg. Furthermore, it is assessed how the\ncombined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture\nfor different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would\ninvestigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially\nwould affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of\ninterstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We address the problem of calculating the transverse magnetic field in the\nsolar wind outside of the hypothetical sphere called the source surface where\nthe solar wind originates. This calculation must overcome a widely used\nfundamental assumption about the source surface -- the field is normally\nrequired to purely radial at the source surface. Our model rests on the fact\nthat a change in the radial field strength at the source surface is a change in\nthe field line density. Surrounding field lines must move laterally in order to\naccommodate this field line density change. As the outward wind velocity drags\nfield lines past the source surface this lateral component of motion produces a\ntilt implying there is a transverse component to the field.\nAn analytic method of calculating the lateral translation speed of the field\nlines is developed. We apply the technique to an interval of approximately two\nCarrington rotations at the beginning of 2011 using 2-h averages of data from\nthe Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nspacecraft. We find that the value of the transverse magnetic field is\ndominated on a global scale by the effects of high latitude concentrations of\nfield lines being buffetted by supergranular motions.",

With almost 20 years of data, the Electron Proton\nHelium INstrument (EPHIN) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nis well suited for this kind of investigation. Although the design of the\ninstrument is optimized to measure proton and helium isotope spectra up to 50\nMeV nucleon$^{-1}$ , the capability exists to determine proton energy spectra\nfrom 250 MeV up to above 1.6 GeV. Therefore we developed a sophisticated\ninversion method to calculate such proton spectra. The method relies on a\nGEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the instrument and a simplified spacecraft\nmodel that calculates the energy-response function of EPHIN for electrons,\nprotons and heavier ions. For validation purposes, proton spectra based on this\nmethod are compared to various balloon missions and space instrumentation.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Comet 103P/Hartley 2 has diurnally controlled, CO2-driven activity on the tip\nof the small lobe of its bilobate nucleus. Such activity is unique among the\ncomet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO2 ice is very near the\nsurface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that\nthermophysically evolved for ~45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter\nFamily of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a\nvery plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~11 [10-13]\nhours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2's currently active regions\nthat excavated down to CO2-rich ices and activated the small lobe of the\nnucleus. At Hartley 2's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the\nnucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~3-4 orbits\nprior to the DIXI flyby (~1984-1991). This coincides with Hartley 2's discovery\nin 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO2 activity facilitated the\ncomet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be\nlofted off the surface by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum\nmoving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus.\nMuch of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would\nreimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency\ndistribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of\nmaterial in its inner coma suggest that the 20-40 meter mounds observed by the\nDIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris\ndeposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~11 hours to 18.34\nhours at the time of the DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where\nmaterials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to\nplace relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.",
