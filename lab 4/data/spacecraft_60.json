    "abstract": "Abstract:  In order to investigate the universality of magnetic turbulence in space\nplasmas we analyze seven time periods in the free solar wind of different\norigin, slow or fast, and under different plasma conditions. The orientation of\nmagnetic field to the flow velocity was always quasi-perpendicular. Unique\ncombination of three instruments on Cluster spacecraft which operate in\ndifferent frequency ranges give us the possibility to resolve spectra up to 300\nHz. We show that spectra measured under different plasma conditions have a\nsimilar shape. Such a quasi-universal spectrum consists of three parts: two\npower laws and an exponential domain. At MHD scales, Kolmogorov's law $\\sim\nk^{-5/3}$ is found. At scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, a\n$k^{-2.8}$ law is observed. At scales $k\\rho_e\\sim (0.1-1)$, where $\\rho_e$ is\nthe electron gyroradius, the magnetic spectrum follows an exponential law\n$\\exp(-k^{1/2})$, indicating the onset of dissipation. This is the first\nobservation of an exponential magnetic spectrum in space plasmas. We show that\namong several spatial kinetic plasma scales, the electron Larmor radius plays\nthe role of a dissipation scale in space plasma turbulence.",

In the hard X-ray band the SuperAGILE imager provides localization\nof about one GRB/month plus the detection of 1-2 GRBs per month out of its\nfield of view. The Mini-Calorimeter detects about one GRB/week in the 350keV -\n100MeV energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.\nIn fact, the on-board MCAL trigger logic, implemented for the first time on\ntime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for very\nshort bursts detection. The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID), sensitive in the\n30MeV - 30GeV range, firmly detected three GRBs (GRB080514B, GRB090401B and\nGRB090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. Moreover,\nall GRBs localized by other spacecrafts inside the GRID field of view are\ncurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided.

The cost to develop this kind of\npropulsion system in space would be very high, but it can also be developed on\nearth by a magnetically insulated Super Marx Generator. Since the ignition of\ndeuterium is theoretically possible with the Super Marx Generator, rather than\ndeuterium-tritium with a laser where 80% of the energy goes into neutrons,\nwould also mean a breakthrough in fusion research, and therefore would justify\nthe large development costs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The radio-metric tracking data received from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft\nfrom the distances between 20-70 astronomical units from the Sun has\nconsistently indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, blue-shifted Doppler\nfrequency drift that limited the accuracy of the orbit reconstruction for these\nvehicles. This drift was interpreted as a sunward acceleration of a_P =\n(8.74+/-1.33)x10^{-10} m/s^2 for each particular spacecraft. This signal has\nbecome known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly is still being\ninvestigated.\nRecently new Pioneer 10 and 11 radio-metric Doppler and flight telemetry data\nbecame available. The newly available Doppler data set is much larger when\ncompared to the data used in previous investigations and is the primary source\nfor new investigation of the anomaly. In addition, the flight telemetry files,\noriginal project documentation, and newly developed software tools are now used\nto reconstruct the engineering history of spacecraft. With the help of this\ninformation, a thermal model of the Pioneers was developed to study possible\ncontribution of thermal recoil force acting on the spacecraft. The goal of the\nongoing efforts is to evaluate the effect of on-board systems on the\nspacecrafts' trajectories and possibly identify the nature of this anomaly.\nTechniques developed for the investigation of the Pioneer anomaly are\napplicable to the New Horizons mission. Analysis shows that anisotropic thermal\nradiation from on-board sources will accelerate this spacecraft by ~41 x\n10^{-10} m/s^2. We discuss the lessons learned from the study of the Pioneer\nanomaly for the New Horizons spacecraft.",

In this paper we analyze disc-integrated light curves, treating\nEarth as if it were an exoplanet, to determine if we can detect the presence of\noceans and continents. We present two observations each spanning one day, taken\nat gibbous phases. The rotation of the planet leads to diurnal albedo\nvariations of 15-30%, with the largest relative changes occuring at the reddest\nwavelengths. To characterize these variations in an unbiased manner we carry\nout a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this\nanalysis reveals that 98% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only\n2 dominant eigencolors. We use the time-variations of these two eigencolors to\nconstruct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert\nsphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors\ncorrespond to cloud-free continents and oceans; this despite the fact that our\nobservations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the\nnear-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land\nand water. Based on this experiment we conclude that it should be possible to\ninfer the existence of water oceans on exoplanets with time-resolved broadband\nobservations taken by a large space-based coronagraphic telescope.",

The physical origin(s) of the so-called `EIT' waves is still\nstrongly debated. They are considered to be either wave (primarily fast-mode\nMHD waves) or non-wave (pseudo-wave) interpretations. The difficulty in\nunderstanding the nature of EUV waves lies with the limitations of the EIT\nobservations which have been used almost exclusively for their study. Their\nlimitations are largely overcome by the SECCHI/EUVI observations on-board the\nSTEREO mission. The EUVI telescopes provide high cadence, simultaneous\nmulti-temperature coverage, and two well-separated viewpoints. We present here\nthe first detailed analysis of an EUV wave observed by the EUVI disk imagers on\nDecember 07, 2007 when the STEREO spacecraft separation was $\\approx 45^\\circ$.\nBoth a small flare and a CME were associated with the wave cadence, and single\ntemperature and viewpoint coverage. These limitations are largely overcome by\nthe SECCHI/EUVI observations on-board the STEREO mission. The EUVI telescopes\nprovide high cadence, simultaneous multi-temperature coverage, and two\nwell-separated viewpoints. Our findings give significant support for a\nfast-mode interpretation of EUV waves and indicate that they are probably\ntriggered by the rapid expansion of the loops associated with the CME.",

The middle section\nof the S-shaped structure runs along the polarity inversion line of the\nphotospheric field, bridging the gap between the arcs. Flux cancellation occurs\nat the same location in the photosphere. The sigmoid forms in the gradual decay\nphase of the active region, which does not experience an eruption. These\nfindings correspond to the expected signatures of a flux rope forming, or being\naugmented, gradually by a topology transformation inside a magnetic arcade. In\nsuch a transformation, the plasma on newly formed helical field lines in the\nouter flux shell of the rope (S-shaped in projection) is expected to enter a\ncooling phase once the reconnection of their parent field line pairs (double-J\nshaped in projection) is complete. Thus, the data support the conjecture that\nflux ropes can exist in the corona prior to eruptive activity.",

Prompt\nimages and spectra are obtained with a co-aligned soft X-ray telescope (SXI;\n0.1 - 10keV) and with a 1.1m optical-IR telescope (IRT) simultaneously in 4\nbands (0.3 - 0.52micron, 0.52 - 0.9micron, 0.9 - 1.38micron, and 1.38 -\n2.3micron). An initial image (100s) will yield prompt identification within the\nHET error circle from a <2\" prompt SXI position; or from VIS vs. IR dropouts or\nvariability. An autonomous spacecraft re-point (<30\") will then put the GRB on\na 0.3\" x 4\" slit for either R = 3000 (for AB <21) or R =30 (for AB ~21-25)\nprompt spectra over the 0.3 - 0.9 micron and 0.9 - 2.3 micron bands. This will\nprovide onboard redshifts within ~500-2000sec for most GRBs, reaching z ~20\n(for Lyman-alpha breaks) if such GRBs exist, and spectra for studies of the\nhost galaxy and local re-ionization patchiness as well as intervening cosmic\nstructure. With ~600 GRBs/yr expected, including ~7-10% expected at z >7, EXIST\nwill open a new era in studies of the early Universe as well as carry out a\nrich program of AGN and transient-source science. An overview of the GRB\nscience objectives and a brief discussion of the overall mission design and\noperations is given, and example high-z GRB IRT spectra are shown.

The reported speed change for the NEAR\nspacecraft flyby is 13.46+-0.01 mm/s. It is known that general relativity\ntheory reduces to classical time-retarded electromagnetic field theory in the\nlinearized approximation. This report shows that time-retarded field theory\napplied to the Earth's transverse gravitational field gives rise to a small\nchange in the speed of a spacecraft during a flyby. The speed change depends on\nthe time dependence of the transverse gravitational field, which generates an\ninduction field that is proportional to the time derivative of the transverse\ngravitational field. If the corresponding speed for the induction field is set\nequal to (4.130+-0.003) times the Earth's equatorial rotational surface speed,\nand the speed of the Earth's gravitational field is set equal to (1.060+-0.001)\ntimes the vacuum speed of light, the calculated value for the speed change for\nthe NEAR flyby agrees exactly with the observed value. Similar results are\nfound for the remaining five flybys.",

Of particular interest for understanding coronal heating\nis a line of Ca XVII at 192.858 angstroms, formed near a temperature of 6\nmillion degrees. However, this line is blended with two Fe XI and six O V\nlines. In this paper we discuss a specific procedure to extract the Ca XVII\nline from the blend. We have performed this procedure on the raster data of\nfive active regions and a limb flare, and demonstrated that the Ca XVII line\ncan be satisfactorily extracted from the blend if the Ca XVII flux contributes\nto at least ~10% of the blend. We show examples of the high-temperature corona\ndepicted by the Ca XVII emission and find that the Ca XVII emission has three\nmorphological features in these active regions -- 1) `fat' medium-sized loops\nconfined in a smaller space than the 1 million degree corona, 2) weaker,\ndiffuse emission surrounding these loops that spread over the core of the\nactive region, and 3) the locations of the strong Ca XVII loops are often weak\nin line emission formed from the 1 million degree plasma. We find that the\nemission measure ratio of the 6 million degree plasma relative to the cooler 1\nmillion degree plasma in the core of the active regions, using the Ca XVII to\nFe XI line intensity ratio as a proxy, can be as high as 10.

To this end we\nobtained multiwavelength observations using the CDS spectrometer aboard SOHO,\nfacilities at the NSO/Sacramento Peak, and the TRACE and RHESSI spacecrafts.\nCDS spectroheliograms in the Fe XIX, Fe XVI, O V and He I lines allows us to\ndetermine the velocity field at different heights/temperatures during the flare\nand to compare them with the chromospheric velocity fields deduced from H alpha\nimage differences. TRACE images in the 17.1 nm band greatly help in determining\nthe morphology and the evolution of the flaring structures. During the\nimpulsive phase a strong blue-shifted Fe XIX component (-200 km/s) is observed\nat the footpoints of the flaring loop system, together with a red-shifted\nemission of O V and He I lines (20 km/s). In one footpoint simultaneous H alpha\ndata are also available and we find, at the same time and location, downflows\nwith an inferred velocity between 4 and 10 km/s. We also verify that the\n\"instantaneous\" momenta of the oppositely directed flows detected in Fe XIX and\nH alpha are equal within one order of magnitude. These signatures are in\ngeneral agreement with the scenario of explosive chromospheric evaporation.\nCombining RHESSI and CDS data after the coronal upflows have ceased, we prove\nthat, independently from the filling factor, an essential contribution to the\ndensity of the post-flare loop system is supplied from evaporated chromospheric\nmaterial. Finally, we consider the cooling of this loop system, that becomes\nsuccessively visible in progressively colder signatures during the gradual\nphase. We show that the observed cooling behaviour can be obtained assuming a\ncoronal filling factor between 0.2 and 0.5.",

Similarly, we show that estimates of the background\nreturned from the pseudo-global routine match the input values much more\nclosely than the estimates from the local fitting method.\nWe have also used the two fitting techniques to analyse a set of real solar\ndata collected by the Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies (GOLF) instrument\non board the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.\nSimilar differences between the estimated frequencies returned by the two\ntechniques are seen when fitting both the real and simulated data. We show that\nthe background fits returned by the pseudo-global routine more closely match\nthe estimate of the background one can infer from interpolating between fits to\nthe high and low frequency ends of the p-mode power spectrum.",

In chapter one we review the nature of the\nquantum vacuum and discuss the different contributions to the vacuum energy\ndensity arising from different sectors of the standard model. Next, in chapter\ntwo, we discuss cosmology and the introduction of the cosmological constant\ninto Einstein's field equations. In chapter three we explore the Casimir effect\nand study a number of mathematical techniques used to obtain a finite physical\nresult for the Casimir energy. We also review the experiments that have\nverified the Casimir force. In chapter four we discuss the introduction of\nextra dimensions into physics. We begin by reviewing Kaluza Klein theory, and\nthen discuss three popular higher dimensional models: bosonic string theory,\nlarge extra dimensions and warped extra dimensions. Chapter five is devoted to\nan original derivation of the Casimir energy we derived for the scenario of a\nhigher dimensional vector field coupled to a scalar field in the fifth\ndimension. In chapter six we explore a range of vacuum scenarios and discuss\nresearch we have performed regarding moduli stability. Chapter seven explores a\nnovel approach to spacecraft propulsion we have proposed based on the idea of\nmanipulating the extra dimensions of string/M theory. Finally, in chapter 8, we\ndiscuss some issues in heterotic string phenomenology derived from the free\nfermionic approach.",

The uncertainties\nassociated with the parallel transmission coefficients, a result of the\nphotometric repeatability of the observations, are seen to dominate the\naccuracy of p and theta.

The addition of an on-board digital\nreceiver would allow the up- and down-link Doppler frequencies to be measured\nseparately. Such separate, high-quality measurements allow optimal data\ncombinations that suppress the currently-leading noise sources: phase\nscintillation noise from the Earth's atmosphere and Doppler noise caused by\nmechanical vibrations of the ground antenna. Here we provide a general\nexpression for the optimal combination of ground and on-board Doppler data and\ncompute the sensitivity such a system would have to low-frequency gravitational\nwaves (GWs). Assuming a plasma scintillation noise calibration comparable to\nthat already demonstrated with the multi-link CASSINI radio system, the\nspace-clock/digital-receiver instrumentation enhancements would give GW strain\nsensitivity of $2.0 \\times 10^{-17}$ for randomly polarized, monochromatic GW\nsignals over a two-decade ($\\sim0.0001-0.01$ Hz) region of the low-frequency\nband. This is about an order of magnitude better than currently achieved with\ntraditional two-way coherent Doppler experiments. The utility of optimally\ncombining simultaneous up- and down-link observations is not limited to GW\nsearches. The Doppler tracking technique discussed here could be performed at\nminimal incremental cost to also improve other radio science experiments (i.e.\ntests of relativistic gravity, planetary and satellite gravity field\nmeasurements, atmospheric and ring occultations) on future interplanetary\nmissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We continue our presentation of an alternative cosmology based on conformal\ngravity, following our kinematical approach introduced in a recent paper. In\nline with the assumptions of our model, which proposes a closed-form expression\nfor the cosmic scale factor R(t), we first revise the Hubble and deceleration\nparameters and also introduce modified cosmological distances, analyzing in\nparticular the case of the luminosity distance.\nOur kinematical conformal cosmology is then able to explain the anomalous\nacceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft, as due to a local region of\ngravitational blueshift. From the reported values of the Pioneer anomaly we\nalso compute the current value of our first fundamental parameter, gamma_{0} =\n1.94 x 10^{-28} cm^{-1}, in line with the original estimate by P. Mannheim of\nthis quantity.\nOur second fundamental parameter, delta_{0} = 3.83 x 10^{-5}, interpreted as\nthe current value of a cosmological time variable, is derived from a detailed\nfitting of type Ia Supernovae \"gold-silver\" data, producing Hubble plots of the\nsame quality of those obtained by standard cosmology, but without requiring any\ndark matter or dark energy contribution.\nIf further experiments will confirm the presence of an anomalous frequency\nblueshift in the outer region of the Solar System, as described by our model,\nkinematical conformal cosmology might become a viable alternative to standard\ncosmological theories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This study based on longitudinal Zeeman effect magnetograms and spectral line\nscans investigates the dependence of solar surface magnetic fields on the\nspectral line used and the way the line is sampled in order to estimate the\nmagnetic flux emerging above the solar atmosphere and penetrating to the corona\nfrom magnetograms of the Mt. Wilson 150-foot tower synoptic program (MWO). We\nhave compared the synoptic program \\lambda5250\u00c5line of Fe I to the line of\nFe I at \\lambda5233\u00c5since this latter line has a broad shape with a profile\nthat is nearly linear over a large portion of its wings. The present study uses\nfive pairs of sampling points on the $\\lambda5233$\u00c5line. We recommend\nadoption of the field determined with a line bisector method with a sampling\npoint as close as possible to the line core as the best estimate of the\nemergent photospheric flux. The combination of the line profile measurements\nand the cross-correlation of fields measured simultaneously with \\lambda5250\u00c5\nand \\lambda5233\u00c5yields a formula for the scale factor 1/\\delta that\nmultiplies the MWO synoptic magnetic fields. The new calibration shows that\nmagnetic fields measured by the MDI system on the SOHO spacecraft are equal to\n0.619+/-0.018 times the true value at a center-to-limb position 30 deg. Berger\nand Lites (2003) found this factor to be 0.64+/-0.013 based on a comparison the\nthe Advanced Stokes Polarimeter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We model the interaction of the solar wind with the plasma tail of a comet by\nmeans of numerical simulations, taking into account the effects of viscous-like\nforces.A 2D hydrodynamical, two species, finite difference code has been\ndeveloped for the solution of the time dependent continuity, momentum and\nenergy conservation equations, as applied to the problem at hand. Velocity,\ndensity and temperature profiles across the tail are obtained. Several cases\nwith different flow parameters are considered in order to study the relative\nimportance of viscous-like effects and the coupling between species on the flow\ndynamics. Assuming a Mach number equal to 2 for the incident solar wind as it\nflows past the comet nucleus, the flow exhibits three transitions with location\nand properties depending on the Reynolds number for each species and on the\nratio of the timescale for inter-species coupling to the crossing time of the\nfree flowing solar wind. By comparing our results with the measurements taken\nin situ by the Giotto spacecraft during its flyby of comet Halley we constrain\nthe flow parameters for both plasmas. In the context of our approximations, we\nfind that our model is qualitatively consistent with the in situ measurements\nas long as the Reynolds number of the solar wind protons and of cometary H2O+\nions is low, less than 100, suggesting that viscous-like momentum transport\nprocesses may play an important role in the interaction of the solar wind and\nthe plasma environment of comets.",
