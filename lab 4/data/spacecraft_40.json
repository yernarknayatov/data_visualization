    "abstract": "Abstract:  We investigate the sequence of events leading to the solar X1 flare\nSOL2014-03-29T17:48. Because of the unprecedented joint observations of an\nX-flare with the ground-based Dunn Solar Telescope and the spacecraft IRIS,\nHinode, RHESSI, STEREO, and SDO, we can sample many solar layers from the\nphotosphere to the corona. A filament eruption was observed above a region of\nprevious flux emergence, which possibly led to a change in magnetic field\nconfiguration, causing the X-flare. This was concluded from the timing and\nlocation of the hard X-ray emission, which started to increase slightly less\nthan a minute after the filament accelerated. The filament showed Doppler\nvelocities of $\\sim$2-5 km s$^{-1}$ at chromospheric temperatures for at least\none hour before the flare occurred, mostly blueshifts, but also redshifts near\nits footpoints. 15 minutes before the flare, its chromospheric Doppler shifts\nincreased to $\\sim$6-10 km s$^{-1}$ and plasma heating could be observed,\nbefore it lifted off with at least 600 km s$^{-1}$, as seen in IRIS data.\nCompared to previous studies, this acceleration ($\\sim$3-5 km s$^{-2}$) is very\nfast, while the velocities are in the common range for coronal mass ejections.\nAn interesting feature was a low-lying twisted second filament near the\nerupting filament, which did not seem to participate in the eruption. After the\nflare ribbons started on each of the second filament's sides, it seems to have\nuntangled and vanished during the flare. These observations are some of the\nhighest resolution data of an X-class flare to date and reveal some small-scale\nfeatures yet to be explained.",

The method of investigation addressed in this work is\nthe visible and infrared spectrophotometry by imaging spectrometers, designed\nfor the observation of remote planetary atmospheres and surfaces, capable to\nacquire hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. The\ncontext under which this mission moves its steps is described in the first\nchapter. In the second chapter the performances of the VIRTS instrument,\nonboard Rosetta spacecraft, are analyzed in detail. In particular the modeling\nof the signal to noise ratio is the main argument of this chapter. The third\nchapter shows simulations of possible spectra of the comet's nucleus, which are\nuseful for both a comparison with real spectra, and for a planning of the\nobservations. Hapke's radiative transfer model is used to invert acquired data\nto infer physical properties. The fourth chapter introduces a method for\nspectral modeling. It includes the information on the instrumental noise,\npermitting the analysis of the goodness of the models, and an estimation of the\nerror of the retrieved parameters. The fifth chapter presents the spectral\nanalysis of Tempel 1 and Hartley 2 whose data are coming from Deep Impact space\nmission and its extended investigation. The sixth chapter shows the photometric\nanalysis of Lutetia asteroid, which was encountered by Rosetta during its\ncruise phase. This work have paved the way to the analysis of the final target\nof Rosetta: comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The tools presented are currently\nused by the VIRTIS Team to produce works on the comet, that are recommended to\nthe reader. Since a complete analysis on the comet is outside the scope of this\nwork, just preliminary results are shown here.",

As their atmospheres\npresent fast dynamic environments on various time scales, the availability of\ntime at professional telescopes is neither uniform nor of sufficient duration\nto assess temporal changes. However, numerous amateurs with small telescopes\n(of 15-40 cm) and modern hardware and software equipment can monitor these\nchanges daily (within the 360-900nm range). Amateurs are able to trace the\nstructure and the evolution of atmospheric features, such as major\nplanetary-scale disturbances, vortices, and storms. Their observations provide\na continuous record and it is not uncommon to trigger professional observations\nin cases of important events, such as sudden onset of global changes, storms\nand celestial impacts. For example, the continuous amateur monitoring has led\nto the discovery of fireballs in Jupiter's atmosphere, providing information\nnot only on Jupiter's gravitational influence but also on the properties and\npopulations of the impactors. Photometric monitoring of stellar occultations by\nthe planets can reveal spatial/temporal variability in their atmospheric\nstructure. Therefore, co-ordination and communication between professionals and\namateurs is important. We present examples of such collaborations that: (i)\nengage systematic multi-wavelength observations and databases, (ii) examine the\nvariability of cloud features over timescales from days to decades, (iii)\nprovide, by ground-based professional and amateur observations, the necessary\nspatial and temporal resolution of features that will be studied by the\ninterplanetary mission Juno, (iv) investigate video observations of Jupiter to\nidentify impacts of small objects, (v) carry out stellar-occultation campaigns.",

The\nHST UV instruments (STIS and ACS) can greatly contribute to the success of the\nJuno mission by providing key complementary views of Jupiter's UV aurora from\nEarth orbit.

The Juno mission\nwill be the first opportunity to measure simultaneously the energetic particles\nat high latitude and the auroral emissions they produce. Following programmatic\nand technical limitations, the amount of UVS data transmitted to Earth will be\nseverely restricted. Therefore, it is of extreme importance that HST captures\nas much additional information as possible on Jupiter's UV aurora during the\none-year life of the Juno mission.

There it can be investigated at leisure by astronauts\naboard an Orion or other spacecraft. The target for the mission has not yet\nbeen selected, and there are very few potential targets currently known. Though\nsufficiently small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are thought to be numerous, they\nare also difficult to detect and characterize with current observational\nfacilities. Here we collect the most up-to-date information on the smallest\nknown near-Earth asteroids to outline the properties of these small NEAs as\ncurrently understood, in order to examine what the eventual ARM target might be\nlike. Observational biases certainly mean that our sample is not an ideal\nrepresentation of the true population of small NEAs. However our sample is\nrepresentative of the eventual target list for the ARM mission, which will be\ncompiled under very similar observational constraints unless dramatic changes\nare made to the way near-Earth asteroids are searched for and studied.\nWe find that the typical rotation period is 40 minutes. The mean and median\naxis ratios were 1.43 and 1.29. Rotation rates much faster than the spin\nbarrier are seen, reaching below 30 seconds, and implying that most of these\nbodies are monoliths. Non-principal axis rotation is uncommon. Axial ratios\noften reach values as high as two, though no undisputed results reach above\nthree. We find little correlation of axis ratio with size. The most common\nspectral type in the sample of small NEAs is S-type (> 90%), with only a\nhandful of C and X types known.",

With\nthese first ever measurements inside a spacecraft from Earth to Mars, RAD\nobserved the impulsive enhancement of dose rate during solar particle events as\nwell as a gradual evolution of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) induced radiation\ndose rate due to the modulation of the primary GCR flux by the solar magnetic\nfield, which correlates with long-term solar activities and heliospheric\nrotation. Results: We analyzed the dependence of the dose rate measured by RAD\non solar modulation potentials and estimated the dose rate and dose equivalent\nunder different solar modulation conditions. These estimations help us to have\napproximate predictions of the cruise radiation environment, such as the\naccumulated dose equivalent associated with future human missions to Mars.\nConclusions: The predicted dose equivalent rate during solar maximum conditions\ncould be as low as one-fourth of the current RAD cruise measurement.

They are often preceded by a shock, and a\nmagnetic flux rope is detected in situ in a third to half of them. The main aim\nof this study is to obtain the best quantitative shape for the flux rope axis\nand for the shock surface from in situ data obtained during spacecraft\ncrossings of these structures. We first compare the orientation of the flux\nropes axes and shock normals obtained from independent data analyses of the\nsame events, observed in situ at 1AU from the Sun. Then, we carry out an\noriginal statistical analysis of axes/shock normals by deriving the statistical\ndistributions of their orientations. We fit the observed distributions using\nthe distributions derived from several synthetic models describing these\nshapes. We show that the distributions of axis/shock orientations are very\nsensitive to their respective shape. One classical model, used to analyze\ninterplanetary imager data, is incompatible with the in situ data. Two other\nmodels are introduced, for which the results for axis and shock normals lead to\nvery similar shapes; the fact that the data for MCs and shocks are independent\nstrengthen this result. The model which best fit all the data sets has an\nellipsoidal shape with similar aspect ratio values for all the data sets. These\nderived shapes for the flux rope axis and shock surface have several potential\napplications. First, these shapes can be used to construct a consistent ICME\nmodel. Second, these generic shapes can be used to develop a quantitative model\nto analyze imager data, as well as constraining the output of numerical\nsimulations of ICMEs. Finally, they will have implications for space weather\nforecasting, in particular for forecasting the time arrival of ICMEs at the\nEarth.",

We estimate that the flux of large\nimpactors (of absolute magnitude $H<16$) within $\\pm30^\\circ$ of Mars' aphelion\nis about four times larger than when the planet is near perihelion.\nExtrapolation of our results to a model population of meter-size Mars-crossers\nshows that if these small impactors have a uniform distribution of their\nangular elements, then their aphelion-to-perihelion impact flux ratio would be\nas large as 25. These theoretical predictions can be tested with observational\ndata of contemporary impacts that is becoming available from spacecraft\ncurrently in orbit about Mars.",

We apply seismic tools to the\nperiodicities to characterize the properties of KIC 3527751. Techniques to\nidentify modes include asymptotic period spacing relationships, frequency\nmultiplets, and the separation of multiplet splittings. These techniques allow\nfor 189 (75%) of the 251 periods to be associated with pulsation modes.\nIncluded in these are three sets of ell=4 multiplets and possibly an ell=9\nmultiplet. Period spacing sequences indicate ell=1 and 2 overtone spacings of\n266.4 +/-0.2 and 153.2 +/-0.2 seconds, respectively. We also calculate reduced\nperiods, from which we find evidence of trapped pulsations. Such mode trappings\ncan be used to constrain the core/atmosphere transition layers. Interestingly,\nfrequency multiplets in the g-mode region, which sample deep into the star,\nindicate a rotation period of 42.6 +/-3.4 days while p-mode multiplets, which\nsample the outer envelope, indicate a rotation period of 15.3 +/-0.7 days. We\ninterpret this as differential rotation in the radial direction with the core\nrotating more slowly. This is the first example of differential rotation for a\nsubdwarf B star.",

For each flare, the temperature\nand emission measure of the emitting plasma were determined from the spectrum\nof the continuum. In addition, with the SAX energy resolution of 0.6 keV (FWHM)\nat 6~keV, the intensities of the clearly resolved Fe-line complex at 6.7~keV\nand the Ca-line complex at 3.9~keV were determined, along with those of\nunresolved line complexes from S, Si, and Ar at lower energies. Comparisons of\nthese line intensities with theoretical spectra allow the abundances of these\nelements relative to hydrogen to be derived, with uncertainties due to\ninstrument calibration and the unknown temperature distribution of the emitting\nplasma. While significant deviations are found for the abundances of Fe and Ca\nfrom flare to flare, the abundances averaged over all flares are found to be\nenhanced over photospheric values by factors of $1.66 \\pm 0.34$ (Fe),\n$3.89~\\pm~0.76$ (Ca), $1.23~\\pm~0.45$ (S), $1.64~\\pm~0.66$ (Si), and\n$2.48~\\pm~0.90$ (Ar).

For each spectrum,\nthe method first optimizes element abundances then derives the differential\nemission measure as a function of temperature based on a procedure given by\nSylwester et al. and Withbroe. This contrasts with our previous analyses of\nRESIK spectra in which an isothermal assumption was used.

This problem is more difficult than tracking\na ballistic trajectory, because an operative affects unknown and arbitrarily\nchanging accelerations. Although stochastic methods of filtering or state\nestimation (Kalman filters and particle filters) are widely used, out of vogue\nvariational methods are more appropriate in this tracking context, because the\nobjects do not typically display any significant random motions at the length\nand time scales of interest. This leads us to propose a rather elegant approach\nbased on a \\emph{shadowing filter}. The resulting filter is efficient (reduces\nto the solution of linear equations) and robust (uneffected by missing data and\nsingular correlations that would cause catastrophic failure of Bayesian\nfilters.) The tracking is so robust, that in some common situations it actually\nperforms better by ignoring error correlations that are so vital to Kalman\nfilters.",

We analyze 18\nyears of continuous observations of the solar acoustic oscillations collected\nby the Sun-as-a-star GOLF instrument onboard the SoHO spacecraft. From the\nfitted mode frequencies, the temporal variability of the frequency shifts of\nthe radial, dipolar, and quadrupolar modes are studied for different frequency\nranges which are sensitive to different layers in the solar sub-surface\ninterior. The low-frequency modes show nearly unchanged frequency shifts\nbetween Cycles 23 and 24, with a time evolving signature of the quasi-biennial\noscillation, which is particularly visible for the quadrupole component\nrevealing the presence of a complex magnetic structure. The modes at higher\nfrequencies show frequency shifts 30% smaller during Cycle~24, which is in\nagreement with the decrease observed in the surface activity between Cycles 23\nand 24. The analysis of 18 years of GOLF oscillations indicates that the\nstructural and magnetic changes responsible for the frequency shifts remained\ncomparable between Cycle 23 and Cycle 24 in the deeper sub-surface layers below\n1400 km as revealed by the low-frequency modes.

These fluctuations are turbulent, in the sense that they are\ndisordered and span a broad range of scales in both space and time. The study\nof solar wind turbulence is motivated by a number of factors all keys to the\nunderstanding of the Solar Wind origin and thermodynamics. The solar wind\nspectral properties are far from uniformity and evolve with the increasing\ndistance from the sun. Most of the available spectra of solar wind turbulence\nwere computed at 1 astronomical unit, while accurate spectra on wide frequency\nranges at larger distances are still few. In this paper we consider solar wind\nspectra derived from the data recorded by the Voyager 2 mission during 1979 at\nabout 5 AU from the sun. Voyager 2 data are an incomplete time series with a\nvoids/signal ratio that typically increases as the spacecraft moves away from\nthe sun (45% missing data in 1979), making the analysis challenging. In order\nto estimate the uncertainty of the spectral slopes, different methods are\ntested on synthetic turbulence signals with the same gap distribution as V2\ndata. Spectra of all variables show a power law scaling with exponents between\n-2.1 and -1.1, depending on frequency subranges.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Heterodyne laser phase measurements in a space-based gravitational wave\ninterferometer are degraded by the phase fluctuations of the onboard clocks,\nresulting in unacceptable sensitivity performance levels of the interferometric\ndata. In order to calibrate out the clock phase noises it has been previously\nsuggested that additional inter-spacecraft phase measurements must be performed\nby modulating the laser beams. This technique, however, considerably increases\nsystem complexity and probability of subsystem failure.\nWith the advent of self-referenced optical frequency combs, it is possible to\ngenerate the heterodyne microwave signal that is coherently referenced to the\nonboard laser. We show in this case that the microwave noise can be cancelled\ndirectly by applying modified second-generation Time-Delay Interferometric\ncombinations to the heterodyne phase measurements. This approach avoids use of\nmodulated laser beams as well as the need of additional ultra-stable oscillator\nclocks.",

By assuming the\nquasi-steady evolution and self-similar expansion, we introduce three types of\nglobal motion into a cylindrical force-free flux rope model, and developed a\nnew velocity-modified model for MCs. The three types of the global motion are\nthe linear propagating motion away from the Sun, the expanding and the poloidal\nmotion with respect to the axis of the MC. The model is applied to 72 MCs\nobserved by Wind spacecraft to investigate the properties of the plasma motion\nof MCs. First, we find that some MCs had a significant propagation velocity\nperpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting the direct evidence of the\nCME's deflected propagation and/or rotation in interplanetary space. Second, we\nconfirm the previous results that the expansion speed is correlated with the\nradial propagation speed and most MCs did not expand self-similarly at 1 AU. In\nour statistics, about 62\\%/17\\% of MCs underwent a under/over-expansion at 1 AU\nand the expansion rate is about 0.6 on average. Third, most interestingly, we\nfind that a significant poloidal motion did exist in some MCs. Three\nspeculations about the cause of the poloidal motion are therefore proposed.\nThese findings advance our understanding of the MC's properties at 1 AU as well\nas the dynamic evolution of CMEs from the Sun to interplanetary space.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The measure of the third-order structure function, Y, is employed in the\nsolar wind to compute the cascade rate of turbulence. In the absence of a mean\nfield B0=0, Y is expected to be isotropic (radial) and independent of the\ndirection of increments, so its measure yields directly the cascade rate. For\nturbulence with mean field, as in the solar wind, Y is expected to become more\ntwo dimensional (2D), that is, to have larger perpendicular components, loosing\nthe above simple symmetry. To get the cascade rate one should compute the flux\nof Y, which is not feasible with single-spacecraft data, thus measurements rely\nupon assumptions about the unknown symmetry. We use direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to characterize the\nanisotropy of Y. We find that for strong guide field B0=5 the degree of\ntwo-dimensionalization depends on the relative importance of shear and pseudo\npolarizations (the two components of an Alfv\u00e9n mode in incompressible MHD).\nThe anisotropy also shows up in the inertial range. The more Y is 2D, the more\nthe inertial range extent differs along parallel and perpendicular directions.\nWe finally test the two methods employed in observations and find that the\nso-obtained cascade rate may depend on the angle between B0 and the direction\nof increments. Both methods yield a vanishing cascade rate along the parallel\ndirection, contrary to observations, suggesting a weaker anisotropy of solar\nwind turbulence compared to our DNS. This could be due to a weaker mean field\nand/or to solar wind expansion.",

Ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of asteroid\n(4) Vesta have suggested the presence of olivine on the surface. These\nobservations were reinforced by the discovery of olivine-rich HED meteorites\nfrom Vesta in recent years. However, analysis of data from NASA's Dawn\nspacecraft has shown that this olivine-bearing unit is actually impact melt in\nthe ejecta of Oppia crater. The lack of widespread mantle olivine, exposed\nduring the formation of the 19 km deep Rheasilvia basin on Vesta's South Pole,\nfurther complicated this picture. Ammannito et al., (2013a) reported the\ndiscovery of local scale olivine-rich units in the form of excavated material\nfrom the mantle using the Visible and InfraRed spectrometer (VIR) on Dawn. Here\nwe explore alternative sources for the olivine in the northern hemisphere of\nVesta by reanalyzing the data from the VIR instrument using laboratory spectral\nmeasurements of meteorites. We suggest that these olivine exposures could be\nexplained by the delivery of olivine-rich exogenic material. Based on our\nspectral band parameters analysis, the lack of correlation between the location\nof these olivine-rich terrains and possible mantle-excavating events, and\nsupported by observations of HED meteorites, we propose that a probable source\nfor olivine seen in the northern hemisphere are remnants of impactors made of\nolivine-rich meteorites.

The model indicates that Enceladus' ocean is\na Na-Cl-CO3 solution with an alkaline pH of ~11-12. The dominance of aqueous\nNaCl is a feature that Enceladus' ocean shares with terrestrial seawater, but\nthe ubiquity of dissolved Na2CO3 suggests that soda lakes are more analogous to\nthe Enceladus ocean. The high pH implies that the hydroxide ion should be\nrelatively abundant, while divalent metals should be present at low\nconcentrations owing to buffering by clays and carbonates on the ocean floor.\nThe high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of\nchondritic rock, as predicted by prior geochemical reaction path models;\nalthough degassing of CO2 from the ocean may also play a role depending on the\nefficiency of mixing processes in the ocean. Serpentinization leads to the\ngeneration of H2, a geochemical fuel that can support both abiotic and\nbiological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected\nin Enceladus' plume. Serpentinization and H2 generation should have occurred on\nEnceladus, like on the parent bodies of aqueously altered meteorites; but it is\nunknown whether these critical processes are still taking place, or if\nEnceladus' rocky core has been completely altered by past hydrothermal\nactivity. The high pH also suggests that the delivery of oxidants from the\nsurface to the ocean has not been significant, and the rocky core did not\nexperience partial melting and igneous differentiation. On the other hand, the\npH is compatible with life as we know it; life on Earth may have begun under\nsimilar conditions, and serpentinites on Earth support microbial communities\nthat are centered on H2 that is provided by water-rock reactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Earth's magnetosphere is formed as a consequence of interaction between\nthe planet's magnetic field and the solar wind, a continuous plasma stream from\nthe Sun. A number of different solar wind phenomena have been studied over the\npast forty years with the intention of understanding and forecasting solar\nbehavior. One of these phenomena in particular, Earth-bound interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs), can significantly disturb the Earth's\nmagnetosphere for a short time and cause geomagnetic storms. This publication\npresents a mission concept consisting of six spacecraft that are equally spaced\nin a heliocentric orbit at 0.72 AU. These spacecraft will monitor the plasma\nproperties, the magnetic field's orientation and magnitude, and the\n3D-propagation trajectory of CMEs heading for Earth. The primary objective of\nthis mission is to increase space weather (SW) forecasting time by means of a\nnear real-time information service, that is based upon in-situ and remote\nmeasurements of the aforementioned CME properties. The mission's secondary\nobjective is to provide vital data to update scientific models. In-situ\nmeasurements are performed using a Solar Wind Analyzer instrumentation package\nand flux gate magnetometers, while coronagraphs execute remote measurements.\nCommunication with the six identical spacecraft is realized via a deep space\nnetwork consisting of six ground stations. They provide an information service\nthat is in uninterrupted contact with the spacecraft, allowing for continuous\nSW monitoring. The data will be handled by a dedicated processing center before\nbeing forwarded to the SSA Space Weather Coordination Center who will manage\nthe SW forecasting. The data processing center will additionally archive the\ndata for the scientific community. The proposed concept mission allows for\nmajor advances in SW forecasting time and the scientific modelling of SW.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The light curves of 2768 stars with effective temperatures and surface\ngravities placing them near the gamma Doradus/delta Scuti instability region\nwere observed as part of the Kepler Guest Observer program from Cycles 1\nthrough 5. The light curves were analyzed in a uniform manner to search for\ngamma Doradus, delta Scuti, and hybrid star pulsations. The gamma Doradus,\ndelta Scuti, and hybrid star pulsations extend asteroseismology to stars\nslightly more massive (1.4 to 2.5 solar masses) than our Sun. We find 207 gamma\nDoradus, 84 delta Scuti, and 32 hybrid candidate stars. Many of these stars are\ncooler than the red edge of the gamma Doradus instability strip as determined\nfrom ground-based observations made before Kepler. A few of our gamma Doradus\ncandidate stars lie on the hot side of the ground-based gamma Doradus\ninstability strip. The hybrid candidate stars cover the entire region between\n6200 K and the blue edge of the ground-based delta Scuti instability strip.\nNone of our candidate stars are hotter than the hot edge of the ground-based\ndelta Scuti instability strip. Our discoveries, coupled with the work of\nothers, shows that Kepler has discovered over 2000 gamma Doradus, delta Scuti,\nand hybrid star candidates in the 116 square degree Kepler field of view. We\nfound relatively few variable stars fainter than magnitude 15, which may be\nbecause they are far enough away to lie between spiral arms in our Galaxy,\nwhere there would be fewer stars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  On 14 October 2014 the Sun Watcher with Active Pixels and Image Processing\n(SWAP) EUV solar telescope on-board the Project for On-Board Autonomy 2\n(PROBA2) spacecraft observed an eruption that led to the formation of perhaps\nthe largest post-eruptive loop system seen in the solar corona in solar cycle\n24. The initial eruption occurred at about 18:30 UT on 14 October, behind the\nEast Solar limb, and was observed as a a coronal mass ejection and an M2.2\nsolar flare. In the 48 hours following the eruption, the associated\npost-eruptive loops grew to a height of approximately 400000 km (>0.5\nsolar-radii) at rates between 2-6 km/s. We conclude from our observations of\nthis event that ordinary post-eruptive loops and so-called post-flare giant\narches are fundamentally the same and are formed by the same magnetic\nreconnection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In our 2013 Astronomical Review article, we discussed the statistics of\nvariability for 633 faint spectral type A-F stars observed by the Kepler\nspacecraft during Quarters 6-13. We found six stars that showed no variability\nwith amplitude 20 ppm or greater in the range 0.2 to 24.4 cycles/day, but whose\npositions in the log g--Teff diagram place them in the delta Sct or gamma Dor\npulsation instability regions established from pre-Kepler ground-based\nobservations. Here we present results for 2137 additional stars observed during\nQuarters 14-17, and find 34 stars that lie within the instability regions. In\nPaper I, we included a +229 K offset to the Kepler Input Catalog Teff to take\ninto account an average systematic difference between the KIC values and the\nTeff derived from SDSS color photometry for main-sequence F stars (Pinsonneault\net al. 2012). Here we compare the KIC Teff value and the Teff derived from\nspectroscopy taken by the LAMOST instrument (Molenda-Zakowicz et al. 2013,\n2014) for 54 stars common to both samples. We find no trend to support applying\nthe offset, but instead find that a small average temperature decrease relative\nto the KIC Teff may be more appropriate for the stars in our spectral-type\nrange. If the offset is omitted, only 17 of our 34 `constant' stars fall within\nthe instability regions. For the two `constant' stars also observed by LAMOST,\nthe LAMOST Teff values are cooler than the KIC Teff by several hundred K, and\nwould move these stars out of the instability regions. It is possible that a\nmore accurate determination of their Teff and log g would move some of the\nother `constant' stars out of the instability regions. However, if average\n(random) errors in Teff are taken into account, 15 to 52 stars may still\npersist within the instability regions. Explanations for these `constant'\nstars, both theoretical and observational, remain to be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The first discoveries of exoplanets around Sun-like stars have fueled efforts\nto find ever smaller worlds evocative of Earth and other terrestrial planets in\nthe Solar System. While gas-giant planets appear to form preferentially around\nmetal-rich stars, small planets (with radii less than four Earth radii) can\nform under a wide range of metallicities. This implies that small, including\nEarth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's\nhistory when metals were far less abundant. We report Kepler spacecraft\nobservations of KOI-3158, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of\nthe Galactic thick disk, which hosts five planets with sizes between Mercury\nand Venus. We used asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of\n11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that KOI-3158 formed when the\nUniverse was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest known\nsystem of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have\nformed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history, providing\nscope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.",
