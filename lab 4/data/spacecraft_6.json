This problem for\npaths in a central force field is known as Lambert's problem. Although this is\nan old problem, we take a new approach. Given two points in the plane, we\nproduce the conic parameters for all conic paths between these points. For a\ngiven central force gravitational parameter, the travel time between the launch\nand destination points is computed along with the initial and final velocities\nfor each transfer conic.

Of the two ICMEs,\nthe first one propagated relatively self-similarly, while the second one\nunderwent significant changes in its properties. We focus on the presence or\nabsence of large-scale corotating structures in the ICME propagation space\nbetween Mercury and 1 AU, that have been shown to influence the orientation of\nICME magnetic structures and the properties of ICME sheaths. We determine the\nflux rope orientation at the two locations using force-free flux rope fits as\nwell as the classification by Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2019). We also use\nmeasurements of plasma properties at 1 AU, the size evolution of the sheaths\nand ME with heliocentric distance, and identification of structures in the\npropagation space based on in situ data, remote-sensing observations, and\nsimulations of the steady-state solar wind, to complement our analysis. Results\nindicate that the changes observed in one ICME were likely caused by a stream\ninteraction region, while the ICME exhibiting little change did not interact\nwith any transients between Mercury and 1 AU. This work provides an example of\nhow interactions with corotating structures in the solar wind can induce\nfundamental changes in ICMEs. Our findings can help lay the foundation for\nimproved predictions of ICME properties at 1 AU.",

In particular, we analyse the volume of the volatile content of coma\nparticles, along with a search for possible dependencies between the nude gauge\ndetection rate (i.e. the rate at which icy particles are detected by the nude\ngauge) and the position of the Rosetta spacecraft. We also investigate the\ncorrelations of the nude gauge detection rate with the quantities associated\nwith cometary activity.\nAlthough it was not originally designed for such a purpose, the COPS nude\ngauge has been able to detect $\\sim$67000 features generated by the sublimation\nof the volatile content of icy particles. The nude gauge detection rate follows\na trend that is inversely proportional to the heliocentric distance. This\nresult is interpreted as a confirmation of a possible relation between the nude\ngauge detection rate and cometary activity. Thus, we compared the former with\nparameters related to cometary activity and obtained significant correlations,\nindicating that the frequency of icy particle detection is driven by cometary\nactivity.

This configuration may include\nspatially localized maxima of the curvature radius at equator (due to localized\nhumps of the equatorial magnetic field magnitude) that reduce the energetic\nparticle scattering and precipitation. Therefore, the measured precipitation\npatterns are related to the spatial distribution of the equatorial curvature\nradius that is determined by the magnetotail current sheet configuration.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The structure of the icy shells of ocean worlds is important for\nunderstanding the stability of their underlying oceans as it controls the rate\nat which heat can be transported outward and radiated to space. Future\nspacecraft exploration of the ocean worlds (e.g., by NASA's Europa Clipper\nmission) will allow for higher-resolution measurements of gravity and shape\nthan currently available.\nIn this paper, we study the sensitivity of gravity-topography admittance to\nthe structure of icy shells in preparation for future data analysis. An\nanalytical viscous relaxation model is used to predict admittance spectra given\ndifferent shell structures determined by the temperature-dependent viscosity of\na tidally heated, conductive shell. We apply these methods to the ocean worlds\nof Europa and Enceladus. We find that admittance is sensitive to the mechanisms\nof topography support at different wavelengths and estimate the required\ngravity performance to resolve transitions between these mechanisms. We find\nthat the Airy isostatic model is unable to accurately describe admittance\nuniversally across all wavelengths when the shell thickness is a significant\nfraction of body's radius. Our models suggest that measurements of admittance\nat low spherical harmonic degrees are more sensitive to thick shells with high\ntidal dissipation, and may complement ice-penetrating radar measurements in\nconstraining shell thickness. Finally, we find that admittance may be used to\nconstrain the tidal dissipation within the icy shell, which would be\ncomplementary to a more demanding measurement of the tidal phase lag.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Although spectral surveys and spacecraft missions provide information on\nsmall bodies, many important analyses can only be performed in terrestrial\nlaboratories. For now, the total number of parent bodies represented in our\nmeteorites collection is estimated to about 150 parent bodies, of which 50\nparent bodies represented by the poorly studied ungrouped chondrites. Linking\nungrouped meteorites to their parent bodies is thus crucial to significantly\nincrease our knowledge of asteroids. To this end, the petrography of 25\nungrouped chondrites and rare meteorite groups was studied, allowing grouping\ninto 6 petrographic groups based on texture, mineralogy, and aqueous and\nthermal parent body processing. Then, we acquired visible-near-infrared\nreflectance spectroscopy data, in order to compare them to ground-based\ntelescopic observations of asteroids. The reflectance spectra of meteorites\nwere obtained on powdered samples, raw samples and polished sections. Our\nresults showed that sample preparation influences the shape of the spectra, and\nthus asteroid spectral matching, especially for carbonaceous chondrites.\nOverall, the petrographic groups defined initially coincide with reflectance\nspectral groups. We define links between some of the studied ungrouped\nchondrites and asteroid types that had no meteorite connection proposed before,\nsuch as some very primitive type 3.00 ungrouped chondrites to B-type or Cg-type\nasteroids. We also matched metamorphosed ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites to\nS-complex asteroids, suggesting that this complex is not only composed of\nordinary chondrites or primitive achondrites, as previously established, but\nmay also host carbonaceous chondrites. Conversely, some ungrouped chondrites\ncould not be matched to any known asteroid type, showing that those are\npotential samples from yet unidentified asteroid types.",

As a novel secrecy\nsource, the spacecrafts utilize Doppler frequency shift based measurements. In\nthis way, the mobilities of the communication devices are exploited to generate\nsecret keys, where this resource can be utilized in the environments that the\nchannel fading based key generation methods are not available. The mobility of\na spacecraft is modeled as the superposition of a pre-determined component and\na dynamic component. We derive the maximum achievable secret key generation\nrate from the Doppler frequency shift. The proposed secret key generation\nprocedure extracts the Doppler frequency shift in the form of nominal power\nspectral density samples (NPSDS). We propose a maximum-likelihood (ML)\nestimation for the NPSDS at the spacecrafts, then a uniform quantizer is\nutilized to obtain secret key bits. The key disagreement rate (KDR) is\nanalytically obtained for the proposed key generation procedure. Through\nnumerical studies, the tightness of the provided approximations is shown.

While the large scale morphology is well\nunderstood, the impact of variations in coronal properties on the scale of a\nfew degrees on properties of the interplanetary medium is not known. Solar\nOrbiter, carrying both remote sensing and in situ instruments into the inner\nsolar system, is intended to make these connections better than ever before.\nAims. We combine remote sensing and in situ measurements from Solar Orbiter's\nfirst perihelion at 0.5 AU to study the fine scale structure of the solar wind\nfrom the equatorward edge of a polar coronal hole with the aim of identifying\ncharacteristics of the corona which can explain the in situ variations.\nMethods. We use in situ measurements of the magnetic field, density and solar\nwind speed to identify structures on scales of hours at the spacecraft. Using\nPotential Field Source Surface mapping we estimate the source locations of the\nmeasured solar wind as a function of time and use EUI images to characterise\nthese solar sources. Results. We identify small scale stream interactions in\nthe solar wind with compressed magnetic field and density along with speed\nvariations which are associated with corrugations in the edge of the coronal\nhole on scales of several degrees, demonstrating that fine scale coronal\nstructure can directly influence solar wind properties and drive variations\nwithin individual streams. Conclusions. This early analysis already\ndemonstrates the power of Solar Orbiter's combined remote sensing and in situ\npayload and shows that with future, closer perihelia it will be possible\ndramatically to improve our knowledge of the coronal sources of fine scale\nsolar wind structure, which is important both for understanding the phenomena\ndriving the solar wind and predicting its impacts at the Earth and elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Dual-Frequency synthetic aperture radar (DFSAR) system manifested on the\nChandrayaan-2 spacecraft represents a significant step forward in radar\nexploration of solid solar system objects. It combines SAR at two wavelengths\n(L- and S-bands) and multiple resolutions with several polarimetric modes in\none lightweight ($\\sim$ 20 kg) package. The resulting data from DFSAR support\ncalculation of the 2$\\times$2 complex scattering matrix for each resolution\ncell, which enables lunar near surface characterization in terms of radar\npolarization properties at different wavelengths and incidence angles. In this\npaper, we report on the calibration and preliminary performance\ncharacterization of DFSAR data based on the analysis of a sample set of crater\nregions on the Moon. Our calibration analysis provided a means to compare\non-orbit performance with pre-launch measurements and the results matched with\nthe pre-launch expected values. Our initial results show that craters in both\npermanently shadowed regions (PSRs) and non-PSRs that are classified as\nCircular Polarization Ratio (CPR)-anomalous in previous S-band radar analyses\nappear anomalous at L-band also. We also observe that material evolution and\nphysical properties at their interior and proximal ejecta are decoupled. For\nByrgius C crater region, we compare our analysis of dual-frequency radar data\nwith the predicted behaviours of theoretical scattering models. If crater age\nestimates are available, comparison of their radar polarization properties at\nmultiple wavelengths similar to that of the three unnamed south polar crater\nregions shown in this study may provide new insights into how the rockiness of\ncraters evolves with time.",

Metis is devoted to carry out the\nfirst simultaneous imaging of the solar corona in both visible light (VL) and\nultraviolet (UV). High-energy particles penetrate spacecraft materials and may\nlimit the performance of on-board instruments. A study of galactic cosmic-ray\n(GCR) tracks observed in the first VL images gathered by Metis during the\ncommissioning phase for a total of 60 seconds of exposure time is presented\nhere. A similar analysis is planned for the UV channel. A prediction of the GCR\nflux up to hundreds of GeV is made here for the first part of the Solar Orbiter\nmission to study the Metis coronagraph performance. GCR model predictions are\ncompared to observations gathered on board Solar Orbiter by the EPD/HET\nexperiment in the range 10 MeV-100 MeV in the summer 2020 and with previous\nmeasurements. Estimated cosmic-ray fluxes above 70 MeV n$^{-1}$ have been also\nparameterized and used for Monte Carlo simulations aiming at reproducing the\ncosmic-ray track observations in the Metis coronagraph VL images. The same\nparameterizations can also be used to study the performance of other detectors.\nBy comparing observations of cosmic-ray tracks in the Metis VL images with\nFLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of cosmic-ray interactions in the VL detector, it\nis found that cosmic rays fire a fraction of the order of 10$^{-4}$ of the\nwhole image pixel sample. Therefore, cosmic rays do not affect sensibly the\nquality of Metis VL images. It is also found that the overall efficiency for\ncosmic-ray identification in the Metis VL images is approximately equal to the\ncontribution of Z$>$2 particles. As a result, the Metis coronagraph may play\nthe role of a proton monitor for long-term GCR variations during the overall\nmission duration.",

Here, I assess potential sources of lunar carbon based on previous\nwork focused on polar water ice. A simplified model is used to estimate the\ntemperature-dependent Carbon Content of Ices at the lunar poles, and this is\ncombined with remote sensing data to estimate the total amount of carbon and\ngenerate a Carbon Favorability Index that highlights promising deposits for\nfuture ground-based prospecting. Hotspots in the index maps are identified, and\nnearby staging areas are analyzed using quantitative models of trafficability\nand solar irradiance. Overall, the Moon is extremely poor in carbon sources\ncompared to more abundant and readily accessible options at Mars. However, a\nhandful of polar regions may contain appreciable amounts of subsurface\ncarbon-bearing ices that could serve as a rich source in the near term, but\nwould be easily exhausted on longer timescales. Four of those regions were\nfound to have safe nearby staging areas with equatorial-like illumination at a\nmodest height above the surface. Any one of these sites could yield enough C, H\nand O to produce propellant for hundreds of refuelings of a large spacecraft.\nOther potential lunar carbon sources including bulk regolith and pyroclastic\nglasses are less viable due to their low carbon concentrations.",

This suggests that rotation-induced deformation of asteroids through\nrotational spinup produces top shapes. Although some previous simulations using\nthe Discrete Element Method showed that spinup of rubble piles may produce\noblate top shapes, it is still unclear what kinds of conditions such as\nfriction angles of constituent materials and spinup timescales are required for\ntop-shape formation. Here we show, through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\nsimulations of granular bodies spinning-up at different rates, that the\nrotation-induced deformation of spherical rubble piles before breakup can be\nclassified into three modes according to the friction angle \\phi_{d}:\nquasi-static and internal deformation for \\phi_{d} < 40 degrees, dynamical and\ninternal deformation for 50 degrees < \\phi_{d} < 60 degrees, and surface\nlandslides for \\phi_{d} > 70 degrees. Note that these apparent large values of\nfriction angle can be acceptable if we consider the effect of cohesion among\nblocks of a rubble pile under weak gravity. Bodies with \\phi_{d} < 60 degrees\nevolve into oblate spheroids through internal deformation, but never form\npronounced equators defining a top shape. In contrast, bodies with \\phi_{d} >\n70 degrees deform into axisymmetric top shapes through an axisymmetric surface\nlandslides if spinup timescales are < a few days. In addition, through slow\nspinups with timescales > 1 month, bodies with \\phi_{d} > 70 degrees deform\ninto non-axisymmetric shapes via localized landslides. We suggest that rapid\nspinup mechanisms are preferable for the formation of axisymmetric top shapes.",

On average\nMercury is subjected to a $50\\times$ larger mass flux and generates $700\\times$\nmore ejecta than Ceres, while the lunar mass flux is $10\\times$ larger, and the\nejecta generation is $30\\times$ larger than on Ceres. For these reasons, we\nfind that meteoroid impacts are an unlikely candidate for the production of a\nwater exosphere or significant excavation of surface features. The surface\nturnover rate from the micro-meteoroid populations considered is estimated to\nbe $1.25$ Myr on Ceres.",

The aim of this paper is to determine for the\nfirst time the rotation periods of a number of asteroids observed by the Kepler\nsatellite during the K2 Campaign 9. Using publicly available data from Kepler\nmission we have used the Modified Causal Pixel Model (MCPM) code to perform the\naperture-like and PRF-like photometry of 1026 asteroids. The results allowed us\nto determine the rotation periods for 188 asteroids. For asteroids with\nrotation periods previously measured, we compared the results and found very\ngood agreement. There are additional 20 asteroids for which we obtained lower\nlimits on rotation periods and in all cases these limits are at least 100 h.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The multi-scale flow mechanism is crucial for force and heat loaded on\nnear-space and reentry vehicles, the control of spacecraft by thrusters, the\npropelling and cooling of MEMS, etc. Since the continuum flow and rarefied flow\noften exist simultaneously, the modeling and prediction for such a multi-scale\nflow field is very complicated. One important and efficient way of predicting\nthe multi-scale flow is constructing numerical methods by adapting the\nmulti-scale properties of the temporal integral solutions (or equivalent\ncharacteristic line solutions) for the model equations in the gas-kinetic\ntheory. The model equations can be classified into FP-type and BGK-type, and\nthe numerical methods can have deterministic form or stochastic particle form.\nSince these numerical methods are strictly based on model equations, they are\nalso restricted by the model equations. The difficulty and complexity in\nconstructing model equation that has complete asymptotic preserving property\nfor gas mixture with non-equilibrium internal energy will prevent the further\nextension of these methods. Therefore, this paper addresses the question\nwhether a multi-scale numerical method can be established not on the model\nequations, but directly adapts the relaxation rates of macroscopic variables\nsuch as stress and heat flux. Since the algorithm of multi-scale particle\nmethod based on BGK-type equation is clear and simple, its collision step is\nmodified in this work, where the macroscopic variables firstly evolve according\nto their relaxation rates, and then the molecules that participate in\ninter-molecular collisions get their after-collision velocities from the\nafter-evolution macroscopic variables. Therefore, this direct relaxation\nprocess does not depend on the model equations anymore. Finally, the validity\nand accuracy of the particle method with direct relaxation process are examined\nwith five test cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The magnetospheres of the outer planets exhibit turbulent phenomena in an\nenvironment which is qualitatively different compared to the solar wind or the\ninterstellar medium. The key differences are the finite sizes of the\nmagnetospheres limited by their physical boundaries, the presence of a strong\nplanetary background magnetic field and spatially very inhomogeneous plasma\nproperties within the magnetospheres. Typical turbulent fluctuations possess\namplitudes much smaller than the background field and are characterized by\nAlfv\u00e9n times, which can be smaller than the non-linear interaction time\nscales. The magnetospheres of the outer planets are thus interesting\nlaboratories of plasma turbulence. In Jupiter's and Saturn's magnetospheres,\nturbulence is well established thanks to the in-situ measurements by several\nspacecraft, in particular by the Galileo and Cassini orbiter. In contrast, the\nfluctuations in Uranus' and Neptune's magnetospheres are poorly understood due\nto the lack of sufficient data. Turbulence in the outer planets' magnetospheres\nhave important effects on the systems as a whole. The dissipation of the\nturbulent fluctuations through wave-particle interaction is a significant heat\nsource, which can explain the large magnetospheric plasma temperatures.",

One of these initiatives is\nthe Cubesats Applied for MEasuring and LOcalising Transients (CAMELOT) mission\nconcept, aimed at detecting and localizing gamma-ray bursts with an efficiency\nand accuracy comparable to large gamma-ray space observatories. While precise\nattitude control is not necessary for such a mission, attitude determination is\nan important issue in the interpretation of scintillator detector data as well\nas optimizing downlink telemetry. The employment of star trackers is not always\na viable option for such small satellites, hence another alternative is\nnecessary.\nA new method is proposed in this series of papers, utilizing thermal imaging\nsensors to provide simultaneous measurement of the attitude of the Sun and the\nhorizon by employing a homogeneous array of such detectors. The combination\nwith Sun and horizon detection w.r.t. the spacecraft would allow the full 3-DoF\nrecovery of its attitude. In this paper we determine the spherical projection\nfunction of the MLX90640 infrasensors planned to be used for this purpose. We\napply a polynomial transformation with radial corrections to map the spatial\ncoordinates to the sensor plane.

We have performed\nexperiments varying the physical parameters listed above (e.g., gravity was\nvaried in reduced gravity aircraft flights).

Videography captures the\nerosion and scour hole formation processes, and analysis of these videos\npost-test identifies the scaling of these processes.

Based on these insights, we\nhave developed an erosion rate model that can be applied to generalized\nsituations, such as the erosion of soil beneath a horizontal gas flow on a\nplanetary surface. This is important to lunar exploration because the rate of\nerosion beneath the rocket exhaust plume of a landing spacecraft will determine\nthe amount of sand-blasting damage that can be inflicted upon surrounding\nhardware. Although the rocket exhaust plume at the exit of the nozzle is\nsupersonic, the boundary layer on the lunar surface where erosion occurs is\nsubsonic.

We\ninvestigate the capabilities of RPW in terms of interplanetary dust studies and\npresent the first analysis of dust impacts recorded by this instrument. We\ndiscuss previously developed models of voltage pulses generation after a dust\nimpact onto a spacecraft and present the relevant technical parameters for\nSolar Orbiter RPW as a dust detector. Then we present the statistical analysis\nof the dust impacts recorded by RPW/TDS from April 20th, 2020 to February 27th,\n2021 between 0.5 AU and 1 AU. The study shows that the dust population studied\npresents a radial velocity component directed outward from the Sun, the order\nof magnitude of which can be roughly estimated as $v_{r, dust} \\simeq 50$\nkm.$s^{-1}$. This is consistent with the flux of impactors being dominated by\n$\\beta$-meteoroids. We estimate the cumulative flux of these grains at 1 AU to\nbe roughly $F_\\beta \\simeq 8\\times 10^{-5} $ m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, for particles of\nradius $r \\gtrsim 100$ nm. The power law index $\\delta$ of the cumulative mass\nflux of the impactors is evaluated by two differents methods (direct\nobservations of voltage pulses and indirect effect on the impact rate\ndependency on the impact speed). Both methods give a result $\\delta \\simeq\n0.3-0.4$. Solar Orbiter RPW proves to be a suitable instrument for\ninterplanetary dust studies.

The goal of this mission was to conduct proximity operations\nincluding remote sensing observations, material sampling, and a Small Carry-On\nImpact experiment, as well as sample analyses. As of September 2020, the\nspacecraft is on the way back to Earth with samples from Ryugu with no critical\nissues after the successful departure in November 2019. Here, we propose an\nextended mission in which the spacecraft will rendezvous with a small asteroid\nwith ~30 m - ~40 m in diameter that is rotating at a spin period of ~10 min\nafter an additional ~10-year cruise phase. We introduce that two scenarios are\nsuitable for the extended mission. In the first scenario, the spacecraft will\nperform swing-by maneuvers at Venus once and Earth twice to arrive at asteroid\n2001 AV43. In the second scenario, it will perform swing-by maneuvers at Earth\ntwice to reach asteroid 1998 KY26. In both scenarios, the mission will continue\nuntil the early 2030s. JAXA recently released the decision that the spacecraft\nwill rendezvous with 1998 KY26. This paper focuses on our scientific\nassessments of the two scenarios but leaves the decision process to go to 1998\nKY26 for future reports. Rendezvous operations will be planned to detail the\nphysical properties and surrounding environments of the target, one of the\nsmallest elements of small planetary bodies. By achieving the planned\noperations, the mission will provide critical hints on the violent histories of\ncollisions and accumulations of small bodies in the solar system.

The physical origin of such magnetic field bends, the\nconditions for their survival across the interplanetary space, and their\nrelation to solar wind rotation are yet to be clearly understood. We traced\nmeasured solar wind flows from the spacecraft position down to the surface of\nthe Sun to identify their potential source regions and used a global MHD model\nof the corona and solar wind to relate them to the rotational state of the low\nsolar corona. We identified regions of the solar corona for which solar wind\nspeed and rotational shear are important and long-lived, that can be favourable\nto the development of magnetic deflections and to their propagation across\nextended heights in the solar wind. We show that coronal rotation is highly\nstructured and that enhanced flow shear develops near the boundaries between\ncoronal holes and streamers, around and above pseudo-streamers, even when such\nboundaries are aligned with the direction of solar rotation. A large fraction\nof the switchbacks identified by PSP map back to these regions, both in terms\nof instantaneous magnetic field connectivity and of the trajectories of wind\nstreams that reach the spacecraft. These regions of strong shears are likely to\nleave an imprint on the solar wind over large distances and to increase the\ntransverse speed variability in the slow solar wind. The simulations and\nconnectivity analysis suggest they can be a source of the switchbacks and\nspikes observed by Parker Solar Probe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Remote and in-situ observations of cometary gases have revealed the presence\nof a wealth of complex organic molecules, including carbon chains, alcohols,\nimines and the amino acid glycine. Such chemical complexity in cometary\nmaterial implies that impacts by comets could have supplied reagents for\nprebiotic chemistry to young planetary surfaces. However, the assumption that\nsome of the molecules observed in cometary comae at millimetre wavelengths\noriginate from ices stored inside the nucleus has not yet been proven. In fact,\nthe comae of moderately-active comets reach sufficient densities within a few\nthousand kilometers of the nucleus for an active (solar radiation-driven)\nphotochemistry to ensue. Here we present results from our latest\nchemical-hydrodynamic models incorporating an updated reaction network, and\nshow that the commonly-observed HC3N (cyanoacetylene) and NH2CHO (formamide)\nmolecules can be efficiently produced in cometary comae as a result of\ntwo-body, neutral-neutral, gas-phase reactions involving well-known coma gases.\nIn the presence of a near-nucleus distributed source of CN (similar to that\nobserved by the Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P), we find that sufficient\nHC$_3$N and NH2CHO can be synthesized to match the abundances of these\nmolecules in previous observations of Oort Cloud comets. The precise origin of\nthese (and other) complex organic molecules in cometary comae can be verified\nthrough interferometric mapping observations, for example, using the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).",

However, flyby in 2029 will be an opportunity to conduct an\ninternal geophysical study and test the current hypothesis on the effects of\ntidal forces on asteroids. The Earth-Apophis mission is driven by additional\nfactors and scientific goals beyond the unique opportunity for natural\nexperimentation. However, the internal geophysical structures remain largely\nunknown. Understanding the strength and internal integrity of asteroids is not\njust a matter of scientific curiosity. It is a practical imperative to advance\nknowledge for planetary defense against the possibility of an asteroid impact.\nThis paper presents a conceptual robotics system required for efficiency at\nevery stage from entry to post-landing and for asteroid monitoring. In short,\nasteroid surveillance missions are futuristic frontiers, with the potential for\ntechnological growth that could revolutionize space exploration. Advanced space\ntechnologies and robotic systems are needed to minimize risk and prepare these\ntechnologies for future missions. A neural network model is implemented to\ntrack and predict asteroids' orbits. Advanced algorithms are also needed to\nnumerically predict orbital events to minimize error",

Its main advantage is the fast approximation of\nthe aerodynamics of spacecraft in the lower end of the low-Earth orbit altitude\nrange. It is a novel implementation of a panel method, where the body is\nrepresented as a set of fundamental elements and the sum of their individual\naerodynamic properties makes up the properties of the whole. ADBSat's approach\ntreats the shape as a set of flat triangular plates. These are read from a CAD\ngeometry file in the Wavefront format, which can be created with most common\nCAD programs. A choice of gas-surface interaction models is available to\nrepresent the physics of free-molecular flow under different conditions. Its\nmodular design means that other models can be easily and quickly implemented.\nIt also benefits from a new shading algorithm for fast determination of\nelemental flow exposure. The flat plate representation and shading algorithm\nare further employed to determine solar coefficients, again with the ability to\neasily add further solar radiation pressure models as they become available.

It is one of the most extensively studied problems in\ncelestial mechanics and astrodynamics, and, as such, it has always attracted\nthe interest of mathematicians and engineers. Its solution lies at the base of\nalgorithms for, e.g., orbit determination, orbit design (mission planning),\nspace rendezvous and interception, space debris correlation, missile and\nspacecraft targeting. There is abundancy of literature discussing various\napproaches developed over the years to solve Lambert's problem. We have\ncollected more than 70 papers and, of course, the issue is treated in most\nastrodynamics and celestial mechanics textbooks. From our analysis of the\ndocuments, we have been able to identify six or seven main solution methods,\neach associated to a number of revisions and variations, and many, so to say,\nsecondary research lines with little or no posterior development. We have\nascertained plenty of literature with proposed solutions, in many cases\nsupplemented by performance comparisons with other methods. We have reviewed\nand organized the existing bibliography on Lambert's problem and we have\nperformed a quantitative comparison among the existing methods for its\nsolution. The analysis is based on the following issues: choice of the free\nparameter, number of iterations, generality of the mathematical formulation,\nlimits of applicability (degeneracies, domain of the parameter, special cases\nand peculiarities), accuracy, and suitability to automatic execution.\nEventually we have tested the performance of each code. The solvers that\nincorporate the best qualities are Bate's algorithm via universal variables\nwith Newton-Raphson and Izzo's Householder algorithm. The former is the\nfastest, the latter exhibits the best ratio between speed, robustness and\naccuracy.",

In this paper, we present a year-long study of\nelectrostatic fluctuations observed in the solar wind at an interval of\nheliocentric distances from 0.5 to 1~AU. The RPW/TDS observations provide a\nnearly continuous data set for a statistical study of intense waves below the\nlocal plasma frequency. The on-board and continuously collected and processed\nproperties of waveform snapshots allow for the mapping plasma waves at\nfrequencies between 200~Hz and 20~kHz. We used the triggered waveform snapshots\nand a Doppler-shifted solution of the dispersion relation for wave mode\nidentification in order to carry out a detailed spectral and polarization\nanalysis. Electrostatic ion-acoustic waves are the common wave emissions\nobserved between the local electron and proton plasma frequency in the soler\nwind. The occurrence rate of ion-acoustic waves peaks around perihelion at\ndistances of 0.5~AU and decreases with increasing distances, with only a few\nwaves detected per day at 0.9~AU. Waves are more likely to be observed when the\nlocal proton moments and magnetic field are highly variable. A more detailed\nanalysis of more than 10000 triggered waveform snapshots shows the mean wave\nfrequency at about 3 kHz and wave amplitude about 2.5 mV/m. The wave amplitude\nvaries as 1/R^(1.38) with the heliocentric distance. The relative phase\ndistribution between two components of the E-field shows a mostly linear wave\npolarization. Electric field fluctuations are closely aligned with the\ndirections of the ambient field lines. Only a small number (3%) of ion-acoustic\nwaves are observed at larger magnetic discontinuities.",
