The two classes of fluctuations\nconsidered are a high-frequency parallel-propagating wave-like piece and a\nlow-frequency quasi-two-dimensional component. For both components, the\nnonlinear dynamics is dominanted by quasi-perpendicular spectral cascades of\nenergy. Driving of the fluctuations, by, for example, velocity shear and pickup\nions, is included. Numerical solutions to the new model are obtained using the\nCronos framework, and validated against previous simpler models. Comparing\nresults from the new model with spacecraft measurements, we find improved\nagreement relative to earlier models that employ prescribed background solar\nwind fields. Finally, the new results for the wave-like and\nquasi-two-dimensional fluctuations are used to calculate ab initio diffusion\nmean free paths and drift lengthscales for the transport of cosmic rays in the\nturbulent solar wind.",

This question was considered earlier for 824 late-type stars on the basis\nof a consolidated catalogue of the soft X-ray fluxes. We carry out a more\nrefined analysis separately for G, K and M dwarfs. They distinctively exhibit\ntwo modes of activity. The first one is the saturation mode, it is\ncharacteristic of young stars and is practically not related to their rotation.\nThe second one refers to the solar-type activity the level of which strongly\ndepends on the rotation period. We show that the transition from one mode to\nanother takes place at the rotation periods of 1.1, 3.3 and 7.2 days for the\nstars of spectral types G2, K4 and M3 respectively. In the light of the\ndiscovery of superflares on G and K stars on the Kepler spacecraft there arises\na question of how these objects differ from other active late-type stars. We\nanalyse the location of superflare stars relative to the stars observed by\nKepler on the \"amplitude of rotational brightness modulation (ARM) -- rotation\nperiod\" diagram. The value of ARM reflects the relative spots area on a star\nand characterises the activity level in the whole atmosphere. It is shown that\nG and K superflare stars are basically fast rotating young objects, but some of\nthem belong to the stars with the solar type of activity.",

Many studies have presented the typical features\nassociated to the activity of the nucleus, such as localized dust and gas jets.\nHere we report on series of more energetic transient events observed during the\nthree months surrounding the comet's perihelion passage in August 2015.\nWe detected and characterized 34 outbursts with the Rosetta cameras, one\nevery 2.4 nucleus rotation. We identified 3 main dust plume morphologies\nassociated to these events: a narrow jet, a broad fan, and more complex plumes\nfeaturing both previous types together. These plumes are comparable in scale\nand temporal variation to what has been observed on other comets.\nWe present a map of the outbursts source locations, and discuss the\nassociated topography. We find that the spatial distribution sources on the\nnucleus correlates well with morphological region boundaries, especially in\nareas marked by steep scarps or cliffs.\nOutbursts occur either in the early morning or shortly after the local noon,\nindicating two potential processes: Morning outbursts may be triggered by\nthermal stresses linked to the rapid change of temperature, afternoon events\nare most likely related to the diurnal or seasonal heat wave reaching volatiles\nburied under the first surface layer. In addition, we propose that some events\ncan be the result of a completely different mechanism, in which most of the\ndust is released upon the collapse of a cliff.",

These ideas may in the future become candidates for M or L\nclass missions within the ESA Science Program.\nWith the launch of Gaia in December 2013, Europe entered a new era of space\nastrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful Hipparcos mission\nfrom the early 1990s. Gaia is the successor to Hipparcos, both of which\noperated in optical wavelengths, and Gaia is two orders of magnitude more\naccurate in the five astrometric parameters and is surveying four orders of\nmagnitude more stars in a vast volume of the Milky Way. The combination of the\nHipparcos/Tycho-2 catalogues with the first early Gaia data release will give\nimproved proper motions over a long ~25 year baseline. The final Gaia solution\nwill also establish a new optical reference frame by means of quasars, by\nlinking the optical counterparts of radio (VLBI) sources defining the\norientation of the reference frame, and by using the zero proper motion of\nquasars to determine a non-rotating frame.\nA weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However,\nmuch of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain\nstudies, are obscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult\nfor Gaia to deeply probe. Traditionally, this problem is overcome by switching\nto the infra-red but this was not possible with Gaia's CCDs. Additionally, to\nscan the entire sky and make global absolute parallax measurements the\nspacecraft must have a constant rotation and this requires that the CCDs\noperate in TDI mode, increasing their complexity.",

The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data\nprocessing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis\nConsortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013\nand arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the\nSun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft\nand payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission\nstarted with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently\ntransferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia\nand give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016)\nbeing operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload\nmodule, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific\nperformance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning\nactivities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational\nmode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit\noperations.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For near-Sun missions, the spacecraft approaches very close to the Sun and\nspace environmental effects become relevant. Strong restrictions on how much\nclose it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials\ncan stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and\nfunctionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given\nmission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The\ntemperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:\nreflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is\nconsidered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are\nconstant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the\ntemperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the\naerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on\nthe heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical\nproperties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly\nproportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as\n$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the\nsame temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,\neventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun\nwithout compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace\nstructures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of\ncomposite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity -\nare defined.",

The system is perturbed by a\nbiparametric acceleration with components along the tangential and normal\ndirections. A similarity transformation reduces the biparametric disturbance to\na simpler uniparametric forcing along the velocity vector. The solvability\nconditions of this new problem are discussed, and closed-form solutions for the\nintegrable cases are provided. Thanks to the conservation of a generalized\nenergy, the orbits are classified as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic.\nKeplerian orbits appear naturally as particular solutions to the problem. After\ncharacterizing the orbits independently, a unified form of the solution is\nbuilt based on the Weierstrass elliptic functions. The new trajectories involve\nfundamental curves such as cardioids and logarithmic, sinusoidal, and Cotes'\nspirals. These orbits can represent the motion of particles perturbed by solar\nradiation pressure, of spacecraft with continuous thrust propulsion, and some\ninstances of Schwarzschild geodesics.

The aim of this work is to search for the presence of H$_2$O on the\nnucleus which, in general, appears very dark and rich in dehydrated organic\nmaterial. After selecting images of the bright spots which could be good\ncandidates to search for H$_2$O ice, taken at high resolution by OSIRIS, we\ncheck for spectral cubes of the selected coordinates to identify these spots\nobserved by VIRTIS. The selected OSIRIS images were processed with the OSIRIS\nstandard pipeline and corrected for the illumination conditions for each pixel\nusing the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. The spots with higher I/F were selected and\nthen analysed spectrophotometrically and compared with the surrounding area. We\nselected 13 spots as good targets to be analysed by VIRTIS to search for the 2\nmicron absorption band of water ice in the VIRTIS spectral cubes. Out of the 13\nselected bright spots, eight of them present positive H$_2$O ice detection on\nthe VIRTIS data. A spectral analysis was performed and the approximate\ntemperature of each spot was computed. The H$_2$O ice content was confirmed by\nmodeling the spectra with mixing (areal and intimate) of H$_2$O ice and dark\nterrain, using Hapke's radiative transfer modeling. We also present a detailed\nanalysis of the detected spots.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  LISA Pathfinder is the technological demonstrator space mission for the\nfuture gravitational waves observatory in space eLISA, with the aim of measure\nthe differential acceleration between free-falling test masses orbiting in the\nsame apparatus at a level of 30 fm/s-2Hz-1/2 at 1 mHz. Because the satellite\ncan't follow the two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to\nfollow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation force applied to\ncompensate this effect introduces a dominant source of force noise in the\nmission noise budget at frequency near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode\nactuation control scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and\navoid actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic impulses,\nwith test masses in free fall in between two kicks. This actuation-free motion\nis then analyzed for the remaining sources of acceleration ultra noise. A\nfree-fall mode parallel testing has been successfully implemented on torsion\npendulum facility at the University of Trento and the results of the\nmeasurement campaign are ready to be shown and discussed. The implementation of\nthe data analysis algorithms to estimate the spectrum of the acceleration of\nthe controlled test mass, and the estimation of system parameters such as the\nforce gradients, stiffness terms, are also part of this work. The free-fall\nmode has been tested at the level of 2 fNm/Hz-1/2, at the frequencies of 1 mHz,\ncorresponding to an acceleration of about 100 fm /s-2 Hz-1/2. The ground tests\nhave nevertheless allowed to develop and test quantitatively this innovative\nmethod of noise reduction due to actuation noise, contributing to its\ndevelopment for the LISA Pathfinder mission.",

The major finding\nof this article was that through the sublimation of the aggregates of dirty\ngrains (radius a between 5 microm and 50 microm) we were able to completely\nreproduce the radial brightness profile of a jet beyond 4 km from the nucleus.\nTo reproduce the data we needed to inject a number of aggregates between 8.5 x\n$10^{13}$ and 8.5 x $10^{10}$ for a = 5 microm and 50 microm respectively, or\nan initial mass of $H_2O$ ice around 22kg.",

As such, the data only give a partial view of\ntheir 3D structures. By studying a large number of ICMEs, crossed at different\ndistances from their apex, we develop statistical methods to obtain a\nquantitative generic 3D shape of ICMEs. In a first approach we theoretically\nobtain the expected statistical distribution of the shock-normal orientation\nfrom assuming simple models of 3D shock shapes, including distorted profiles,\nand compare their compatibility with observed distributions. In a second\napproach we use the shock normal and the flux rope axis orientations, as well\nas the impact parameter, to provide statistical information across the\nspacecraft trajectory. The study of different 3D shock models shows that the\nobservations are compatible with a shock symmetric around the Sun-apex line as\nwell as with an asymmetry up to an aspect ratio around 3. Moreover, flat or\ndipped shock surfaces near their apex can only be rare cases. Next, the sheath\nthickness and the ICME velocity have no global trend along the ICME front.\nFinally, regrouping all these new results and the ones of our previous\narticles, we provide a quantitative ICME generic 3D shape, including the global\nshape of the shock, the sheath and the flux rope. The obtained quantitative\ngeneric ICME shape will have implications for several aims. For example, it\nconstrains the output of typical ICME numerical simulations. It is also a base\nto develop deeper studies of the transport of high energy solar and cosmic\nparticles during an ICME propagation, as well as for modeling and forecasting\nspace weather conditions near Earth.",

Data collected at\ndifferent epochs and latitudes show evidence of short and medium timescale\nvariability as well as latitudinal differences. Spatial and temporal\nvariability is also predicted in mesospheric and thermosphere terminator models\nwith lower boundary conditions at 70 km near cloud tops. The Venus transit on\nJune 5-6 2012 was the first to occur with a spacecraft in orbit around Venus.\nIt has been shown that sunlight refraction in the mesosphere of Venus is able\nto provide useful constraints on mesospheric temperatures at the time of the\ntransit. The European Space Agency's Venus Express provided space-based\nobservations of Venus during the transit. Simultaneously, the Venus aureole\nphotometry was observed using ground-based facilities and solar telescopes\norbiting Earth (NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory, JAXA HINODE). As the properties\nof spatial and temporal variability of the mesosphere are still debated, the\nopportunity of observing it at all latitudes at the same time, offered by the\ntransit, is rather unique. In this first paper, we establish new methods for\nanalyzing the photometry of the so-called aureole that is produced by\nrefraction of the solar light, and we investigate the choice of physical models\nthat best reproduce the observations. We obtain an independent constraint of\n4.8 +/- 0.5 km for the aerosol scale height in the upper haze region above 80\nkm. We show that a full multiple-layer approach is required to adequately\nreproduce the aureole photometry, which appears to be sensitive to several\nsecond-order variations in the vertical refractivity.",

Generally, at small\ndistances from the Sun, in both the slow and fast solar wind, we observe the\nhigh degree of multifractality (intermittency) that decreases somewhat slowly\nwith distance and slowly with latitude. The obtained results seem to suggest\nthat generally intermittency in the solar wind has a solar origin. However, the\nfast and slow streams, shocks, and other nonlinear interactions can only be\nconsidered as the drivers of the intermittent turbulence. It seems that\nanalysis shows that turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane evolves too slowly to\nmaintain the intermittency with the distance and latitude. Moreover, we confirm\nthat the multifractality and intermittency are at a lower level than in the\necliptic, as well as the existence of symmetry with respect to the ecliptic\nplane, suggesting that there are similar turbulent properties observed in the\ntwo hemispheres.",

However, a critical challenge for the\ninitiative is the damage to the spacecraft by interstellar gas and dust during\nthe journey. In this paper, we quantify the interaction of a relativistic\nspacecraft with gas and dust in the interstellar medium. For gas bombardment,\nwe find that damage by track formation due to heavy elements is an important\neffect. We find that gas bombardment can potentially damage the surface of the\nspacecraft to a depth of $\\sim 0.1$ mm for quartz material after traversing a\ngas column of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 2\\times 10^{18}\\rm cm^{-2}$ along the path to\n$\\alpha$ Centauri, whereas the effect is much weaker for graphite material. The\neffect of dust bombardment erodes the spacecraft surface and produces numerous\ncraters due to explosive evaporation of surface atoms. For a spacecraft speed\n$v=0.2c$, we find that dust bombardment can erode a surface layer of $\\sim 0.5$\nmm thickness after the spacecraft has swept a column density of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim\n3\\times 10^{17}\\rm cm^{-2}$, assuming the standard gas-to-dust ratio of the\ninterstellar medium. Dust bombardment also damages the spacecraft surface by\nmodifying the material structure through melting. We calculate the equilibrium\nsurface temperature due to collisional heating by gas atoms as well as the\ntemperature profile as a function of depth into the spacecraft. Our\nquantitative results suggest methods for damage control, and we highlight\npossibilities for shielding strategies and protection of the spacecraft.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Open clusters have been the focus of several exoplanet surveys but only a few\nplanets have so far been discovered. The \\emph{Kepler} spacecraft revealed an\nabundance of small planets around small, cool stars, therefore, such cluster\nmembers are prime targets for exoplanet transit searches. Kepler's new mission,\nK2, is targeting several open clusters and star-forming regions around the\necliptic to search for transiting planets around their low-mass constituents.\nHere, we report the discovery of the first transiting planet in the\nintermediate-age (800 Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint\n($\\mathrm{Kp = 15.5\\,mag}$) $\\mathrm{M3.0\\pm0.5}$ dwarf from K2's Campaign 5\nwith an effective temperature of $\\mathrm{3471 \\pm 124\\,K}$, approximately\nsolar metallicity and a radius of $\\mathrm{0.402 \\pm 0.050 \\,R_\\odot}$. We\ndetected a transiting planet with a radius of $\\mathrm{3.47^{+0.78}_{-0.53} \\,\nR_\\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry,\nmedium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging and\narchival survey images to rule out any false positive detection scenarios,\nvalidate the planet, and further characterize the system. The planet's radius\nis very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have Neptune-sized transiting\nplanets. The comparatively large radius of K2-95b is consistent with the other\nrecently discovered cluster planets K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper\nScorpius), indicating systematic differences in their evolutionary states or\nformation. These discoveries from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and\nevolution in cluster environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test\ndifferences between field-star and cluster planet populations.",

In the past, EVDFs were obtained mainly\nfor antiparallel reconnection and under the influence of weak guide-fields in\nthe direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. EVDFs are, however, not\nwell known, yet, for oblique (or component-) reconnection in dependence on\nstronger guide-magnetic fields and for the exhaust (outflow) region of\nreconnection away from the diffusion region. In view of the multi-spacecraft\nMagnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), we derived the non-Maxwellian EVDFs of\ncollisionless magnetic reconnection in dependence on the guide-field strength\n$b_g$ from small ($b_g\\approx0$) to very strong ($b_g=8$) guide-fields, taking\ninto account the feedback of the self-generated turbulence. For this sake, we\ncarried out 2.5D fully-kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations using the ACRONYM\ncode. We obtained anisotropic EVDFs and electron beams propagating along the\nseparatrices as well as in the exhaust region of reconnection. The beams are\nanisotropic with a higher temperature in the direction perpendicular rather\nthan parallel to the local magnetic field. The beams propagate in the direction\nopposite to the background electrons and cause instabilities. We also obtained\nthe guide-field dependence of the relative electron-beam drift speed, threshold\nand properties of the resulting streaming instabilities including the strongly\nnon-linear saturation of the self-generated plasma turbulence. This turbulence\nand its non-linear feedback cause non-adiabatic parallel electron acceleration\nand EVDFs well beyond the limits of the quasi-linear approximation, producing\nphase space holes and an isotropizing pitch-angle scattering.",

The three program stars turned out to be one inactive Be star, one\nactive, continuously outbursting Be star, and one Be star transiting from a\nnon-outbursting into an outbursting phase, thus forming an excellent sample to\ndistill properties of Be stars in the various phases of their life-cycle.\nMethods: [abbreviated]\nResults: The short-term photometric variability of Be stars must be\ndisentangled into a stellar and a circumstellar part. The stellar part is on\nthe whole not different from what is seen in non-Be stars. However, some of the\nobserved phenomena might be to be due to resonant mode coupling, a mechanism\nnot typically considered for B-type stars. Short-term circumstellar variability\ncomes in the form of either a group of relatively well-defined, short-lived\nfrequencies during outbursts, which are called \u0160tefl frequencies, and broad\nbumps in the power spectra, indicating aperiodic variability on a time scale\nsimilar to typical low-order $g$-mode pulsation frequencies, rather than true\nperiodicity.\nConclusions: From a stellar pulsation perspective, Be stars are rapidly\nrotating SPB stars, that is they pulsate in low order $g$-modes, even if the\nrapid rotation can project the observed frequencies into the traditional\nhigh-order $p$-mode regime above about 4 c/d. However, when a circumstellar\ndisk is present, Be star power spectra are complicated by both cyclic, or\nperiodic, and aperiodic circumstellar phenomena, possibly even dominating the\npower spectrum.",

Current state-of-the-art\nmethods for centroid estimation have reached a precision of about 3e-5 pixel at\ntwo times Nyquist sampling, this was shown at the JPL by the VESTA experiment.\nA metrology system was used to calibrate intra and inter pixel quantum\nefficiency variations in order to correct pixelation errors.

The goal is to provide a proof of\nconcept for the precision requirement of the Theia spacecraft.\nThe testbed consists of two main sub-systems. The first one produces pseudo\nstars: a blackbody source is fed into a large core fiber and lights-up a\npinhole mask in the object plane, which is imaged by a mirror on the CCD. The\nsecond sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The\nfringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the\nmirror. In this paper we present the latest experiments conducted and the\nresults obtained after a series of upgrades on the testbed was completed. The\ncalibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy estimated at 4e-4\npixel. After including the pixel position information, an astrometric accuracy\nof 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more than 5 pixels.

Amongst them, we find the focus evolution, straylight\nand basic angle variations\nContrary to pre-launch expectations, the image quality is continuously\nevolving, during commissioning and the nominal mission. Payload\ndecontaminations and wavefront sensor assisted refocuses have been carried out\nto recover optimum performance. Straylight and basic angle variations several\norders of magnitude greater than foreseen were found and studied during\ncommissioning by the Gaia scientists (payload experts). Building on their\ninvestigations, an ESA-Airbus DS working group was established during the early\nnominal mission and worked on a detailed root cause analysis. In parallel, Gaia\nscientists have also continued analysing the data, most notably comparing the\nBAM signal to global astrometric solutions, with remarkable agreement.\nIn this contribution, a status review of these issues will be provided, with\nemphasis on the mitigation schemes and the lessons learned for future space\nmissions where extreme stability is a key requirement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In anticipation of improved observational data for Jupiter's gravitational\nfield from the Juno spacecraft, we predict the static tidal response for a\nvariety of Jupiter interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of\nhydrogen-helium mixtures. We calculate hydrostatic-equilibrium gravity terms\nusing the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid (CMS) method that\neliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method\ncaptures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations,\nwhich we find to be important for a rapidly-rotating planet like Jupiter. Our\npredicted static tidal Love number $k_2 = 0.5900$ is $\\sim$10\\% larger than\nprevious estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal\nharmonic coefficient $J_2$, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes\nare made to interior structure while holding $J_2$ fixed at the observed value.\nWe note that the predicted static $k_2$ might change due to Jupiter's dynamical\nresponse to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may\nbe detectable, although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for\nhighly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter's tidal response\nwill be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal\nsignals from effects of other interior dynamics in Jupiter's gravitational\nfield.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The largest geomagnetic storm so far in the solar cycle 24 was produced by a\nfast coronal mass ejection (CME) originating on 2015 March 15. It was an\ninitially west-oriented CME and expected to only cause a weak geomagnetic\ndisturbance. Why did this CME finally cause such a large geomagnetic storm? We\ntry to find some clues by investigating its propagation from the Sun to 1 AU.\nFirst, we reconstruct the CME's kinematic properties in the corona from the\nSOHO and SDO imaging data with the aid of the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS)\nmodel. It is suggested that the CME propagated to the west\n$\\sim$$33^\\circ$$\\pm$$10^\\circ$ away from the Sun-Earth line with a speed of\nabout 817 km s$^{-1}$ before leaving the field of view of the SOHO/LASCO C3\ncamera. A magnetic cloud (MC) corresponding to this CME was measured in-situ by\nthe Wind spacecraft two days later. By applying two MC reconstruction methods,\nwe infer the configuration of the MC as well as some kinematic information,\nwhich implies that the CME possibly experienced an eastward deflection on its\nway to 1 AU. However, due to the lack of observations from the STEREO\nspacecraft, the CME's kinematic evolution in interplanetary space is not clear.\nIn order to fill this gap, we utilize numerical MHD simulation, drag-based CME\npropagation model (DBM) and the model for CME deflection in interplanetary\nspace (DIPS) to recover the propagation process, especially the trajectory, of\nthe CME from $30 R_S$ to 1 AU. It is suggested that the trajectory of the CME\nwas deflected toward the Earth by about $12^\\circ$, consistent with the\nimplication from the MC reconstruction at 1 AU. This eastward deflection\nprobably contributed to the CME's unexpected geoeffectiveness by pushing the\ncenter of the initially west-oriented CME closer to the Earth.",

A\ntriangulation method based on STEREO stereoscopic observations is employed to\ndetermine the kinematics of the CME, and the outcome is compared with the\nresult derived from the type II radio burst with a solar wind electron density\nmodel. A Grad-Shafranov technique is applied to Wind in situ data to\nreconstruct the flux-rope structure and compare it with the observation of the\nsolar source region, which helps understand the geo-effectiveness associated\nwith the CME structure. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the CME undergoes an\nimpulsive acceleration, a rapid deceleration before reaching MESSENGER, and\nthen a gradual deceleration out to 1 AU, which should be noticed in CME\nkinematics models; (2) the type II radio burst was probably produced from a\nhigh-density interaction region between the CME-driven shock and a nearby\nstreamer or from the shock flank with lower heights, which implies\nuncertainties in the determination of CME kinematics using solely type II radio\nbursts; (3) the flux-rope orientation and chirality deduced from in situ\nreconstruction at Wind agree with those obtained from solar source\nobservations; (4) the prolonged southward magnetic field near the Earth is\nmainly from the axial component of the largely southward inclined flux rope,\nwhich indicates the importance of predicting both the flux-rope orientation and\nmagnetic field components in geomagnetic activity forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  During its 5 year mission, the Kepler spacecraft has uncovered a diverse\npopulation of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from\nsingle-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the\nparent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to\nsingle-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant\nover-abundance of singles. Dubbed the \"Kepler Dichotomy,\" this feature has been\ninterpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one\nwhere all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the\nconstituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing\nonly a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work,\nwe demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage,\ncan explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a\nsignificant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner\nplanets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is\nsufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets,\nenhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a\ndynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess\nsystematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems\nshould be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the\nKepler data and confirm this signal to be present.",
