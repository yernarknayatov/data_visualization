While a definitive answer on the stellar aberration issue may\nbe obtained only in numerical simulations based on the accurate astrometric\nmodel of the instrument, one could still derive realistic conclusions by\naccounting for the main expected properties of SIM. In particular, we have\nanalysied how the expected astrometric accuracy of determination of positions,\nparallaxes and proper motions will constrain the accuracy of the spaceraft\nnavigation. We estimated the astrometric errors introduced by imperfect\nmetrology (variations of the calibration term across the tile of interest),\nerrors in the baseline length estimations, and those due to orbital motion of\nthe spacecraft. We also estimate requirements on the data sampling rate\nnecessary to apply on-board in order to correct for the stellar aberration. We\nhave shown that the worst case observation scenario is realized for the motion\nof the spacecraft in the direction perpendicular to the tile. This case of\nmotion will provide the most stringent requirement on the accuracy of knowledge\nof the velocity's magnitude.

We also apply a simple\nmodel that attributes the zodiacal light as being due to three dust populations\nhaving distinct inclination distributions, namely, dust from asteroids and\nJupiter-family comets (JFCs), dust from Halley-type comets, and an isotropic\ncloud of dust from Oort Cloud comets.

When these results\nare extrapolated out to the asteroid belt, we find an upper limit on the mass\nof the light-reflecting asteroidal dust that is equivalent to a 12 km asteroid,\nand a similar extrapolation of the isotropic dust cloud out to Oort Cloud\ndistances yields a mass equivalent to a 30 km comet, although the latter mass\nis uncertain by orders of magnitude.",

After a\ndescription of these profiles, we build solar seismic models. Different models\nare considered and enable us to derive precise emitted neutrino fluxes. These\nones are validated by the seismic data and are in agreement with the recent\ndetected neutrinos, assuming 3 neutrino flavors. The seismic models are also\nused to put limits on large scale magnetic fields in the solar interior. This\nanalysis puts some upper bounds of about 3x10^7 G in the radiative zone.

While the dust concentration\ndetected between Jupiter and Saturn is mainly due to the cometary components,\nthe dust outside Saturn's orbit is dominated by grains originating from the\nEdgeworth-Kuiper Belt. In order to sustain a dust concentration that accounts\nfor the Pioneer measurements, short period external Jupiter family comets, on\norbits similar to comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann-1, have to produce $8\\times\n10^4:{\\rm g}:{\\rm s}^{-1}$ of dust grains with sizes between 0.01 and $6:{\\rm\nmm}$.

Two\ndemarcating points (a near and a far) define a domain where no difference\nbetween the discrete and the standard continuum field formalisms can be\nexperimentally detected.

Raw laser noise is several orders of magnitude above the other\nnoises and thus it is essential to bring it down to the level of other noises\nsuch as shot, acceleration, etc. Since it is impossible to maintain equal\ndistances between spacecrafts, laser noise cancellation must be achieved by\nappropriately combining the six beams with appropriate time-delays. It has been\nshown in several recent papers that such combinations are possible. In this\npaper, we present a rigorous and systematic formalism based on algebraic\ngeometrical methods involving computational commutative algebra, which\ngenerates in principle {\\it all} the data combinations cancelling the laser\nfrequency noise. The relevant data combinations form the first module of\nsyzygies, as it is called in the literature of algebraic geometry. The module\nis over a polynomial ring in three variables, the three variables corresponding\nto the three time-delays around the LISA triangle. Specifically, we list\nseveral sets of generators for the module whose linear combinations with\npolynomial coefficients generate the entire module. We find that this formalism\ncan also be extended in a straight forward way to cancel Doppler shifts due to\noptical bench motions. The two modules are infact isomorphic.\nWe use our formalism to obtain the transfer functions for the six beams and\nfor the generators. We specifically investigate monochromatic gravitational\nwave sources in the LISA band and carry out the maximisiation over linear\ncombinations of the generators of the signal-to-noise ratios with the frequency\nand source direction angles as parameters.",

Another\nfactor (relevant for comets) is outgassing. Due to impacts, tidal forces and\noutgassing, the asteroidal and cometary precession must be a generic\nphenomenon: while some rotators are in the state of visible tumbling, a much\nlarger amount of objects must be performing narrow-cone precession not so\neasily observable from the Earth. The internal dissipation in a freely\nprecessing top leads to relaxation (gradual damping of the precession) and\nsometimes to spontaneous changes in the rotation axis. Recently developed\ntheory of dissipative precession of a rigid body reveals that this is a highly\nnonlinear process: while the body is precessing at an angular rate $ \\omega$,\nthe precession-caused stresses and strains in the body contain components\noscillating at other frequencies. Dependent upon the spin state, those\nfrequencies may be higher or, most remarkably, lower than the precession rate.\nIn many states dissipation at the harmonics is comparable to or even exceeds\nthat at the principal frequency. For this and other reasons, in many spin\nstates the damping of asteroidal and cometary wobble happens faster, by several\norders, than believed previously. This makes it possible to measure the\nprecession-damping rate. The narrowing of the precession cone through the\nperiod of about a year can be registered by the currently available\nspacecraft-based observational means. However, in the near-separatrix spin\nstates a precessing rotator can considerably slow down its relaxation.",

Analysis of\nthe published (over ~75 years) small-scale gravitational measurements,\npresented in this report, unveils a large secular increase in the gravitational\nforce, that reveals itself as a formal increase in the Newton's constant G at a\nrate 'G dot per G' = (1.43 +-0.08) x 10^(-5) year^(-1). Since its\ninterpretation as a true 'G dot per G' effect is excluded by laser and radar\nranging to the Moon and the interior planets as well as by double-pulsar\nstudies, which all put tight limits on any variation in G, this large secular\neffect appears to originate in a temporal increase of gravitational masses due\nto, e.g., capture of mass from a hypothetical cold dark matter halo of the Sun.\nBy virtue of the equivalence principle, the secular mass increase leads\nnaturally to modifications of the Newtonian dynamics in the Solar System, as it\npredicts a cosmic deceleration of moving bodies dependent upon their speed. In\nparticular, it predicts for the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft an anomalous, nearly\nconstant acceleration of -(11.0 +-1.8) x 10^(-10) m/s^2, in agreement with the\npublished experimental value of -(8.7 +- 0.9) x 10^(-10) m/s^2.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A one dimensional sublimation model for cometary nuclei is used to derive\nsize limits for the nuclei of sungrazing comets, and to estimate oxygen ion\nfluxes at 1 AU from their evaporation. Given that none of the ~300 sungrazers\ndetected by the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was observed after\ndisappearing behind the sun, and that small nuclei with a radius of ~3.5m could\nbe observed, it is assumed that all SOHO sungrazers were completely destroyed.\nFor the case that sublimation alone is sufficient for destruction, the model\nyields an upper size limit as a function of nuclear density, albedo and\nperihelion distance. If the density of the nuclei is that typical of porous ice\n(600kg/m^3), the maximum size is 63m. These results confirm similar model\ncalculations by Weissman (1983). An analytical expression is derived that\napproximates the model results well. We discuss possible modifications of our\nresults by different disruption mechanisms. While disruption by thermal stress\ndoes not change the upper size limits significantly, they may be somewhat\nincreased by tidal disruption (up to 100m for a density of 600kg/m^3) dependent\non the isotropy of the sublimation process and the tensile strength of the\ncomet. Implications for the Kreutz family of sungrazers are discussed.\nOxygen ions from the sublimation of sungrazing comets form a tail. Fluxes\nfrom this tail are sufficiently high to be measured at 1 AU by particle\ndetectors on spacecraft, but the duration of a tail crossing is only about half\nan hour. Therefore the probability of a spacecraft actually encountering a tail\nof an evaporating sungrazer is only of the order of two percent per year.",

We apply a simple version of this method to\nthe line at 478 keV that is expected to arise from nucleosynthesis of 7Be in\nnearby novae. This search covers the entire southern ecliptic hemisphere during\n1995-1997, including five known individual events, and possible undiscovered\nindividual events.

We use this feature of the\ninstrument to search for a quasi-constant level of 478 keV emission from the\naccumulation of 7Be from several novae that are expected to occur in the\ndirection of the GC during that isotope's 53 d half-life. We derive upper\nlimits on the transient (single-nova) emission which improve on previous limits\nby about an order of magnitude, and limits on the steady (many-nova) emission\nwhich represent a factor 2 improvement.

The spectrum is dominated by strong\nH2 absorption (column density ~10**20 g/cm**2), which appears at a radial\nvelocity different from other interstellar absorption lines and may be\npartially circumbinary. This absorption makes study of spectral features from\nthe binary system difficult.

The O VI shows a P Cygni profile that varies\nin velocity and strength with binary phase. We compare this with similar\nchanges seen in Balmer line profiles. We extract the FUV light curve and\ncompare it with the optical light curve. There is an eclipse in both wavelength\nregions, but the FUV minimum lasts much longer, well beyond the visible light\negress.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The collinear Lagrange points of the Sun-Earth system provide an ideal\nenvironment for highly sensitive space science missions. Consequently many new\nmissions are planed by ESA and NASA that require satellites close to these\npoints. For example, the SOHO spacecraft built by ESA is already installed in\nthe first collinear Lagrange point. Neither uncontrolled spacecraft nor escape\nmotors will stay close to the Lagrange points for a long time. In case an\noperational satellite explodes, the fragmentation process will take place close\nto the Lagrange point. Apparently a number of spacecraft will accumulate close\nto the Lagrange points over the next decades. We investigate the space debris\nhazard posed by these spacecraft if they explode and fall back to an Earth\norbit. From our simulation we find that, as expected, about half of the\nfragments drift towards the Earth while the other half drifts away from it.\nAround 2% of the simulated fragments even impact the Earth within one year\nafter the explosion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The physical meaning, the properties and the consequences of a discrete\nscalar field are discussed; limits for the validity of a mathematical\ndescription of fundamental physics in terms of continuous fields are a natural\noutcome of discrete fields with discrete interactions. The discrete scalar\nfield is ultimately the gravitational field of general relativity, necessarily,\nand there is no place for any other fundamental scalar field, in this context.\nPart of the paper comprehends a more generic discussion about the nature, if\ncontinuous or discrete, of fundamental interactions. There is a critical point\ndefined by the equivalence between the two descriptions. Discrepancies between\nthem can be observed far away from this point as a continuous-interaction is\nalways stronger below it and weaker above it than a discrete one. It is\npossible that some discrete-field manifestations have already been observed in\nthe flat rotation curves of galaxies and in the apparent anomalous acceleration\nof the Pioneer spacecrafts. The existence of a critical point is equivalent to\nthe introduction of an effective-acceleration scale which may put Milgrom's\nMOND on a more solid physical basis. Contact is also made, on passing, with\ninflation in cosmological theories and with Tsallis generalized one-parameter\nstatistics which is regarded as proper for discrete-interaction systems. The\nvalidity of Botzmann statistics is then reduced to idealized asymptotic states\nwhich, rigorously, are reachable only after an infinite number of internal\ninteractions . Tsallis parameter is then a measure of how close a system is\nfrom its idealized asymptotic state.",

Infrared interferometers are a highly sensitive astronomical\ninstruments that enable us to observe terrestrial planets around nearby stars.\nIn this context the Infrared Space Interferometry Mission (IRSI)/ DARWIN is\nstudied. The current design calls for a constellation of 6 free flying\ntelescopes using 1.5m mirrors, plus one hub and one master spacecraft. As the\nbaseline trajectory an orbit about the second collinear libration point of the\nEarth-Sun system has been selected. The thermal radiation from the\ninterplanetary dust cloud that surrounds the Sun, the so-called zodiacal\ninfrared foreground, is a major concern for any high-sensitivity infrared\nmission. The most reliable information about this radiation comes from the\nmeasurements by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. There are\nvarious ways to detect faint terrestrial planets despite the bright foreground.\nWe find that, using integration times in the order of 30h, the baseline mission\nscenario is capable of detecting earth-sized exo-planets out to 14pc. We seize\nthe suggestion that increasing the heliocentric distance of the instrument\nwould make the observing conditions even better. A dust model that was fitted\nto the COBE measurements shows that an observing location of DARWIN in the\nouter solar system would potentially reduce the zodiacal foreground by a factor\nof 100, effectively increasing the number of potential target stars by almost a\nfactor of 30.",

This provides a measure of the likelihood that the\nvariability of the solar neutrino flux, as measured by the GALLEX-GNO data, has\nits origin in the equatorial section of the convection zone. We apply the\nshuffle test, randomly reassigning measurements among runs, to estimate the\nsignificance of the value of the statistic computed from the actual data. This\ntest implies that the result is significant at the 0.2% level. When, for\ncomparison, we repeat this analysis for the radiative zone, we find that the\nintegral resonance statistic is not significant.\nThese results support earlier evidence for rotational modulation of the solar\nneutrino flux.",

The most commonly used interstellar\ngrain size distribution is characterized by a a^-3.5 power law in grain radii\na, and extends to a maximum grain radius of 0.25 mu. The extension of the\ninterstellar grain size distribution to such large radii will have a major\neffect on the median grain size, and on the amount of mass needed to be tied up\nin dust for a given visual optical depth. It is therefore important to\ninvestigate whether this population of larger dust particles prevails in the\ngeneral interstellar medium, or if it is merely a local phenomenon. The\npresence of large interstellar grains can be mainly inferred from their effect\non the intensity and radial profiles of scattering halos around X-ray sources.\nIn this paper we examine the grain size distribution that gives rise to the\nX-ray halo around Nova Cygni 1992. The results of our study confirm the need to\nextend the interstellar grain size distribution in the direction of this source\nto and possibly beyond 2.0 mu. The model that gives the best fit to the halo\ndata is characterized by: (1) a grain size distribution that follows an a^-3.5\npower law up to 0.50 mu, followed by an a^-4.0 extension from 0.50 mu to 2.0\nmu; and (2) silicate and graphite (carbon) dust-to-gas mass ratios of 0.0044\nand 0.0022, respectively, consistent with solar abundances constraints.\nAdditional observations of X-ray halos probing other spatial directions are\nbadly needed to test the general validity of this result.",

The resulting beat\nfrequency is so high that its phase cannot be read to sufficient accuracy when\nreferenced to state-of-the-art space-qualified clocks. This is the problem that\nis addressed in this paper. We introduce a set of time-domain algorithms in\nwhich the effects of clock jitter are exactly canceled. The method employs the\ntwo-color laser approach that has been previously proposed, but avoids the\nsingularities that arise in the previous frequency-domain algorithms. In\naddition, several practical aspects of the laser and clock noise cancellation\nschemes are addressed.",

The particle increases have\nbeen explained variously as due to diffusion from a field line connection with\na CIR at a greater distance, perpendicular diffusion in latitude, propagation\nfrom the inner Corona or an acceleration process on a connecting field line.\nNumerical solutions to the 1-D propagation equation upstream of a CIR shock for\nreasonable diffusion mean free paths are shown here to limit the source of the\nincreases to within about 2 AU of the CIR's, asssuming the CIR's either trap or\naccelerate energetic particles and they diffuse from the nearby CIR interface.\nThe problem of allowing propagation from the CIR's is eased if the CIRs are\nlocated according to the predictions for the current sheet with a solar source\nsurface at $2.5 R_{s}$, rather than at $3.25 R_{s}$. Energetic electron\nobservations showing delays with respect to the CIR-associated ions suggest\npossibly an acceleration in the inner corona, rather than in the CIR-associated\nshock.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a statistical analysis of 132 dayside (LT 0700-1700) bow shock\ncrossings of the AMPTE/IRM spacecraft. We perform a superposed epoch analysis\nof plasma and magnetic field parameters as well as of low frequency magnetic\npower spectra some minutes upstream and downstream of the bow shock by dividing\nthe events into categories depending on the angle between bow shock normal and\ninterplanetary magnetic field and on the plasma-beta, i.e., the ratio of plasma\nto magnetic pressure.\nDownstream of the quasi-perpendicular low-beta (beta < 0.5) bow shock we find\na dominance of the left-hand polarized component at frequencies just below the\nion cyclotron frequency with amplitudes of about 3 nT. These waves are\nidentified as ion cyclotron waves which grow in a low-beta regime due to the\nproton temperature anisotropy. We find a strong correlation of this anisotropy\nwith the intensity of the left-hand polarized component. Downstream of some\nnearly perpendicular high-beta (beta > 1.0) crossings mirror waves are\nidentified. However, there are also cases where the conditions for mirror modes\nare met downstream of the nearly perpendicular shock, but no mirror waves are\nobserved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The accuracy of astrometric observations conducted via a space-borne optical\ninterferometer orbiting the Earth is expected to approach a few\nmicroarcseconds. Data processing of such extremely high-precision measurements\nrequires access to a rigorous relativistic model of light ray propagation\ndeveloped in the framework of General Relativity. The data-processing of the\nspace interferometric observations must rely upon the theory of\ngeneral-relativistic transformations between the spacecraft, geocentric, and\nsolar barycentric reference systems allowing unique and unambiguous\ninterpretation of the stellar aberration and parallax effects. On the other\nhand, the algorithm must also include physically adequate treatment of the\nrelativistic effect of light deflection caused by the spherically-symmetric\n(monopole-dependent) part of the gravitational field of the Sun and planets as\nwell as the quadrupole- and spin-dependent counterparts of it. In some\nparticular cases the gravitomagnetic field induced by the translational motion\nof the Sun and planets should be also taken into account for unambigious\nprediction of the light-ray deflection angle. In the present paper we describe\nthe corresponding software program for taking into account all classical\n(proper motion, parallax, etc.) and relativistic (aberration, deflection of\nlight) effects up to the microarcsecond threshold and demonstrate, using\nnumerical simulations, how observations of stars and/or quasars conducted on\nboard a space optical interferometer orbiting the Earth can be processed and\ndisentangled.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We observed comet 2P/Encke with the Infrared Space Observatory ISOCAM on July\n14, 1997 from a particularly favorable viewing geometry above the comet's\norbital plane and at a distance of 0.25 AU. A structured coma was observed,\nalong with a long, straight dust trail. For the first time, we are able to\nobserve the path of particles as they evolve from the nucleus to the trail. The\nparticles that produce the infrared coma are large, with a radiation to\ngravitational force ratio beta<0.001 (corresponding to >mm-sized particles).\nThe dust trail follows the orbit of the comet across our image, with a central\ncore that is 20,000 km wide, composed of particles with beta<1e-5 (size $\\sim\n5$ cm) from previous apparitions. The abundant large particles near the comet\npose a significant hazard to spacecraft. There is no evidence of a classical\ncometary dust tail due to small particles with beta>0.001, in marked contrast\nto other comets like P/Halley or C/Hale-Bopp. The structure of the coma\nrequires anisotropic emission and that the spin axis of the nucleus to be\nnearly parallel to the orbital plane, resulting in strong seasonal variations\nof the particle emission. While most of the infrared coma emission is due to\ndust produced during the 1997 apparition, the core of the dust trail requires\nemissions from previous apparitions. The total mass lost during the 1997\napparition is estimated to be\n2-6e13 g. Comparing to the gas mass loss from ultraviolet observations, the\ndust-to-gas mass ratio is 10-30, much higher than has ever been suggested from\nvisual light observations. Using the recently-measured nuclear diameter, we\nfind that Encke can only last 3000-10,000 rhoN yr (where rhoN is the nuclear\ndensity in g/cc) at its present mass loss rate.",
