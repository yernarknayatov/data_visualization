A propulsion system to transport large\npayloads with short transit times between different planetary orbits. 2. A cost\neffective lifting of large payloads into earth orbit. For the solution of the\nfirst problem a deuterium fusion bomb propulsion system is proposed where a\nthermonuclear detonation wave is ignited in a small cylindrical assembly of\ndeuterium with a gigavolt-multimegampere proton beam, drawn from the\nmagnetically insulated spacecraft acting in the ultrahigh vacuum of space as a\ngigavolt capacitor. For the solution of the second problem, the ignition is\ndone by argon ion lasers driven by high explosives, with the lasers destroyed\nin the fusion explosion and becoming part of the exhaust.",

They have shapes of giant\njellyfish, carrots or columns and last tens of milliseconds. In Earth's\natmosphere, sprites mostly emit in red and blue wavelengths from excited N2 and\nN2+ and span a vertical range between 50 and 90 km above the surface. The\nemission spectra, morphology and occurrence heights of sprites reflect the\nproperties of the planetary atmosphere they inhabit and are related to the\nintensity of the initiating parent lightning.. This paper presents results of\ntheoretical calculations of the expected occurrence heights of sprites above\nlightning discharges in the CO2 atmosphere of Venus, the N2 atmosphere of Titan\nand the H2-He atmosphere of Jupiter. The expected emission features are\npresented and the potential of detecting sprites in planetary atmospheres by\norbiting spacecraft is discussed.",

The gravito-magnetic field, which is the cause of the\nwell known Lense-Thirring precessions of elliptic orbits, is generated by the\nspin S of the central body. It deflects and displaces the trajectories\ndifferently according to the mutual orientation of S and the orbital angular\nmomentum L of the test particle. The gravito-electric force, which induces the\nEinstein precession of the perihelion of the orbit of Mercury, always deflects\nthe trajectories inward irrespective of the L-S orientation. We numerically\ncompute their effect on the range r, radial and transverse components v_r and\nv_\\tau of the velocity and speed v of the NEAR spacecraft at its closest\napproach with the Earth in January 1998 when it experienced an anomalous\nincrease of its asymptotic outgoing velocity v_\\infty o of 13.46 +/- 0.01 mm\nsec^-1; while the gravito-electric force was modeled in the software used to\nprocess the NEAR data, this was not done for the gravito-magnetic one. The\nrange-rate and the speed are affected by general relativistic\ngravito-electromagnetism at 10^-2 (gravito-electric)-10^-5 (gravito-magnetic)\nmm sec^-1 level.

In fact, the exploration of the\nX-ray sky during the 70s-90s has established X-ray astronomy as a fundamental\nfield of astrophysics. Today, the emission from astrophysical sources is by\nlarge best known at energies below 10 keV. The main reason for this situation\nis purely technical since grazing incidence reflection has so far been limited\nto the soft X-ray band. Above 10 keV all the observations have been obtained\nwith collimated detectors or coded mask instruments. To make a leap step\nforward in X-ray astronomy above 10 keV it is necessary to extend the principle\nof focusing X ray optics to higher energies, up to 80 keV and beyond. To this\nend, ASI and CNES are presently studying the implementation of a X-ray mission\ncalled Simbol-X.\nTaking advantage of emerging technology in mirror manufacturing and\nspacecraft formation flying, Simbol-X will push grazing incidence imaging up to\n80 keV and beyond, providing a strong improvement both in sensitivity and\nangular resolution compared to all instruments that have operated so far above\n10 keV. This technological breakthrough will open a new high-energy window in\nastrophysics and cosmology. Here we will address the problematic of the\ndevelopment for such a distributed and deformable instrument. We will focus on\nthe main performances of the telescope, like angular resolution, sensitivity\nand source localization. We will also describe the specificity of the\ncalibration aspects of the payload distributed over two satellites and\ntherefore in a not \"frozen\" configuration.",

Analysis of\nthese data yields information on the plasma density, density fluctuations, and\nplasma flow speeds in the corona and solar wind, and on the magnetic field in\nthe solar corona. This paper will concentrate on the information that can be\nobtained from measurements of Faraday rotation through the corona and inner\nsolar wind. The magnitude of Faraday rotation is proportional to the line of\nsight integral of the plasma density and the line-of-sight component of the\nmagnetic field. Faraday rotation provides an almost unique means of estimating\nthe magnetic field in this part of space. This technique has contributed to\nmeasurement of the large scale coronal magnetic field, the properties of\nelectromagnetic turbulence in the corona, possible detection of electrical\ncurrents in the corona, and probing of the internal structure of coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). This paper concentrates on the search for small-scale coronal\nturbulence and remote sensing of the structure of CMEs. Future investigations\nwith the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) or Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)\ncould provide unique observational input on the astrophysics of CMEs.",

Over\nthe course of the dimming event we observe the dynamic increase of non-thermal\nline broadening in the 195.12Angstrom emission line of Fe XII as the corona\nopens. As the corona begins to close, refill and brighten, we see a reduction\nof the non-thermal broadening towards the pre-eruption level. We propose that\nthe dynamic evolution of non-thermal broadening is the result of the growth of\nAlfven wave amplitudes in the magnetically open rarefied dimming region,\ncompared to the dense closed corona prior to the CME. We suggest, based on this\nproposition, that, as open magnetic regions, coronal dimmings must act just as\ncoronal holes and be sources of the fast solar wind, but only temporarily.\nFurther, we propose that such a rapid transition in the thermodynamics of the\ncorona to a solar wind state may have an impulsive effect on the CME that\ninitiates the observed dimming. This last point, if correct, poses a\nsignificant physical challenge to the sophistication of CME modeling and\ncapturing the essence of the source region thermodynamics necessary to\ncorrectly ascertain CME propagation speeds, etc.",

The X-ray observations of the\nflare taken from the RHESSI spacecraft reveal two phases of the flare\nevolution. The first phase is characterized by the altitude decrease of the\nX-ray looptop (LT) source for $\\sim$11 minutes. Such a long duration of the\ndescending LT source motion is reported for the first time. The EUV loops,\nlocated below the X-ray LT source, also undergo contraction with similar speed\n($\\sim$15 km s$^{-1}$) in this interval. During the second phase the two\ndistinct hard X-ray footpoints (FP) sources are observed which correlate well\nwith UV and H$\\alpha$ flare ribbons. The X-ray LT source now exhibits upward\nmotion. The RHESSI spectra during the first phase are soft and indicative of\nhot thermal emission from flaring loops with temperatures $T>25$ MK at the\nearly stage. On the other hand, the spectra at high energies ($\\varepsilon\n\\gtrsim$25 keV) follow hard power laws during the second phase ($\\gamma =\n2.6-2.8$). We show that the observed motion of the LT and FP sources can be\nunderstood as a consequence of three-dimensional magnetic reconnection at a\nseparator in the corona. During the first phase of the flare, the reconnection\nreleases an excess of magnetic energy related to the magnetic tensions\ngenerated before a flare by the shear flows in the photosphere. The relaxation\nof the associated magnetic shear in the corona by the reconnection process\nexplains the descending motion of the LT source. During the second phase, the\nordinary reconnection process dominates describing the energy release in terms\nof the standard model of large eruptive flares.",

In order to guarantee their scientific\nsuccess, it is necessary to evaluate if the photon counts available at these\nresolution and cadence will provide a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nWe perform a first step in this direction by analyzing and characterizing the\nspatial intermittency of Quiet Sun images thanks to a multifractal analysis.\nWe identify the parameters that specify the scale-invariance behavior. This\nidentification allows next to select a family of multifractal processes, namely\nthe Compound Poisson Cascades, that can synthesize artificial images having\nsome of the scale-invariance properties observed on the recorded images.\nThe prevalence of self-similarity in Quiet Sun coronal images makes it\nrelevant to study the ratio between the SNR present at SoHO/EIT images and in\ncoarsened images. SoHO/EIT images thus play the role of 'high resolution'\nimages, whereas the 'low-resolution' coarsened images are rebinned so as to\nsimulate a smaller angular resolution and/or a larger distance to the Sun. For\na fixed difference in angular resolution and in Spacecraft-Sun distance, we\ndetermine the proportion of pixels having a SNR preserved at high resolution\ngiven a particular increase in effective area. If scale-invariance continues to\nprevail at smaller scales, the conclusion reached with SoHO/EIT images can be\ntransposed to the situation where the resolution is increased from SoHO/EIT to\nSO/HRI resolution at perihelion.",

Global helioseismology analysis of high-degree modes is complicated\nby the fact that the individual modes cannot be isolated, which has limited so\nfar the use of high-degree data for structure inversion of the near-surface\nlayers (r > 0.97 R). In this work, we took great care to recover the actual\nmode characteristics using a physically motivated model which included a\ncomplete leakage matrix. We included in our analysis the following instrumental\ncharacteristics: the correct instantaneous image scale, the radial and\nnon-radial image distortions, the effective position angle of the solar\nrotation axis and a correction to the Carrington elements. We also present\nvariations of the mode frequencies caused by the solar activity cycle.

The frequency shift scaled\nby the relative mode inertia is a function of frequency alone and follows a\nsimple power law, where the exponent obtained for the p modes is twice the\nvalue obtained for the f modes.

In order to attain the\nrequisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed\nbelow the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration\nnoise etc. This is achieved because of the redundancy in the data, more\nspecifically, by combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams\ncontaining fractional Doppler shifts - time delay interferometry (TDI). The\norbits of the spacecraft are computed in the gravitational field of the Sun and\nEarth in the Newtonian framework, while the optical links are treated fully\ngeneral relativistically and thus, effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay,\netc. are automatically incorporated. We show that in the model of LISA that we\nconsider here, there are symmetries inherent in the physics, which may be used\neffectively to suppress the residual laser frequency noise and simplify the\nalgebraic approach to TDI.",

Four additional\nCCDs dedicated to attitude control measurements are located at the edge of the\narray. All CCDs are 4096 pixel red-enhanced e2v CCD203-82 devices with square\n12 $\\mu$m pixels, operating from 550-920nm. Combining four rows of CCDs\nprovides a total exposure time of 1500s. The VFP will be used in a closed-loop\nsystem by the spacecraft, which operates in a drift scan mode, in order to\nsynchronize the scan and readout rates. The Near Infrared (NIR) FPA consists of\na 5 x 12 mosaic of 60 Hawaii 2RG detector arrays from Teledyne, NIR bandpass\nfilters for the wavelength bands Y, J, and H, the mechanical support structure,\nand the detector readout and signal processing electronics. The FPA is operated\nat a maximum temperature of 140 K for low dark current of 0.02e$-$/s. Each\nsensor chip assembly has 2048 x 2048 square pixels of 18 $\\mu$m size (0.15\narcsec), sensitive in the 0.8 to 1.7 $\\mu$m wavelength range. As the spacecraft\nis scanning the sky, the image motion on the NIR FPA is stabilized by a\nde-scanning mirror during the integration time of 300 s per detector. The total\nintegration time of 1500 seconds is split among the three NIR wavelengths\nbands. DUNE has been proposed to ESA's Cosmic Vision program and has been\njointly selected with SPACE for an ESA Assessment Phase which has led to the\njoint Euclid mission concept.",

We obtained high-precision velocity observations over more than\nthree weeks with eleven telescopes, with almost continuous coverage for the\ncentral ten days. This represents the most extensive campaign so far organized\non any solar-type oscillator. We describe in detail the methods we used for\nprocessing and combining the data. These involved calculating weights for the\nvelocity time series from the measurement uncertainties and adjusting them in\norder to minimize the noise level of the combined data. The time series of\nvelocities for Procyon shows the clear signature of oscillations, with a\nplateau of excess power that is centred at 0.9 mHz and is broader than has been\nseen for other stars. The mean amplitude of the radial modes is 38.1 +/- 1.3\ncm/s (2.0 times solar), which is consistent with previous detections from the\nground and by the WIRE spacecraft, and also with the upper limit set by the\nMOST spacecraft. The variation of the amplitude during the observing campaign\nallows us to estimate the mode lifetime to be 1.5 d (+1.9/-0.8 d). We also find\na slow variation in the radial velocity of Procyon, with good agreement between\ndifferent telescopes. These variations are remarkably similar to those seen in\nthe Sun, and we interpret them as being due to rotational modulation from\nactive regions on the stellar surface. The variations appear to have a period\nof about 10 days, which presumably equals the stellar rotation period or,\nperhaps, half of it. The amount of power in these slow variations indicates\nthat the fractional area of Procyon covered by active regions is slightly\nhigher than for the Sun.",

These outflows occur in areas of active regions that are faint\nin coronal spectral lines formed at typical quiet Sun and active region\ntemperatures. The outflows are positively correlated with non-thermal\nvelocities in coronal plasmas. The bulk mass motions and non-thermal velocities\nare derived from spectral line centroids and line widths, mostly from a strong\nline of Fe XII at 195.12 Angstroms. The electron temperature of the outflow\nregions estimated from an Fe XIII to Fe XII line intensity ratio is about\n1.2-1.4 MK. The electron density of the outflow regions derived from a density\nsensitive intensity ratio of Fe XII lines is rather low for an active region.\nMost regions average around 7E10+8 cm(-3), but there are variations on pixel\nspatial scales of about a factor of 4. We discuss results in detail for two\nactive regions observed by EIS. Images of active regions in line intensity,\nline width, and line centroid are obtained by rastering the regions. We also\ndiscuss data from the active regions obtained from other orbiting spacecraft\nthat support the conclusions obtained from analysis of the EIS spectra. The\nlocations of the flows in the active regions with respect to the longitudinal\nphotospheric magnetic fields suggest that these regions might be tracers of\nlong loops and/or open magnetic fields that extend into the heliosphere, and\nthus the flows could possibly contribute significantly to the solar wind.",

This paper expands upon previous work modeling the phase space\ndistributions of accelerated ions associated with the shock event encountered\non day 292 of 1991 by the Ulysses mission at 4.5 AU. A kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulation is employed here to model the diffusive acceleration process. This\nexposition presents recent developments pertaining to the incorporation into\nthe simulation of the diffusive characteristics incurred by field line\nwandering (FLW), according to the work of Giacalone and Jokipii. For a pure\nfield-line wandering construct, it is determined that the upstream spatial ramp\nscales are too short to accommodate the HI-SCALE flux increases for 200 keV\nprotons, and that the distribution function for H+ somewhat underpopulates the\ncombined SWICS/HI-SCALE spectra at the shock. This contrasts our earlier\ntheory/data comparison where it was demonstrated that diffusive transport in\nhighly turbulent fields according to kinetic theory can successfully account\nfor both the proton distributions and upstream ramp scales, using a single\nturbulence parameter. The principal conclusion here is that, in a FLW scenario,\nthe transport of ions across the mean magnetic field is slightly less efficient\nthan is required to effectively trap energetic ions within a few Larmor radii\nof the shock layer and thereby precipitate efficient acceleration. This\nhighlights the contrast between ion transport in highly turbulent shock\nenvirons and remote, less-disturbed interplanetary regions.",

We show, by\ndeveloping a sensitivity analysis of the several parameters of the model, that\none may achieve a valuable insight on the possible thermal origin of the\nso-called Pioneer anomaly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The effects of the in-flight behaviour of the bolometer arrays of the\nHerschel/PACS instrument under impacts of Galactic cosmic rays are explored.\nThis instrument is part of the ESA-Herschel payload, which will be launched at\nthe end of 2008 and will operate at the Lagrangian L2 point of the Sun-Earth\nsystem. We find that the components external to the detectors (the spacecraft,\nthe cryostat, the PACS box, collectively referred to as the `shield') are the\nmajor source of secondary events affecting the detector behaviour. The impacts\ndeposit energy on the bolometer chips and influence the behaviour of nearby\npixels. 25% of hits affect the adjacent pixels. The energy deposited raises the\nbolometer temperature by a factor ranging from 1 to 6 percent of the nominal\nvalue. We discuss the effects on the observations and compare simulations with\nlaboratory tests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The vertical stratification of the magnetic field strength in sunspot\npenumbrae is investigated by means of spectropolarimetric observations at high\nspatial resolution from the Hinode spacecraft. Assuming that the magnetic field\nchanges linearly with optical depth we find that, in those regions where the\nmagnetic field is more inclined and the Evershed flow is strongest (penumbral\nintraspines), the magnetic field can either increase or decrease with depth.\nAllowing more degrees of freedom to the magnetic field stratification reveals\nthat the magnetic field initially decreases from \\log\\tau_5 = -3 until\n\\log\\tau_5 \\simeq -1.0, but increases again below that. The presence of strong\nmagnetic fields near the continuum is at odds with the existence of regions\nvoid of magnetic fields at, or right below, the \\tau_5=1 level in the penumbra.\nHowever, they are compatible with the presence of a horizontal flux-tube-like\nfield embedded in a magnetic atmosphere.",
