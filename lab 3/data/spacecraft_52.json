Estimates from\nother lines range from 7.13 to 7.24. The preferred S abundance estimate is very\nclose to recent photospheric abundance estimates and to quiet-Sun solar wind\nand meteoritic abundances. This implies no fractionation of sulphur by\nprocesses tending to enhance the coronal abundance from the photospheric that\ndepend on the first ionization potential (FIP), or that sulphur, though its FIP\nhas an intermediate value of 10.36 eV, acts like a \"high-FIP\" element.",

The\norbit of its satellite has provided valuable information about its mass density\nwhile its albedo and colors suggest it is primitive or part of the C-complex\ntaxonomic grouping. We extend the physical characterization of this object with\nnew observations of its emission at mid-Infrared (IR) wavelengths and with\nnear-IR reflection spectroscopy. We derive an area-equivalent system diameter\nof 1.90 \\pm 0.28 km (corresponding to approximate component diameters of 1.83\nkm and 0.51 km, respectively) and a geometric albedo of 0.039 \\pm 0.012.\n1996 FG3 was previously classified as a C-type asteroid, though the combined\n0.4--2.5 micron spectrum with thermal correction indicates classification as\nB-type; both are consistent with the low measured albedo. Dynamical studies\nshow that 1996 FG3 has most probably originated in the inner main asteroid\nbelt. Recent work has suggested the inner Main Belt (142) Polana family as the\npossible origin of another low-DeltaV B-type NEA, (101955) 1999 RQ36. A similar\norigin for 1996 FG3 would require delivery by the overlapping Jupiter 7:2 and\nMars 5:9 mean motion resonances rather than the nu-6 resonance, and we find\nthis to be a low probability, but possible, origin.",

The\nE-sail requires auxiliary propulsion applied to the tips of the main tethers\nfor creating the initial angular momentum and possibly for modifying the\nspinrate later during flight to counteract the orbital Coriolis effect and\npossibly for mission specific reasons. We introduce the possibility of\nimplementing the required auxiliary propulsion by small photonic blades (small\nradiation pressure solar sails). The blades would be stretched centrifugally.\nWe look into two concepts, one with and one without auxiliary tethers. The use\nof photonic blades has the benefit of providing sufficient spin modification\ncapability for any E-sail mission while keeping the technology fully\npropellantless. We conclude that the photonic blades appear to be a feasible\nand attractive solution to E-sail spinrate control.",

Comparisons with the previous study for a lunar satellite\nperturbed by Earth are presented to measure the effect of the perturbing body's\ninclination, and illustrate that the lunar obliquity with the value 6.68\\degree\nis important for the mean motion of a lunar satellite. The application to the\nMars-Sun system is shown to prove the validity of the double-averaged model.

In this\npaper we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of PDC\nwhich was implemented in Kepler SOC 8.0.

Nearly five thousand\nperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental\nfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total\ncount up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to\nhigher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging\nof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis\nwhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of\nphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new\ncandidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T_0, and orbital period, P) are\ntabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius\n(Rp/R*), reduced semi-major axis (d/R*), and impact parameter (b). The largest\nfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% for\ncandidates smaller than 2Re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2Re) and\nthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbits\nversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). The gains are larger than\nexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1--\nQuarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1 -- Quarter 6). This demonstrates the\nbenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of\nall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the\npaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The\nprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new\ncatalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone are\nforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.",

We apply our method to a minimal thermal model\nof a satellite with ten isothermal parts (nodes) and we compare the method with\ndirect numerical integration of the nonlinear equations. We briefly study the\ncomputational complexity of our method for general thermal models of orbiting\nspacecraft and conclude that it is certainly useful for reduced models and\nconceptual design but it can also be more efficient than the direct integration\nof the equations for large models. The results of the Fourier series\ncomputations for the ten-node satellite model show that the periodic solution\nat the second perturbative order is sufficiently accurate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Globally-propagating coronal bright fronts (CBFs) in the solar corona are\namong the most dramatic manifestations of solar activity, but are not well\nunderstood despite strong links with both solar flares and coronal mass\nejections. Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) observations from the STEREO and SDO\nspacecraft are used here to study their kinematics and morphology. The first\nSTEREO observations of a CBF are presented, with the pulse observed in all\navailable EUV passbands (171, 195, 284 and for the first time, 304A). The pulse\ndisplayed similar kinematics in all passbands, although the derived pulse\nvelocity and acceleration were found to be strongly influenced by the observing\ncadence, implying that previous kinematics may have been underestimated.\nDifferent techniques for identifying CBFs and deriving their true kinematics\nwere tested, with traditional techniques shown to be prone to undefined\nuser-dependent errors. This was overcome through the development of a\nstatistically rigorous, semi-automated identification algorithm, which was then\nused to determine the kinematics of four CBF events observed by STEREO. All of\nthe events studied exhibited clear deceleration as well as increases in both\nspatial and temporal pulse width, indicating that the CBFs are dispersive. A\nCBF pulse observed by both STEREO and SDO was also studied using the algorithm,\nwith lower initial velocity and weaker deceleration noted in STEREO\nobservations compared to SDO, reaffirming the effects of image cadence on the\nderived kinematics. The kinematics obtained using SDO were highly passband\ndependent, suggesting a compressive nature. Significant pulse broadening was\nalso noted in observations from both spacecraft, allowing the dispersion rate\nof the pulse to be determined. These results indicate that coronal bright\nfronts are best interpreted as fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves propagating in\nan inhomogeneous medium.",

Both\nstars are extremely low mass (ELM, < 0.2 Msun) WDs in short-period, detached\nbinary systems. High-speed photometric observations obtained at the McDonald\nObservatory reveal ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming in both systems;\nJ1741, with a minimum companion mass of 1.1 Msun, has one of the strongest\nDoppler beaming signals ever observed in a binary system (0.59 \\pm 0.06%\namplitude). We use the observed ellipsoidal variations to constrain the radius\nof each WD. For J1741, the star's radius must exceed 0.074 Rsun. For J2119, the\nradius exceeds 0.10 Rsun. These indirect radius measurements are comparable to\nthe radius measurements for the bloated WD companions to A-stars found by the\nKepler spacecraft, and they constitute some of the largest radii inferred for\nany WD. Surprisingly, J1741 also appears to show a 0.23 \\pm 0.06% reflection\neffect, and we discuss possible sources for this excess heating. Both J1741 and\nJ2119 are strong gravitational wave sources, and the time-of-minimum of the\nellipsoidal variations can be used to detect the orbital period decay.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of plasma and\nmagnetic field from the Sun into the corona and interplanetary space. They are\nthe most significant drivers of adverse space weather at Earth and other\nlocations in the heliosphere, so it is important to understand the physics\ngoverning their eruption and propagation. However the diffuse morphology and\ntransient nature of CMEs makes them difficult to identify and track using\ntraditional image processing techniques. In this thesis the implementation of\nmultiscale image processing techniques to identify and track the CME front\nthrough coronagraph images is detailed. An ellipse characterisation of the CME\nfront is used to determine the CME kinematics and morphology with increased\nprecision as compared to techniques used in current CME catalogues, and efforts\nare underway to automate this procedure for applying to a large number of CME\nobservations for future analysis. It was found that CMEs do not simply undergo\nconstant acceleration, but rather tend to show a higher acceleration early in\ntheir propagation. The angular width of CMEs was also found to change as they\npropagate, normally increasing with height from the Sun. However these results\nwere derived from plane-of-sky measurements with no correction for how the true\nCME geometry and direction affect the kinematics and morphology observed. With\nthe advent of the unique dual perspectives of the STEREO spacecraft, the\nmultiscale methods were extended to an elliptical tie-pointing technique in\norder reconstruct the front of a CME in three-dimensions. Applying this\ntechnique to the Earth-directed CME of 12 December 2008 allowed an accurate\ndetermination of its true kinematics and morphology, and the CME was found to\nundergo early acceleration, non-radial motion, angular width expansion, and\naerodynamic drag in the solar wind as it propagated towards Earth.",

We\ntreat the debiased population of the known transneptunian objects (TNOs) as\nparent bodies and generate the dust with our collisional code. The resulting\ndust distributions are modified to take into account the influence of\ngravitational scattering and resonance trapping by planets on migrating dust\ngrains as well as the effect of sublimation. A difficulty is that the amount\nand distribution of dust are largely determined by sub-kilometer-sized bodies.\nThese are directly unobservable, and their properties cannot be accessed by\ncollisional modeling, because objects larger than 10...60m in the present-day\nEKB are not in a collisional equilibrium. To place additional constraints, we\nuse in-situ measurements of the New Horizons spacecraft within 20AU. We show\nthat the TNO population has to have a break in the size distribution at s<70km.\nHowever, even this still leaves us with several models that all correctly\nreproduce a nearly constant dust impact rates in the region of giant planet\norbits and do not violate the constraints from the non-detection of the EKB\ndust thermal emission by the COBE spacecraft. The modeled EKB dust disks, which\nconform to the observational constraints, can either be transport-dominated or\nintermediate between the transport-dominated and collision-dominated regime.\nThe in-plane optical depth of such disks is tau(r>10AU)~10^-6 and their\nfractional luminosity is f_d~10^-7.

In particular, we are interested in predicting potentially geo-effective\nInterplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) from observations of density\nstructures at large observation angles from the Sun (with the STEREO\nHeliospheric Imager instrument). We contribute to this endeavor by deriving\nanalytical formulas concerning a geometric correction for the ICME speed and\narrival time for the technique introduced by Davies et al. (2012, ApJ, in\npress) called Self-Similar Expansion Fitting (SSEF). This model assumes that a\ncircle propagates outward, along a plane specified by a position angle (e.g.\nthe ecliptic), with constant angular half width (lambda). This is an extension\nto earlier, more simple models: Fixed-Phi-Fitting (lambda = 0 degree) and\nHarmonic Mean Fitting (lambda = 90 degree). This approach has the advantage\nthat it is possible to assess clearly, in contrast to previous models, if a\nparticular location in the heliosphere, such as a planet or spacecraft, might\nbe expected to be hit by the ICME front. Our correction formulas are especially\nsignificant for glancing hits, where small differences in the direction greatly\ninfluence the expected speeds (up to 100-200 km/s) and arrival times (up to two\ndays later than the apex). For very wide ICMEs (2 lambda > 120 degree), the\ngeometric correction becomes very similar to the one derived by M\u00f6stl et al.\n(2011, ApJ, 741, id. 34) for the Harmonic Mean model. These analytic\nexpressions can also be used for empirical or analytical models to predict the\n1 AU arrival time of an ICME by correcting for effects of hits by the flank\nrather than the apex, if the width and direction of the ICME in a plane are\nknown and a circular geometry of the ICME front is assumed.",

Experimental tests of quantum phenomena involving\nmassive macroscopic objects would provide novel insights into these fundamental\nquestions. Making use of the unique environment provided by space, MAQRO aims\nat investigating this largely unexplored realm of macroscopic quantum physics.\nMAQRO has originally been proposed as a medium-sized fundamental-science space\nmission for the 2010 call of Cosmic Vision. MAQRO unites two experiments:\nDECIDE (DECoherence In Double-Slit Experiments) and CASE (Comparative\nAcceleration Sensing Experiment). The main scientific objective of MAQRO, which\nis addressed by the experiment DECIDE, is to test the predictions of quantum\ntheory for quantum superpositions of macroscopic objects containing more than\n10e8 atoms. Under these conditions, deviations due to various suggested\nalternative models to quantum theory would become visible. These models have\nbeen suggested to harmonize the paradoxical quantum phenomena both with the\nclassical macroscopic world and with our notion of Minkowski space-time. The\nsecond scientific objective of MAQRO, which is addressed by the experiment\nCASE, is to demonstrate the performance of a novel type of inertial sensor\nbased on optically trapped microspheres. CASE is a technology demonstrator that\nshows how the modular design of DECIDE allows to easily incorporate it with\nother missions that have compatible requirements in terms of spacecraft and\norbit. CASE can, at the same time, serve as a test bench for the weak\nequivalence principle, i.e., the universality of free fall with test-masses\ndiffering in their mass by 7 orders of magnitude.",

The thermo-mechanical stability of the\nspacecraft, combined with the selection of the L2 Lissajous point of the\nSun-Earth/Moon system for operations, allows stellar parallaxes to be measured\nwith standard errors less than 10 micro-arcsecond (muas) for stars brighter\nthan 12th magnitude, 25 muas for stars at 15th magnitude, and 300 muas at\nmagnitude 20. Photometric standard errors are in the milli-magnitude regime.\nThe spectroscopic data allows the measurement of radial velocities with errors\nof 15 km/s at magnitude 17. Gaia's primary science goal is to unravel the\nkinematical, dynamical, and chemical structure and evolution of the Milky Way.\nIn addition, Gaia's data will touch many other areas of science, e.g., stellar\nphysics, solar-system bodies, fundamental physics, and exo-planets. The Gaia\nspacecraft is currently in the qualification and production phase. With a\nlaunch in 2013, the final catalogue is expected in 2021.

Although analysis of images taken by the Hubble Space\nTelescope and Rosetta spacecraft suggested that the dust tail resulted from a\nrecent head-on collision between asteroids (Jewitt et al. 2010; Snodgrass et\nal. 2010), an alternative idea of ice sublimation was suggested based on the\nmorphological fitting of ground-based images (Moreno et al. 2010). Here, we\nreport a multiband observation of P/2010 A2 made on January 2010 with a 105 cm\ntelescope at the Ishigakijima Astronomical Observatory. Three broadband\nfilters, $g'$, $R_c$, and $I_c$, were employed for the observation. The unique\nmultiband data reveals that the reflectance spectrum of the P/2010 A2 dust tail\nresembles that of an Sq-type asteroid or that of ordinary chondrites rather\nthan that of an S-type asteroid. Due to the large error of the measurement, the\nreflectance spectrum also resembles the spectra of C-type asteroids, even\nthough C-type asteroids are uncommon in the Flora family. The reflectances\nrelative to the $g'$-band (470 nm) are 1.096$\\pm$0.046 at the $R_c$-band (650\nnm) and 1.131$\\pm$0.061 at the $I_c$-band (800 nm). We hypothesize that the\nparent body of P/2010 A2 was originally S-type but was then shattered upon\ncollision into scaterring fresh chondritic particles from the interior, thus\nforming the dust tail.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The aim of Dawn mission is the acquisition of data from orbits around two\nbodies, (4)Vesta and (1)Ceres, the two most massive asteroids. Due to the low\nthrust propulsion, Dawn will slowly cross and transit through ground-track\nresonances, where the perturbations on Dawn orbit may be significant. In this\ncontext, to safety go the Dawn mission from the approach orbit to the lowest\nscience orbit, it is essential to know the properties of the crossed\nresonances. This paper analytically investigates the properties of the major\nground-track resonances (1:1, 1:2, 2:3 and 3:2) appearing for Vesta orbiters:\nlocation of the equilibria, aperture of the resonances and period at the stable\nequilibria. We develop a general method using an averaged Hamiltonian\nformulation with a spherical harmonic approximation of the gravity field. If\nthe values of the gravity field coefficient change, our method stays correct\nand applicable. We also discuss the effect of one uncertainty on the C20 and\nC22 coefficients on the properties of the 1:1 resonance. These results are\nchecked by numerical tests. We determine that the increase of the eccentricity\nappearing in the 2:3 resonance is due to the C22 and S22 coefficients.\nOur method can be easily adapted to missions similar to Dawn because,\ncontrarily to the numerical results, the analytical formalism stays the same\nand is valid for a wide range of physical parameters of the asteroid (namely\nthe shape and the mass) as well as for different spacecraft orbits.\nFinally we numerically study the probability of the capture in resonance 1:1.\nOur paper reproduces, explains and supplements the results of Tricarico and\nSykes (2010).",

We\ncompare the results we obtained with KOALA, prior to the flyby, on asteroid\n(21) Lutetia with the high-spatial resolution images of the asteroid taken with\nthe OSIRIS camera on-board the ESA Rosetta spacecraft, during its encounter\nwith Lutetia. The spin axis determined with KOALA was found to be accurate to\nwithin two degrees, while the KOALA diameter determinations were within 2% of\nthe Rosetta-derived values. The 3-D shape of the KOALA model is also confirmed\nby the spectacular visual agreement between both 3-D shape models (KOALA pre-\nand OSIRIS post-flyby). We found a typical deviation of only 2 km at local\nscales between the profiles from KOALA predictions and OSIRIS images, resulting\nin a volume uncertainty provided by KOALA better than 10%. Radiometric\ntechniques for the interpretation of thermal infrared data also benefit greatly\nfrom the KOALA shape model: the absolute size and geometric albedo can be\nderived with high accuracy, and thermal properties, for example the thermal\ninertia, can be determined unambiguously. We consider this to be a validation\nof the KOALA method. Because space exploration will remain limited to only a\nfew objects, KOALA stands as a powerful technique to study a much larger set of\nsmall bodies using Earth-based observations.",

With 11 data points and 8\nparameters in the model, a statistically meaningful fit is obtained with a\nchi-squared of 2.7. We give plots of the anomalous acceleration along the\nspacecraft trajectory, and the cumulative velocity change, for the five flybys\nwhich exhibit a significant nonzero anomaly. We also discuss implications of\nthe fit for dark matter-nucleon cross sections, give the prediction of our fit\nfor the anomaly to be expected from the future Juno flyby, and give predictions\nof our fit for flyby orbit orientation changes. In addition we give formulas\nfor estimating the flyby temperature increase caused by dark matter inelastic\nscattering, and for the fraction of flyby nucleons undergoing such scatters.\nFinally, for circular satellite orbits, we give a table of predicted secular\nchanges in orbit radius. These are much too large to be reasonable -- comparing\nwith data for COBE and GP-B supplied to us by Edward Wright (after the first\nversion of this paper was posted), we find that our model predicts changes in\norbit radius that are too large by many orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Asteroseismology of DAV stars (ZZ Ceti variables) can provide valuable clues\nabout the origin, structure and evolution of DA (atmospheres rich in H) white\ndwarfs. Recently, a new DAV star, WD J191643.83+393849.7, has been discovered\nin the field of the Kepler spacecraft. It is expected that further monitoring\nof this star in the next years will enable astronomers to obtain the best\nlightcurve of a pulsating DA white dwarf ever recorded, and thus to know with\nunprecedented precision the hidden details of the internal structure of this\nstar. In this paper, we perform a first asteroseismological analysis of WD\nJ191643.83+393849.7 on the basis of fully evolutionary DA white-dwarf models.\nSpecifically, we employ a complete set of evolutionary DA white-dwarf\nstructures covering a wide range of effective temperatures, stellar masses, and\nH envelope thicknesses. These models have been obtained on the basis of a\ncomplete treatment of the evolutionary history of progenitors stars. We compute\ng-mode adiabatic pulsation periods for this set of models and compare them with\nthe pulsation periods exhibited by WD J191643.83+393849.7. Based on a tentative\nestimation of the mean period spacing of the star, we find that the stellar\nmass should be substantially large ($\\gtrsim 0.80 M_{\\odot}$), in agreement\nwith the spectroscopically derived stellar mass. Also, from period-to-period\nfits we find an asteroseismological model characterised by a low effective\ntemperature, rather high stellar mass and a thin H envelope. The possibility\nthat this rather massive pulsating white dwarf can be further monitored with\nKepler with a high degree of detail turns the star WD J191643.83+393849.7 into\na promising and unique object to study the physics of crystallization and\ncarbon/oxygen phase diagrams at high densities.

Although there are significant\ndifferences between rings and other disks, chiefly the large planet/ring mass\nratio that greatly enhances the flatness of rings (aspect ratios as small as\n1e-7), understanding of disks in general can be enhanced by understanding the\ndynamical processes observed at close-range and in real-time in planetary\nrings. We review the known ring systems of the four giant planets, as well as\nthe prospects for ring systems yet to be discovered. We then review planetary\nrings by type. The main rings of Saturn comprise our system's only dense broad\ndisk and host many phenomena of general application to disks including spiral\nwaves, gap formation, self-gravity wakes, viscous overstability and normal\nmodes, impact clouds, and orbital evolution of embedded moons. Dense narrow\nrings are the primary natural laboratory for understanding shepherding and\nself-stability. Narrow dusty rings, likely generated by embedded source bodies,\nare surprisingly found to sport azimuthally-confined arcs. Finally, every known\nring system includes a substantial component of diffuse dusty rings. Planetary\nrings have shown themselves to be useful as detectors of planetary processes\naround them, including the planetary magnetic field and interplanetary\nimpactors as well as the gravity of nearby perturbing moons. Experimental rings\nscience has made great progress in recent decades, especially numerical\nsimulations of self-gravity wakes and other processes but also laboratory\ninvestigations of coefficient of restitution and spectroscopic ground truth.\nThe age of self-sustained ring systems is a matter of debate; formation\nscenarios are most plausible in the context of the early solar system, while\nsigns of youthfulness indicate at least that rings have never been static\nphenomena.",

Laboratory demonstrations of basic features of beam-driven propulsion,\nflight, stability ('beam-riding'), and induced spin, have been completed in the\nlast decade, primarily in the microwave.

There are many candidate sail\nmaterials: carbon nanotubes and microtrusses, graphene, beryllium, etc. For\nacceleration of a sail, what is the cost-optimum high power system? Here the\ncost is used to constrain design parameters to estimate system power, aperture\nand elements of capital and operating cost. From general relations for\ncost-optimal transmitter aperture and power, system cost scales with kinetic\nenergy and inversely with sail diameter and frequency. So optimal sails will be\nlarger, lower in mass and driven by higher frequency beams. Estimated costs\ninclude economies of scale. We present several starship point concepts. Systems\nbased on microwave, millimeter wave and laser technologies are of equal cost at\ntoday's costs.

A\nfull BLENDER analysis provides further validation of the planet interpretation\nby showing that contamination of the target by an eclipsing system would rarely\nmimic the observed shape of the transits. The final validation of the planet is\nprovided by 16 radial velocities obtained with HIRES on Keck 1 over a one year\nspan. Although the velocities do not lead to a reliable orbit and mass\ndetermination, they are able to constrain the mass to a 3{\\sigma} upper limit\nof 124 MEarth, safely in the regime of planetary masses, thus earning the\ndesignation Kepler-22b.

In the Solar System, these are the saddle points\nof the gravitational potential near the planets. Typically, such points are\nembedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la\nMOND predict significant deviations from Newton's laws. As has been pointed out\nrecently, the Earth-Sun bubble may be visited by the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft\nin the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to a\ndirect test. In this work, we present a high-precision model of the Solar\nSystem's gravitational potential to determine accurate positions and motions of\nthese saddle points and study the predicted dynamical anomalies within the\nframework of quasi-linear MOND. Considering the expected sensitivity of the\nLISA Pathfinder probe, we argue that interpolation functions which exhibit a\n\"faster\" transition between the two dynamical regimes have a good chance of\nsurviving a null result. An example of such a function is the QMOND analog of\nthe so-called simple interpolating function which agrees well with much of the\nextragalactic phenomenology. We have also discovered that several of Saturn's\noutermost satellites periodically intersect the Saturn-Sun bubble, providing\nthe first example of Solar System objects that regularly undergo the MOND\nregime.",

The model is based on the assumption that that\ngreat part of the solar irradiance variability is due to the evolution of the\nstructure of the solar magnetic field. We employ a Layer-Recurrent Network\n(LRN) to model the complex relationships between the evolution of the bipolar\nmagnetic structures (input) and the solar irradiance (output). The evolution of\nthe bipolar magnetic structures is obtained from near-real time solar disk\nmagnetograms and intensity images. The magnetic structures are identify and\nclassified according to the area of the solar disk covered. We constrained the\nmodel by comparing the output of the model and observations of the solar\nirradiance made by instruments onboard of SORCE spacecraft. Here we focus on\ntwo regions of the spectra that are covered by SORCE instruments. The\ngeneralization of the network is tested by dividing the data sets on two\ngroups: the training set; and, the validation set. We have found that the model\nerror is wavelength dependent. While the model error for 24-hour forecast in\nthe band from 115 to 180 nm is lower than 5%, the model error can reach 20% in\nthe band from 180 to 310 nm. The performance of the network reduces\nprogressively with the increase of the forecast period, which limits\nsignificantly the maximum forecast period that we can achieve with the\ndiscussed architecture. The model proposed allows us to predict the total and\nspectral solar irradiance up to three days in advance.",
