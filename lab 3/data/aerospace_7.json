    "abstract": "Abstract:  Pyramidal lattice sandwich structure (PLSS) exhibits high stiffness and\nstrength-to-weight ratio which can be effectively utilized for designing\nlight-weight load bearing structures for ranging from ground to aerospace\nvehicles. While these structures provide superior strength to weigh ratio,\ntheir sound insulation capacity has not been well understood. The aim of this\nstudy is to develop numerical and experimental methods to fundamentally\ninvestigate the sound insulation property of the pyramidal lattice sandwich\nstructure with solid trusses (PLSSST). A finite element model has been\ndeveloped to predict the sound transmission loss (STL) of PLSSST and simulation\nresults have been compared with those obtained experimentally. Parametric\nstudies is then performed using the validated finite element model to\ninvestigate the effect of different parameters in pyramidal lattice sandwich\nstructure with hollow trusses (PLSSHT), revealing that the pitching angle, the\nuniform thickness and the length of the hollow truss and the lattice constant\nhave considerable effects on the sound transmission loss. Finally a design\noptimization strategy has been formulated to optimize PLSSHT in order to\nmaximize STL while meeting mechanical property requirements. It has been shown\nthat STL of the optimal PLSSHT can be increased by almost 10% at the\nlow-frequency band. The work reported here provides useful information for the\nnoise reduction design of periodic lattice structures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) method will still play a vital role in\nthe following several decade in aerospace engineering. Although RANS models are\nwidely used, empiricism and large discrepancies between models reduce the\nreliability of simulating complex flows. Therefore, in recent years,\ndata-driven turbulence model has aroused widespread concern in fluid mechanics.\nBased on the experimental/numerical simulation results, this approach aims to\nmodify or construct the turbulence model for specific purposes by machine\nlearning technologies. In this paper, we take the results calculated by SA\nmodel as training data. Different from low Reynolds number turbulent flows, the\ndata from high Reynolds number flows shows an apparent scaling effect, thus\nleading to difficulties in the data-driven modeling. In order to improve the\nfitting accuracy, we divided the flow field into near-wall region, wake region,\nand far-field region, and built individual model for every region. In this\npaper, we adopted the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and some\nauxiliary optimization algorithms to reconstruct a mapping function between\nmean variables and the eddy viscosity. Since this model reflects the\nrelationship between local flow characteristics and turbulent eddy viscosity,\nit is independent on the airfoil shape and flow condition. The training data in\nthis paper is generated from only three subsonic flow calculations of NACA0012\nairfoil. By coupling the proposed approach with N-S equations, we calculated\nvarious flow cases as well as two different airfoils and showed the eddy\nviscosity contours, velocity profiles along the normal direction of wall and\nskin friction coefficient distributions, etc. Compared with the SA model, the\nresults show a reasonable accuracy and better efficiency, which indicates the\npositive prospect of data-driven methods in turbulence modeling.",

In this paper, several variants of the Efficient Global\nOptimization algorithm for costly constrained problems depending simultaneously\non continuous decision variables as well as on quantitative and/or qualitative\ndiscrete design parameters are proposed. The adaptation that is considered is\nbased on a redefinition of the Gaussian Process kernel as a product between the\nstandard continuous kernel and a second kernel representing the covariance\nbetween the discrete variable values. Several parameterizations of this\ndiscrete kernel, with their respective strengths and weaknesses, are discussed\nin this paper. The novel algorithms are tested on a number of analytical\ntest-cases and an aerospace related design problem, and it is shown that they\nrequire fewer function evaluations in order to converge towards the\nneighborhoods of the problem optima when compared to more commonly used\noptimization algorithms.",

The camera was tested in a variety of\nenvironments, and the test results show that the system can run at a maximum\nrate of 5M pixels/s and readout noise is as low as 9.29e^- when the CCD readout\nspeed is 500K pixels/s.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Graph-based design languages in UML (Unified Modeling Language) are presented\nas a method to encode and automate the complete design process and the final\noptimization of the product or complex system. A design language consists of a\nvocabulary (digital building blocks) and a set of rules (digital composition\nknowledge) along with an executable sequence of the rules (digital encoding of\nthe design process). The rule-based mechanism instantiates a central and\nconsistent global product data structure (the so-called design graph). Upon the\ngeneration of the abstract central model, the domain-specific engineering\nmodels are automatically generated, remotely executed and their results are\nfed-back into the central design model for subsequent design decisions or\noptimizations. The design languages are manually modeled and automatically\nexecuted in a so-called design compiler. Up to now, a variety of product\ndesigns in the areas of aerospace, automotive, machinery and consumer products\nhave been successfully accelerated and automated using graph-based design\nlanguages. Different design strategies and mechanisms have been identified and\napplied in the automation of the design processes. Approaches ranging from the\nautomated and declarative processing of constraints, through fractal nested\ndesign patterns, to mathematical dimension-based derivation of the sequence of\ndesign actions are used. The existing knowledge for a design determines the\nglobal design strategy (top-down vs. bottom-up). Similarity-mechanics in the\nform of dimensionless invariants are used for evaluation to downsize the\nsolution for an overall complexity reduction. Design patterns, design paradigms\n(form follows function) and design strategies (divide and conquer) from\ninformation science are heavily used to structure, manage and handle\ncomplexity.",

Such flows are important across a\nrange of applications, including jet pumps, combustion chambers and aerospace\nengineering. Previous studies show that swirl can increase shear layer growth\nrates and, in the case of confining walls, reduce flow separation. However, the\neffect of swirl on pressure loss in a confined flow is uncertain. To address\nthis, we develop a simplified model that approximates the axial flow profile as\na linear shear layer separating uniform-velocity core and annular streams. The\nazimuthal flow profile is approximated as a solid body rotation within the core\nregion, and a parabolic mixing profile within the shear layer. This model shows\ngood agreement with computational turbulence modelling, whilst its simplicity\nand low computational cost make it ideal for benchmark predictions and design\npurposes. Using this model, we confirm that a swirling core is useful for\nincreasing shear layer growth rates, but find that it is detrimental to\npressure recovery. This has important implications for the design of diffusers\nthat incorporate swirling flows. We use the model to describe the slow\nrecirculation region that can form along the pipe axis for sufficiently large\nswirl, by approximating it as a stagnant zone with zero velocity. The criteria\nfor the development of such a region are established in terms of the pipe\nexpansion angle and inflow velocity profile.",

The benefits using CFRP\ncomposites are due to their lightweight, high stiffness, as well as corrosion\nresistance. For this reason, there is a fast growing trend in using CFRP\ncomposites for aircraft and wind turbine structural applications. The\nreplacement of the conventional aerospace-grade metal alloys (aluminum,\ntitanium, magnesium, etc.) with CFRP composites results in new challenges. For\nexample, an aircraft during flight is prone to be struck by lightning. To\nwithstand the injection of such massive amount of energy, adequate electrical\nproperties, mainly electrical conductivity, is required. In fact, electrical\nconductance (or its reciprocal, resistance) is a critical parameter\nrepresenting any material change and it can be considered an index for health\nmonitoring. In this paper, AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminated composites were\ninjected with two types of electrical currents, impulse current and direct\ncurrent. The change in measured electrical resistance was recorded. A\nsignificant resistance drop occurred after electrical current injections.\nFurthermore, four-point flexural tests were performed on these composites to\ncorrelate an electrical resistance change with a potential flexural property\nchange. There was no clear trend between a resistance change and flexural\nstrength/modulus change of the test coupons, regardless of current injection.\nHowever, it was observed that the injection of the current affects the contact\nresistance such that its resistance decreases.",

This effort generated NASA's first\ngrand challenge, the Asteroid Grand Challenge, a large scale effort using\nmultidisciplinary collaborations and innovative engagement mechanisms focused\non finding and addressing asteroid threats to human populations. In April 2010,\nPresident Barack Obama announced a mission to send humans to an asteroid by\n2025. This resulted in the agency's Asteroid Redirect Mission to leverage and\nmaximize existing robotic and human efforts to capture and reroute an asteroid,\nwith the goal of eventual human exploration. The AGC, initiated in 2013,\ncomplemented ARM by expanding public participation, partnerships, and other\napproaches to find, understand, and overcome these potentially harmful\nasteroids. This paper describes a selection of AGC activities implemented from\n2013 to 2017 and their results, excluding those conducted by NASA's Near Earth\nObject Observations Program and other organizations. The strategic development\nof the initiative is outlined as well as initial successes, strengths, and\nweaknesses resulting from the first four years of AGC activities and\napproaches. Finally, we describe lesson learned and areas for continued work\nand study. The AGC lessons learned and strategies could inform the work of\nother agencies and organizations seeking to conduct a global scientific\ninvestigation with matrixed organizational support, multiple strategic\npartners, and numerous internal and external open innovation approaches and\naudiences.",

Such information is crucial for understanding the formation of\nsurface features and can tremendously improve our understanding of the icy\ntectonics.

Furthermore,\nit also improves the accuracy of gravity field measurements reflecting the\ninterior structure, collaborating with the radio science experiment. In\naddition to range measurements, the signal strength and the waveform of the\nlaser pulses reflected from the moon's surface contain information about\nsurface reflectance at the laser wavelength and small scale roughness.\nTherefore we can infer the degrees of chemical and physical alterations, e.g.,\nerosion, space weathering, compaction and deposition of exogenous materials,\nthrough GALA measurements without being affected by illumination conditions.\nJUICE spacecraft carries ten science payloads including GALA.

Since agents know\nthe event-triggering condition for measurements to be sent, the lack of a\nmeasurement is thus also informative and fused into state estimates. The robots\nuse a Covariance Intersection (CI) mechanism to occasionally synchronize their\nlocal estimates of the full network state. In addition, heuristic balancing\ndynamics on the robots' CI-triggering thresholds ensure that, in large diameter\nnetworks, the local error covariances remains below desired bounds across the\nnetwork. Simulations on both linear and nonlinear dynamics/measurement models\nshow that the event-triggering approach achieves nearly optimal state\nestimation performance in a wide range of operating conditions, even when using\nonly a fraction of the communication cost required by conventional full data\nsharing.

In general, foams are very effective as energy\ndissipative materials and have been widely used in many areas such as\nautomotive, aerospace and biomedical industries. In the case of graphene-based\nfoams, the good mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the intrinsic\ngraphene and/or GO electronic and mechanical properties. Despite the attractive\nphysical properties of graphene/GO based-foams, their structural and thermal\nstabilities are still a problem for some applications. For instance, they are\neasily degraded when placed in flowing solutions, either by the collapsing of\ntheir layers or just by structural disintegration into small pieces. Recently,\na new and scalable synthetic approach to produce low-density 3D macroscopic GO\nstructure interconnected with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymeric chains\n(pGO) was proposed. A controlled amount of PDMS is infused into the\nfreeze-dried foam resulting into a very rigid structure with improved\nmechanical properties, such as tensile plasticity and toughness. The PDMS wets\nthe graphene oxide sheets and acts like a glue bonding PDMS and GO sheets. In\norder to obtain further insights on mechanisms behind the enhanced mechanical\npGO response we carried out fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations.

Student's-T processes maintain the primary advantages of\nGaussian processes (kernel function, analytic update rule) with additional\nbenefits beyond Gaussian processes.

For the non- reacting cases, good agreement with\nthe experimental data is achieved by solvers at high numerical resolution. The\nreacting cases are more challenging due to the small length scale of the flame\nand the suppression of sinuous mode of absolute instability by the density\nratio. The analysis of the turbulent simulation data using the concept of the\nLyapunov exponent and the Wasserstein metric provides a more quantitative\napproach to assess the mesh dependency of the simulation results. The\nconvergence of the Lyapunov exponent is shown to be a more sensitive and\nstronger indication of mesh-independence.

With increasing demands in long working distance, low\nenergy consumption, and weak signal sensing systems, the poor responsivity of\nconventional Silicon-based PSDs has become a bottleneck limiting their\napplications. Herein, we propose a high-performance passive PSD based on\ngraphene-Si heterostructure. The graphene is adapted as a photon absorbing and\ncharge separation layer working together with Si as a junction, while the high\nmobility provides promising ultra-long carrier diffusion length and facilitates\nlarge active area of the device. A PSD with working area of 8 mm x 8 mm is\ndemonstrated to present excellent position sensitivity to weak light at nWs\nlevel (much better than the limit of ~{\\mu}Ws of Si p-i-n PSDs). More\nimportantly, it shows very fast response and low degree of non-linearity of\n~3%, and extends the operating wavelength to the near infrared (IR) region\n(1319 and 1550 nm). This work therefore provides a new strategy for high\nperformance and broadband PSDs.",

NASA plans to use the Orion crew\nvehicle to transport humans between Earth and cislunar space where there will\nbe a stationed habitat known as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG). The proximity to\nthe lunar surface allows for direct communication between the DSG and surface\nassets, which enables low-latency telerobotic exploration. The operational\nconstraints for telerobotics must be fully explored on Earth before being\nutilized on space exploration missions. We identified two constraints on space\nexploration using low-latency surface telerobotics and attempts to quantify\nthese constraints. A constraint associated with low-latency surface\ntelerobotics is the bandwidth available between the orbiting command station\nand the ground assets. The bandwidth available will vary during operation. As a\nresult, it is critical to quantify the operational video conditions required\nfor effective exploration. We designed an experiment to quantify the threshold\nframe rate required for effective exploration. The experiment simulated\ngeological exploration via low-latency surface telerobotics using a COTS rover\nin a lunar analog environment. The results from this experiment indicate that\nhumans should operate above a threshold frame rate of 5 frames per second. In a\nseparate, but similar experiment, we introduced a 2.6 second delay in the video\nsystem. This delay recreated the latency conditions present when operating\nrovers on the lunar farside from an Earth-based command station. This time\ndelay was compared to low-latency conditions for teleoperation at the DSG\n($\\leq$0.4 seconds). The results from this experiment show a 150% increase in\nexploration time when the latency is increased to 2.6 seconds. This indicates\nthat such a delay significantly complicates real-time exploration strategies.",

Disordered hyperuniform heterogeneous materials are new,\nexotic amorphous matter that behave like crystals in the manner in which they\nsuppress volume-fraction fluctuations at large length scales, and yet are\nisotropic with no Bragg peaks. In this paper, we formulate for the first time a\nFourier-space numerical construction procedure to design at will a wide class\nof disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with prescribed spectral\ndensities, which enables one to tune the degree and length scales at which this\nsuppression occurs. We demonstrate that the anomalous suppression of\nvolume-fraction fluctuations in such two-phase materials endow them with novel\nand often optimal transport and electromagnetic properties. Specifically, we\nconstruct a family of phase-inversion-symmetric materials with variable\ntopological connectedness properties that remarkably achieves a well-known\nexplicit formula for the effective electrical (thermal) conductivity. Moreover,\nwe design disordered stealthy hyperuniform dispersion that possesses nearly\noptimal effective conductivity while being statistically isotropic.\nInterestingly, all of our designed materials are transparent to electromagnetic\nradiation for certain wavelengths, which is a common attribute of all\nhyperuniform materials. Our constructed materials can be readily realized by 3D\nprinting and lithographic technologies. We expect that our designs will be\npotentially useful for energy-saving materials, batteries and aerospace\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A Global Enhanced Vibrational Kinetic (GEVKM) model is presented for a new\nHigh Current Negative Hydrogen Ion Source (HCNHIS) developed by Busek Co. Inc.\nand Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The HCNHIS consists of a high-pressure\nradio-frequency discharge (RFD) chamber where high-lying vibrational states of\nthe hydrogen molecules are produced, a bypass system, a nozzle, and a\nlow-pressure negative hydrogen ion production region where $\\text{H}^-$ are\ngenerated by the dissociative attachment of low energy electrons to\nrovibrationally excited hydrogen molecules. The GEVKM is developed from moment\nequations for multi-temperature chemically reacting plasmas derived from the\nWang Chang-Uhlenbeck equations for a cylindrical geometry of an inductively\ncoupled RFD chamber. The species included into the model are $\\text{H}(n),\nn=0-3, \\text{H}_2(v), v=0-14, \\text{H}^+, \\text{H}_2^+, \\text{H}_3^+,\n\\text{H}^-$, and $e$. The volume-averaged steady-state continuity equations\ncoupled with the electron energy equation, the total energy equation and heat\ntransfer to the chamber walls are solved simultaneously to obtain the\nvolume-averaged number densities of the plasma components, the electron,\nheavy-particle and wall temperatures. The GEVKM is supplemented by a\ncomprehensive set of surface and volumetric chemical processes governing\nvibrational and ionization kinetics of hydrogen plasmas. Analytic boundary\nconditions developed for the flow in the bypass tubes and in the nozzle take\ninto account rarefaction effects and are validated by comparing pressures\npredictions in the RFD chamber with the pressure measurements. The GEVKM is\nverified and validated in the wide range of pressures and absorbed powers of\ndifferent plasma reactors and is used in a parametric investigation of the RFD\nchamber of the HCNHIS with hydrogen inlet flow rates 5-1000 sccm and absorbed\npowers 200-1000 W.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We propose a primal-dual interior-point (PDIP) method for solving quadratic\nprogramming problems with linear inequality constraints that typically arise\nform MPC applications. We show that the solver converges (locally)\nquadratically to a suboptimal solution of the MPC problem. PDIP solvers rely on\ntwo phases: the damped and the pure Newton phases. Compared to state-of-the-art\nPDIP methods, our solver replaces the initial damped Newton phase (usually used\nto compute a medium-accuracy solution) with a dual solver based on Nesterov's\nfast gradient scheme (DFG) that converges with a sublinear convergence rate of\norder O(1/k^2) to a medium-accuracy solution. The switching strategy to the\npure Newton phase, compared to the state of the art, is computed in the dual\nspace to exploit the dual information provided by the DFG in the first phase.\nRemoving the damped Newton phase has the additional advantage that our solver\nsaves the computational effort required by backtracking line search. The\neffectiveness of the proposed solver is demonstrated on a 2-dimensional\ndiscrete-time unstable system and on an aerospace application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  It is shown that replacing the sinusoidal chip in Golay complementary code\npairs by special classes of waveforms that satisfy two conditions,\nsymmetry/anti-symmetry and quazi-orthogonality in the convolution sense,\nrenders the complementary codes immune to frequency selective fading and also\nallows for concatenating them in time using one frequency band/channel. This\nresults in a zero-sidelobe region around the mainlobe and an adjacent region of\nsmall cross-correlation sidelobes. The symmetry/anti-symmetry property results\nin the zero-sidelobe region on either side of the mainlobe, while\nquasi-orthogonality of the two chips keeps the adjacent region of\ncross-correlations small. Such codes are constructed using discrete\nfrequency-coding waveforms (DFCW) based on linear frequency modulation (LFM)\nand piecewise LFM (PLFM) waveforms as chips for the complementary code pair, as\nthey satisfy both the symmetry/anti-symmetry and quasi-orthogonality\nconditions. It is also shown that changing the slopes/chirp rates of the DFCW\nwaveforms (based on LFM and PLFM waveforms) used as chips with the same\ncomplementary code pair results in good code sets with a zero-sidelobe region.\nIt is also shown that a second good code set with a zero-sidelobe region could\nbe constructed from the mates of the complementary code pair, while using the\nsame DFCW waveforms as their chips. The cross-correlation between the two sets\nis shown to contain a zero-sidelobe region and an adjacent region of small\ncross-correlation sidelobes. Thus, the two sets are quasi-orthogonal and could\nbe combined to form a good code set with twice the number of codes without\naffecting their cross-correlation properties. Or a better good code set with\nthe same number codes could be constructed by choosing the best candidates form\nthe two sets. Such code sets find utility in multiple input-multiple output\n(MIMO) radar applications.",
