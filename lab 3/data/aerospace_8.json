    "abstract": "Abstract:  Hyper-viscoelastic polymers have multiple areas of application including\naerospace, biomedicine, and automotive. Their mechanical responses are\ntherefore extremely important to understand, particularly because they exhibit\nstrong rate and temperature dependence, including a low temperature brittle\ntransition. Relationships between the response at various strain rates and\ntemperatures are investigated and a framework developed to predict large strain\nresponse at rates of c. 1000 s$^{-1}$ and above where experiments are\nunfeasible. A master curve of the storage modulus's rate dependence at a\nreference temperature is constructed using a DMA test of the polymer. A\nfrequency sweep spanning two decades and a temperature range from pre-glass\ntransition to pre-melt is used. A fractional derivative model is fitted to the\nexperimental data, and this model's parameters are used to derive stress-strain\nrelationships at a desired strain rate.",

We consider both co-located and separated transmitter/receiver\npairs, i.e., mono-static and bi-static configurations, respectively, as well as\nmulti-static settings involving both types. We propose a detection approach\nwhich is capable of coherently integrating these reflections within a coherent\nprocessing interval (CPI) in all these configurations and continuing\nintegration for an arbitrarily long time across consecutive CPIs. We estimate\nthe complex value of the reflection coefficients for integration while\nsimultaneously estimating the object trajectory. Compounded with this is the\nestimation of the unknown time reference shift of the separated transmitters\nnecessary for coherent processing. Detection is made by using the resulting\nintegration value in a Neyman-Pearson test against a constant false alarm rate\nthreshold. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulation example\nwith a very low SNR object which cannot be detected with conventional\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The problem of detecting changes with multiple sensors has received\nsignificant attention in the literature. In many practical applications such as\ncritical infrastructure monitoring and modeling of disease spread, a useful\nchange propagation model is one where change eventually happens at all sensors,\nbut where not all sensors witness change at the same time instant. While prior\nwork considered the case of known change propagation dynamics, this paper\nstudies a more general setting of unknown change propagation pattern\n(trajectory). A Bayesian formulation of the problem in both centralized and\ndecentralized settings is studied with the goal of detecting the first time\ninstant at which any sensor witnesses a change. Using the dynamic programming\n(DP) framework, the optimal solution structure is derived and in the rare\nchange regime, several more practical change detection algorithms are proposed.\nUnder certain conditions, the first-order asymptotic optimality of a proposed\nalgorithm called multichart test is shown as the false alarm probability\nvanishes. To further reduce the computational complexity, change detection\nalgorithms are proposed based on online estimation of the unknown change\npropagation pattern. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed detection\ntechniques offer near-optimal performance. Further, in the decentralized\nsetting, it is shown that if an event-triggered sampling scheme called\nlevel-crossing sampling with hysteresis (LCSH) is used for sampling and\ntransmission of local statistics, the detection performance can be\nsignificantly improved using the same amount of communication resources\ncompared to the conventional uniform-in-time sampling (US) scheme.",

This requires a high-fidelity mesh containing at\nleast four layers of quadratic elements across each ply and interface layer,\nunderlining the need for dune-composites, which can achieve run times of just\nover 2 minutes on 2048 cores for realistic composites problems with 173 million\ndegrees of freedom.",

However,\nthe increased communication demand will require radically new methods to ease\ncommunication congestion. Networks of communication relay satellites located at\nstrategic locations such as geostationary orbit and Lagrange points are\npotential solutions. Instead of one large communication relay satellite, we\ncould have scores of small satellites that utilize phase arrays to effectively\noperate as one large satellite. Excess payload capacity on rockets can be used\nto warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage\nof this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or\ndestroyed, the network still operates but with degraded performance. The\nsatellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some\nsatellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple\ntargets at once. The potential for this alternate communication architecture is\nsignificant, but this requires development of satellite formation flying and\nnetworking technologies.

Despite a strong desire to supplant many\naerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely\nremained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical\ncomponents. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive\nprocessing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous\nchallenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships\nthrough precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback\ncontrol. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic\nlayers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material\nspecifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control\nsystem, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently\nevolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic\nspecifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly\ncoupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required\nparameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can\nbe modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications. Therefore, the\nrepresentation of what is printed changes during the printing process to\ncompensate for eventual imprecision or drift arising during the manufacturing\nprocess.",

A\nrandom-walk process is employed to model the phase ambiguities in order to\nabsorb the time-varying and satellite-specific higher-order measurement errors\nas well as the GPS clock correction errors. A sequential Kalman filter which\nincorporates the known orbital dynamic model is developed to estimate orbital\nstates and phase ambiguities without matrix inversion. Real flight data from\nthe single-frequency GPS receiver onboard China's SJ-9A small satellite are\nprocessed to evaluate the orbit determination accuracy.

The\ncomputational setup, inspired by the experimental setup of Miura et al., Phys.\nRev.

The\ncorresponding initial temperature values are taken along the pseudo-boiling\nline. Thermodynamic and transport properties of CO2 in near-critical conditions\nare modeled via the Peng-Robinson equation of state and Chung's Method. A heat\nsource is applied at a distance from one end, with heat release intensities\nspanning the range 10^3-10^11 W/m^2, generating isentropic compression waves\nfor values < 10^9 W/m^2. For higher heat-release rates such compressions are\ncoalescent with distinct shock-like features (e.g. non-isentropicity and\npropagation Mach numbers measurably greater than unity) and a non-uniform\npost-shock state is present due to the strong thermodynamic nonlinearities. The\nresulting compression wave intensities have been collapsed via the thermal\nexpansion coefficient, highly variable in near-critical fluids, used as one of\nthe scaling parameters for the reference energy. The proposed scaling applies\nto isentropic thermoacoustic waves as well as shock waves up to shock strength\n2. Long-term time integration reveals resonance behavior of the compression\nwaves, raising the mean pressure and temperature at every resonance cycle. When\nthe heat injection is halted, expansion waves are generated, which counteract\nthe compression waves leaving conduction as the only thermal relaxation\nprocess. In the long term evolution, the decay in amplitude of the resonating\nwaves observed in the experiments is qualitatively reproduced by using\nisothermal boundary conditions.",

RF is a well-established and well-regulated technology that enables\ncommunication over long distances as proven by the Voyager 1 & II missions.\nHowever, RF requires licensing of very limited radio spectrum and this poses a\nchallenge in the future, particularly with spectrum time-sharing. This is of a\nconcern for emergency communication when it is of utmost urgency to contact the\nspacecraft and maintain contact, particularly when there is a major mission\nanomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser\ncommunication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the\nonboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser\nground station to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency.\nAdding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables\ntwo-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser\nbeing located on the spacecraft. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of\nthe concept in the laboratory and develop a benchtop experiment to verify the\nconcept. We have also developed a preliminary design for a 6U CubeSat-based\ndemonstrator to evaluate technology merits",

Thermal and viscous boundary layers (order of 10\n$\\mathrm{\\mu}$m) are resolved. Vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation\nare modeled with an effective bulk viscosity coefficient modifying the viscous\nstress tensor. The effective bulk viscosity coefficient is estimated from the\ndifference between theoretical and semi-empirical attenuation curves.\nContributions to the effective bulk viscosity coefficient can be identified as\nfrom vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation. The inclusion of the\ncoefficient captures acoustic absorption from infrasonic ($\\sim$10 Hz) to\nultrasonic ($\\sim$100 kHz) frequencies. The value of bulk viscosity depends on\npressure, temperature, and frequency, as well as the relative humidity of the\nworking fluid. Simulations of the TAE are carried out to the limit cycle, with\ngrowth rates and limit-cycle amplitudes varying non-monotonically with the\nmagnitude of bulk viscosity, reaching a maximum for a relative humidity level\nof 5%. A corresponding linear model with minor losses was developed; the linear\nmodel overpredicts transient growth rate but gives an accurate estimate of\nlimit cycle behavior.

As the UAVs communicate to reach consensus\non their states while making the formation, the communication network among the\nUAVs makes them vulnerable to a potential attack from malicious adversaries.\nTwo types of attacks pertinent to a network of UAVs have been considered: a\nnode attack on the UAVs and a deception attack on the communication between the\nUAVs. UAVs formation control presented using a consensus algorithm to reach a\npre-specified formation. A node and a communication path deception cyber\nattacks on the UAV's network are considered with their respective models in the\nformation setup. For these cyber attacks detection, a bank of Unknown Input\nObserver (UIO) based distributed fault detection scheme proposed to detect and\nidentify the compromised UAV in the formation. A rule based on the residuals\ngenerated using the bank of UIOs are used to detect attacks and identify the\ncompromised UAV in the formation. Further, an algorithm developed to remove the\nfaulty UAV from the network once an attack detected and the compromised UAV\nisolated while maintaining the formation flight with a missing UAV node.",

Geometric optimal control is a theory combining\noptimal control with various concepts of differential geometry. The ultimate\nobjective is to derive optimal synthesis results for general classes of control\nsystems. Continuation or homotopy methods consist in solving a series of\nparameterized problems, starting from a simple one to end up by continuous\ndeformation with the initial problem. They help overcoming the difficult\ninitialization issues of the shooting method. The combination of geometric\ncontrol and homotopy methods improves the traditional techniques of optimal\ncontrol theory. A nonacademic example of optimal attitude-trajectory control of\n(classical and airborne) launch vehicles, treated in details, illustrates how\ngeometric optimal control can be used to analyze finely the structure of the\nextremals. This theoretical analysis helps building an efficient numerical\nsolution procedure combining shooting methods and numerical continuation.\nChattering is also analyzed and it is shown how to deal with this issue in\npractice.",

However, they suffer from cosmic\nradiation induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In safety-critical applications,\nthe dependability of the design is a prime concern since failures may have\ncatastrophic consequences. An early analysis of the relationship between\ndependability metrics, performability-area trade-off, and different mitigation\ntechniques for such applications can reduce the design effort while increasing\nthe design confidence. This paper introduces a novel methodology based on\nprobabilistic model checking, for the analysis of the reliability,\navailability, safety and performance-area tradeoffs of safety-critical systems\nfor early design decisions. Starting from the high-level description of a\nsystem, a Markov reward model is constructed from the Control Data Flow Graph\n(CDFG) and a component characterization library targeting FPGAs. The proposed\nmodel and exhaustive analysis capture all the failure states (based on the\nfault detection coverage) and repairs possible in the system. We present\nquantitative results based on an FIR filter circuit to illustrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach and to demonstrate that a wide range of\nuseful dependability and performability properties can be analyzed using the\nproposed methodology. The modeling results show the relationship between\ndifferent mitigation techniques and fault detection coverage, exposing their\ndirect impact on the design for early decisions.",

A common technique to verify programs\nis the analysis of their abstract syntax tree (AST). Tree structures can be\nelegantly analyzed with the logic programming language Prolog. Moreover, Prolog\noffers further advantages for a thorough analysis: On the one hand, it natively\nprovides versatile options to efficiently process tree or graph data\nstructures. On the other hand, Prolog's non-determinism and backtracking eases\ntests of different variations of the program flow without big effort. A\nrule-based approach with Prolog allows to characterize the verification goals\nin a concise and declarative way.\nIn this paper, we describe our approach to verify the source code of a flash\nfile system with the help of Prolog. The flash file system is written in C++\nand has been developed particularly for the use in satellites. We transform a\ngiven abstract syntax tree of C++ source code into Prolog facts and derive the\ncall graph and the execution sequence (tree), which then are further tested\nagainst verification goals. The different program flow branching due to control\nstructures is derived by backtracking as subtrees of the full execution\nsequence. Finally, these subtrees are verified in Prolog.\nWe illustrate our approach with a case study, where we search for incorrect\napplications of semaphores in embedded software using the real-time operating\nsystem RODOS.

An efficient methodology for\nautomatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage\nof the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS)\nmethod. Based on the simultaneous spectral decomposition of two scatter\nmatrices, ICS leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the\nEuclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original\ncoordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments\nin a context where the dimension of the data is large. Unlike MD, ICS makes it\npossible to select relevant components which removes the limitations. Owing to\nthe resulting dimension reduction, the method is expected to improve the power\nof outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. It also greatly\nsimplifies outliers interpretation. The paper includes practical guidelines for\nusing ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers which is relevant in\nhigh reliability standards fields. The choice of scatter matrices together with\nthe selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and\nnormality tests are addressed. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the\nso called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This\nchoice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility\nto derive theoretical results. A simulation study confirms the good properties\nof the proposal and compares it with other scatter pairs. This study also\nprovides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance\nof our proposal is also evaluated on several real data sets using a\nuser-friendly R package accompanying the paper.",

In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a\nmodel that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible\nflight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework\nis based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics\nand aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state\ncharacterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack,\nforming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class\nof Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit\nanalytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and,\nhence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype\nbio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind\ntunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor\nnetworks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing\ncapabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the\nidentification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model\nparameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector\ndefined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to\nsuccessfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the\nadmissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared\nto standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the\nhigh accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification\nframework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of\nfly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities.",

Methods: By\nreference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens\nseeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure\nthe germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and\nexpression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower\nreaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct\ndifference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms\nof germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the\nrelative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene\nSoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the\nmutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can\nfurther cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:\nIn this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens\nimproves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained\nimpatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher\napplication value in garden virescence.",
