Our\nanalysis identifies the particles in the dust cloud surrounding Ganymede by\ntheir impact direction, impact velocity, and mass distribution and implies that\nthey have been kicked up by hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids onto the\nsatellite's surface. We calculate the radial density profile of the particles\nejected from the satellite by interplanetary dust grains. We assume the yields,\nmass and velocity distributions of the ejecta obtained from laboratory impact\nexperiments onto icy targets and consider the dynamics of the ejected grains in\nballistic and escaping trajectories near Ganymede. The spatial dust density\nprofile calculated with interplanetary particles as impactors is consistent\nwith the profile derived from the Galileo measurements. The contribution of\ninterstellar grains as projectiles is negligible. Dust measurements in the\nvicinities of satellites by spacecraft detectors are suggested as a beneficial\ntool to obtain more knowledge about the satellite surfaces, as well as dusty\nplanetary rings maintained by satellites through the impact ejecta mechanism.",

In order to determine u(X), we only need to know the statistical\ndistributions of X and Y. We show that u(X) is the change of variables that\nconverts the distribution of X into the distribution of Y, while conserving\nprobability. We describe an algorithm for implementing this method and apply it\nto several example distributions. We also demonstrate how the method can\nseparate spatial and temporal variations from a time series of energetic\nelectron flux measurements made by a spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit. We\nexpect this method will be useful to the general problem of spacecraft\ninstrument calibration. We also suggest some applications of the SAR method\noutside of space physics.",

In this paper\nwe investigate how the changes in frequencies of low-degree modes obtained by\nfitting symmetric and asymmetric peak profiles change the inferred properties\nof the solar core. We use data obtained by the Global Oscillations at Low\nFrequencies (GOLF) project on board the SoHO spacecraft. Two different solar\nmodels and inversion procedures are used to invert the data to determine the\nsound speed in the solar core.

This entails relaxation, i.e., decrease of the rotational energy,\nwith the angular momentum preserved. The spin about the major-inertia axis\ncorresponds to the minimal kinetic energy, for a fixed angular momentum. Thence\none may expect comets and asteroids (as well as spacecraft or cosmic-dust\ngranules) stay in this, so-called principal, state of rotation, unless they are\nforced out of this state by a collision, or a tidal interaction, or cometary\njetting, or by whatever other reason. As is well known, comet P/Halley,\nasteroid 4179 Toutatis, and some other small bodies exhibit very complex\nrotational motions attributed to these objects being in non-principal states of\nspin. Most probably, the asteroid and cometary wobble is quite a generic\nphenomenon. The theory of wobble with internal dissipation has not been fully\ndeveloped as yet. In this article we demonstrate that in some spin states the\neffectiveness of the inelastic-dissipation process is several orders of\nmagnitude higher than believed previously, and can be measured, by the\npresently available observational instruments, within approximately a year\nspan. We also show that in some other spin states both the precession and\nprecession-relaxation processes slow down considerably. (We call it\nnear-separatrix lingering effect.) Such spin states may evolve so slowly that\nthey can mimic the principal-rotation state.",

This\nprediction has a number of observable consequences, none of which are in\nconflict with observation. In this paper we compare test particle motion in the\nnonstatic gravitational field outside a spherically symmetric source (as\npredicted by a quasi-metric theory of gravity) to test particle motion in the\nSchwarzschild geometry. It is found that if one incorrectly uses the\nSchwarzschild geometry (to the relevant accuracy) to represent the nonstatic\nquasi-metric model, the largest errors result from the mismodelling of null\npaths. One consequence of this is that using electromagnetic signals to track\nthe motion of a non-relativistic particle results in the illusion that the\nparticle is influenced by an anomalous force of size cH (where H is the Hubble\nparameter) directed towards the observer. This result naturally explains the\napparently anomalous force acting on the Pioneer 10/11, Galileo and Ulysses\nspacecraft as inferred from radiometric data.",

A non-linear Monte Carlo technique\nwas employed which in effect solves the Boltzmann equation and is not\nrestricted to near isotropic particle distribution functions. This technique\nmodels the injection of thermal and pickup ions, the acceleration of these\nions, and the determination of the shock structure under the influence of the\naccelerated ions. The essential effects of injection are treated in a mostly\nself-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-field\ndiffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. Using recent determinations of pickup\nion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs\nby assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination\nshock, are much less than an AU and that moderately strong cross-field\ndiffusion occurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He$^{+}$/H$^+$ or\nO$^{+}$/H$^+$ to within a factor ~ 3. If the conditions of strong scattering\napply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and the injection\nand acceleration of pickup ions at the termination shock is totally analogous\nto the injection and acceleration of ions at highly oblique interplanetary\nshocks recently observed by the Ulysses spacecraft.",

Phase folded light curves at a barycentric rotation period of\n124.36568 +/- 0.00020 seconds show that near the center of the extended minimum\nthe source stopped pulsing in the traditional sense but retained a weak dip\nfeature at the rotation period. Away from the extended minimum the dips are\nprogressively narrower at higher energies and may be interpreted as\nobscurations or eclipses of the hot spot by the accretion column. The pulse\nprofile changed from leading-edge bright before the extended minimum to\ntrailing-edge bright after it. Data from the Burst and Transient Source\nExperiment (BATSE) show that a torque reversal occurred <10 days after our\nobservation. Our data indicate that the observed rotation departs from a\nconstant period with a Pdot/P value of ~-1.5% per year at a 4.5 sigma\nsignificance.

The mass of an impacting dust grain is derived from its impact velocity\nand the amount of plasma generated by the impact. Because the initial velocity\nand the dynamics of interstellar particles in the Solar System are well known,\nwe use an approximated theoretical instead of the measured impact velocity to\nderive the mass of interstellar grains from the Ulysses and Galileo in-situ\ndata.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The gas-to-dust mass ratios found for interstellar dust within the Solar\nSystem, versus values determined astronomically for the cloud around the Solar\nSystem, suggest that large and small interstellar grains have separate\nhistories, and that large interstellar grains preferentially detected by\nspacecraft are not formed exclusively by mass exchange with nearby interstellar\ngas. Observations by the Ulysses and Galileo satellites of the mass spectrum\nand flux rate of interstellar dust within the heliosphere are combined with\ninformation about the density, composition, and relative flow speed and\ndirection of interstellar gas in the cloud surrounding the solar system to\nderive an in situ value for the gas-to-dust mass ratio, $R_{g/d} =\n94^{+46}_{-38}$. Hubble observations of the cloud surrounding the solar system\nyield a gas-to-dust mass ratio of Rg/d=551+61-251 when B-star reference\nabundances are assumed. The exclusion of small dust grains from the heliosheath\nand heliosphere regions are modeled, increasing the discrepancy between\ninterstellar and in situ observations. The shock destruction of interstellar\ngrains is considered, and comparisons are made with interplanetary and presolar\ndust grains.",

Here it is proposed that gamma-ray bursts\nmay well the best ``synchronizers'' of all currently known phenomena due to\ntheir large intrinsic luminosities, high occurrence rate, isotropic sky\ndistribution, large distance from the Galaxy, short duration, and easy\ndetectability. For targeted searches, precise positions for gamma-ray bursts\nare required together with precise distance measurements to a target star. The\nrequired burst position determinations are now starting to be obtained, aided\nin large part by the discovery of optical afterglows. Good distance\nmeasurements are currently available from Hipparcos and even better\nmeasurements should be provided by spacecraft now being developed. For\nnon-targeted searches, positional accuracies simply better than a detector's\nfield of view may suffice but the time delay between the detection of a\ngamma-ray burst and the reception of the transmitted signal cannot be predicted\nin an obvious way.",

If changes in this frequency are interpreted as a Doppler\nshift the result is an apparent acceleration directed towards the sun.

When combined with Milky Way\nGalaxy microlensing results, almost the entire plausible range of massive\ncompact baryonic objects is excluded by direct observation. Deep direct imaging\nat 7mu and 15mu with ISOCAM on the ISO spacecraft directly excludes\nhydrogen-burning stars of any mass above the hydrogen-burning limit, and of any\nchemical abundance, from being the predominant explanation of the dark halos of\nexternal spiral galaxies. In the Milky Way Galaxy, HST has provided luminosity\nfunctions to the hydrogen-burning limit in several globular clusters. The\nresulting mass functions do not provide any support for dominance by very\nlow-mass stars. This is consistent with field surveys for sub-stellar mass\nbrown dwarfs, which show such objects to be relatively rare. These results are\ncomplemented by very deep HST luminosity functions in the Large Magellanic\nCloud, providing strong support for the (near)-universality of the stellar mass\nfunction. Very recent HST results are available for the nearby dSph galaxy UMi.\nThis galaxy, the most dark-matter dominated object known on kpc scales, has a\nnormal stellar mass function at low masses. The prospects are bright for dark\nelementary particles.",

It now seems that\nmany asteroids are little more than rubble piles, held together by\nself-gravity; this means that their shapes may be strongly distorted by tides\nduring close encounters with planets. Here we report on numerical simulations\nof encounters between a ellipsoid-shaped rubble-pile asteroid and the Earth.\nAfter an encounter, many of the simulated asteroids develop the same rotation\nrate and distinctive shape (i.e., highly elongated with a single convex side,\ntapered ends, and small protuberances swept back against the rotation\ndirection) as 1620 Geographos. Since our numerical studies show that these\nevents occur with some frequency, we suggest that Geographos may be a tidally\ndistorted object. In addition, our work shows that 433 Eros, which will be\nvisited by the NEAR spacecraft in 1999, is much like Geographos, which suggests\nthat it too may have been molded by tides in the past.",
