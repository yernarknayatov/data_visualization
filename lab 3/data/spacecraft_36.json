    "abstract": "Abstract:  Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM), also broadly known as 3D printing, is a\nnew technology to produce 3D objects. As an opposite approach to the\nconventional subtractive manufacturing process, 3D objects are created by\nadding thin material layers over layers. Until recently, they have been used,\nmainly, for plastic models. However, the technology has evolved making it\npossible to use high-quality printing with metal alloys. Agencies and companies\nlike NASA, ESA, Boeing, Airbus, etc. are investigating various ALM technology\napplication areas. Recently, SpaceX used additive manufacturing to produce\nengine chambers for the newest Dragon spacecraft. BAE System plans to print\non-demand a complete Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), depending on the\noperational requirements. Companies expect the implementation of ALM technology\nwill bring a broad variety of technological and economic benefits. This\nincludes, but not limited to, the reduction of the time needed to produce\ncomplex parts, reduction of wasted material and thus control of production\ncosts along with minimization of part storage space as companies implement\njust-in-time and on-demand production solutions. The broad variety of\napplication areas and a high grade of computerization of the manufacturing\nprocess will inevitably make ALM an attractive target for various attacks.",

A strong\nisolated wavepacket is found to be in accordance with the four Cluster\nsatellites crossing an Alfv\u00e9n vortex, a nonlinear solution to the\nincompressible MHD equations. A strong agreement is seen between the data from\nfour satellites and a model vortex with a radius of the order of $40$ times the\nlocal proton gyro-radii. The polarization at different spacecraft is compared\nand is found to agree with the vortex model, whereas it cannot be explained\nsolely by the linear plane wave approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  General relativity is supported by great experimental evidence. Yet there is\na lot of interest in precisely setting its limits with on going and future\nexperiments. A question to answer is about the validity of the Strong\nEquivalence Principle. Ground experiments and Lunar Laser Ranging have provided\nthe best upper limit on the Nordtvedt parameter $\\sigma[\\eta]=4.4\\times\n10^{-4}$. With the future planetary mission BepiColombo, this parameter will be\nfurther improved by at least an order of magnitude. In this paper we envisage\nyet another possible testing environment with spacecraft ranging towards the\nnearby Sun-Earth collinear Lagrangian points. Neglecting errors in planetary\nmasses and ephemerides, we forecast $\\sigma[\\eta]=6.4\\,(2.0)\\times10^{-4}$ (5\nyr integration time) via ranging towards $L_1$ in a realistic (optimistic)\nscenario depending on current (future) range capabilities and knowledge of the\nEarth's ephemerides. A combined measurement, $L_1$+$L_2$, gives instead\n$4.8\\,(1.7)\\times10^{-4}$. In the optimistic scenario a single measurement of\none year would be enough to reach $\\approx3\\times10^{-4}$. All figures are\ncomparable with Lunar Laser Ranging, but worse than BepiColombo. Performances\ncould be much improved if data were integrated over time and over the number of\nsatellites flying around either of the two Lagrangian points. We point out that\nsome systematics (gravitational perturbations of other planets or figure\neffects) are much more in control compared to other experiments. We do not\nadvocate a specific mission to constrain the Strong Equivalence Principle, but\nwe do suggest analysing ranging data of present and future spacecrafts flying\naround $L_1$/$L_2$ (one key mission is, for instance, LISA Pathfinder). This\nspacecraft ranging would be a new and complementary probe to constrain the\nStrong Equivalence Principle in space.",

We also quantify beam-driven\nlaunch to the outer solar system, interstellar precursors and ultimately\nstarships. We estimate the principal observable parameters of power beaming\nleakage. Extraterrestrial civilizations would know their power beams could be\nobserved, and so could put a message on the power beam and broadcast it for our\nreceipt at little additional energy or cost. By observing leakage from power\nbeams we may find a message embedded on the beam. Recent observations of the\nanomalous star KIC8462852 by the Allen Telescope Array set some limits on\nextraterrestrial power beaming in that system. We show that most power beaming\napplications commensurate with those suggested for our solar system would be\ndetectable if using the frequency range monitored by the ATA, and so the lack\nof detection is a meaningful, if modest, constraint on extraterrestrial power\nbeaming in that system. Until more extensive observations are made, the limited\nobservation time and frequency coverage are not sufficiently broad in frequency\nand duration to produce firm conclusions. Such beams would be visible over\nlarge interstellar distances. This implies a new approach to the SETI search:\nInstead of focusing on narrowband beacon transmissions generated by another\ncivilization, look for more powerful beams with much wider bandwidth. This\nrequires a new approach for their discovery by telescopes on Earth. Further\nstudies of power beaming applications should be done, which could broaden the\nparameter space of observable features we have discussed here.",

Yet, standard techniques for\nidentifying dynamical asteroid families have not detected any Ceres family. In\nthis work, we argue that linear secular resonances with Ceres deplete the\npopulation of objects near Ceres. Also, because of the high escape velocity\nfrom Ceres, family members are expected to be very dispersed, with a\nconsiderable fraction of km-sized fragments that should be able to reach the\npristine region of the main belt, the area between the 5J:-2A and 7J:-3A\nmean-motion resonances, where the observed number of asteroids is low. Rather\nthan looking for possible Ceres family members near Ceres, here we propose to\nsearch in the pristine region.

This is particularly evident under buckling\n(stability) constraints. The goal is to develop a finite element-based\noptimization approach which can be used to optimize each component of a large,\nprimary structure assembly.

In total 475 shocks are listed. To determine the particle\nacceleration efficiency of these shocks, we analyze the associated intensity\nincreases (shock spikes) during the shock crossings. For the near-relativistic\nelectrons, we take into account the issue of possible ion contamination in the\nSEPT instrument. Results. The highest acceleration efficiency is found for low\nenergy ions (0.1 MeV), which show a shock-associated increase at 27% of all\nshocks. The 2 MeV ions show an associated increase only during 5% of the shock\ncrossings.

For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud\nassuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity\nversions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external\ngravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external\nfield is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect\n(EFE). Adopting the popular pair $\\nu(x)=[1-\\exp(-x^{1/2})]^{-1}$ for the MD\ninterpolating function and $a_{0}=1.2\\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for the MD\nacceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian cloud\nof comets is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The\ncomets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide\ncan torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an\nobstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE\ncan induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a\ncomet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function\nfamilies and a revised value of $a_{0}$ (provided recently by the Cassini\nspacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in\nconclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its\noverall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the\nJupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a\nsignificant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like\norbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible\nin MD. In MD, they both belong to the same population, just in different modes\nof their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The ESA Rosetta spacecraft, currently orbiting around comet 67P, has already\nprovided in situ measurements of the dust grain properties from several\ninstruments, particularly OSIRIS and GIADA. We propose adding value to those\nmeasurements by combining them with ground-based observations of the dust tail\nto monitor the overall, time-dependent dust-production rate and size\ndistribution. To constrain the dust grain properties, we take Rosetta OSIRIS\nand GIADA results into account, and combine OSIRIS data during the approach\nphase (from late April to early June 2014) with a large data set of\nground-based images that were acquired with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nfrom February to November 2014. A Monte Carlo dust tail code has been applied\nto retrieve the dust parameters. Key properties of the grains (density,\nvelocity, and size distribution) were obtained from Rosetta observations: these\nparameters were used as input of the code to considerably reduce the number of\nfree parameters. In this way, the overall dust mass-loss rate and its\ndependence on the heliocentric distance could be obtained accurately. The dust\nparameters derived from the inner coma measurements by OSIRIS and GIADA and\nfrom distant imaging using VLT data are consistent, except for the power index\nof the size-distribution function, which is $\\alpha$=--3, instead of\n$\\alpha$=--2, for grains smaller than 1 mm. This is possibly linked to the\npresence of fluffy aggregates in the coma. The onset of cometary activity\noccurs at approximately 4.3 au, with a dust production rate of 0.5 kg/s,\nincreasing up to 15 kg/s at 2.9 au. This implies a dust-to-gas mass ratio\nvarying between 3.8 and 6.5 for the best-fit model when combined with\nwater-production rates from the MIRO experiment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Moon Zoo is a citizen science project that utilises internet crowd-sourcing\ntechniques. Moon Zoo users are asked to review high spatial resolution images\nfrom the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), onboard NASAs LRO\nspacecraft, and perform characterisation such as measuring impact crater sizes\nand identify morphological features of interest. The tasks are designed to\naddress issues in lunar science and to aid future exploration of the Moon. We\nhave tested various methodologies and parameters therein to interrogate and\nreduce the Moon Zoo crater location and size dataset against a validated expert\nsurvey. We chose the Apollo 17 region as a test area since it offers a broad\nrange of cratered terrains, including secondary-rich areas, older maria, and\nuplands. The assessment involved parallel testing in three key areas: (1)\nfiltering of data to remove problematic mark-ups; (2) clustering methods of\nmultiple notations per crater; and (3) derivation of alternative crater\ndegradation indices, based on the statistical variability of multiple notations\nand the smoothness of local image structures. We compared different\ncombinations of methods and parameters and assessed correlations between\nresulting crater summaries and the expert census.\nWe derived the optimal data reduction steps and settings of the existing Moon\nZoo crater data to agree with the expert census. Further, the regolith depth\nand crater degradation states derived from the data are also found to be in\nbroad agreement with other estimates for the Apollo 17 region. Our study\nsupports the validity of this citizen science project but also recommends\nimprovements in key elements of the data acquisition planning and production.",

Drag-free technology is one of the\ntechnologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose\nlaunch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is\ndefined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a\nnatural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core\nis an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free\norbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from\ndisturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a\nconcept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites. At the same time, a\ndrag-free motion is required in many missions of fundamental physics. eLISA is\nan ESA concept mission aimed at opening a new window to the universe, black\nholes, and massive binary systems by means of gravitational waves.\nLISA-Pathfinder is in charge of proving the eLISA concept. In this frame, the\nsystem holding the TM during launch and releasing it in free-fall before the\nscience phase represents a single point of failure for the whole mission. This\nthesis describes the phenomena, operations, issues, tests, activities, and\nsimulations linked to the release following a system engineering approach.\nExperimental studies have been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in\nconditions representative of the LISA-Pathfinder flight environment. The last\npart of the thesis is dedicated to the preliminary design of the housing of the\nTM in the frame of a low-cost mission conceived at Stanford (USA). The ambition\nof this work is increasing the maturity of the technology needed in drag-free\nprojects and therefore provide a starting point for future fascinating and\nchallenging missions of this kind.",

We discuss the physical\nparameters of the jets and their relation with other phenomena such as H alpha\nsurges, nonthermal type III radio bursts and hard X-ray emission. Using AIA\nwavelength channels sensitive to coronal temperatures, we studied the\ntemperature distribution in the jets using the line-of-sight Differential\nEmission Measure technique. We also investigated the role of the photospheric\nmagnetic field using the LOS magnetogram data from the HMI. The lifetime of\njets range from 5 to 39 minutes with an average of 18 minutes and their\nvelocities range from 87 to 532 km/s with an average of 271 km/s. Most of the\njets are co-temporal with nonthermal type III radio bursts observed by the\nWind/WAVES spacecraft. We confirm the source region of these bursts using the\nPotential Field Source Surface technique. 10 out of 20 events showed that the\njets originated in a region of flux cancellation and 6 jets in a region of flux\nemergence. 4 events showed flux emergence and then cancellation during the jet\nevolution. DEM analyses showed that for most of the spires of the jets, the DEM\npeaked at around log T [K] = 6.2/6.3. In addition, we derived an emission\nmeasure and a lower limit of electron density at the location of the spire and\nthe footpoint. These results are in agreement with those obtained earlier by\nstudying individual active region jets. The observation of flux cancellation,\nthe association with HXR emission and emission of nonthermal type III radio\nbursts, suggest that the initiation and therefore, heating is taking place at\nthe base of the jet. This is also supported by the high temperature plasma\nrevealed by the DEM analysis in the jet footpoint. Our results provide\nsubstantial constraints for theoretical modeling of the jets and their\nthermodynamic nature.",

Using a wavelet-based\nanalyses of 17 occultations of the star gamma Crucis observed by the Visual and\nInfrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft, we are\nable to examine five density waves in the B ring. Two of these waves are\ngenerated by the Janus 2:1 and Mimas 5:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 96,427 km\nand 101,311 km from Saturn's center, respectively. Both of these waves can be\ndetected in individual occultation profiles, but the multi-profile wavelet\nanalysis reveals unexpected variations in the pattern speed of the Janus 2:1\nwave that might arise from the periodic changes in Janus' orbit. The other\nthree wave signatures are associated with the Janus 3:2, Enceladus 3:1 and\nPandora 3:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 115,959 km, 115,207 km and 108,546 km.\nThese waves are not visible in individual profiles, but structures with the\ncorrect pattern speeds can be detected in appropriately phase-corrected average\nwavelets. Estimates of the ring's surface mass density derived from these five\nwaves fall between 40 and 140 g/cm^2, even though the ring's optical depth in\nthese regions ranges from 1.5 to almost 5. This suggests that the total mass of\nthe B ring is most likely between one-third and two-thirds the mass of Saturn's\nmoon Mimas.",

A distribution of U-errors was obtained, at various times, in\na set of points covering a large region surrounding Earth. Here, the\npositioning errors associated to the simplifying assumption that photons move\nin Minkowski space-time (S-errors) are estimated and compared with the\nU-errors. Both errors have been calculated for the same points and times to\nmake comparisons possible. For a certain realistic modeling of the world line\nuncertainties, the estimated S-errors have proved to be smaller than the\nU-errors, which shows that the approach based on the assumption that the\nEarth's gravitational field produces negligible effects on photons may be used\nin a large region surrounding Earth. The applicability of this approach -which\nsimplifies numerical calculations- to positioning problems, and the usefulness\nof our S-error maps, are pointed out. A better approach, based on the\nassumption that photons move in the Schwarzschild space-time governed by an\nidealized Earth, is also analyzed. More accurate descriptions of photon\npropagation involving non symmetric space-time structures are not necessary for\nordinary positioning and spacecraft navigation around Earth.",

The\non-going Gaia mission is taken as a pilot case for our analysis, reporting on\nfresh literature and original optical photometry and astrometric results. The\nprobe has been located, along its projected nominal path, within 0.13 +/- 0.09\narcsec, or 0.9 +/- 0.6 km.

The apparent magnitude, R_c = 20.8 +/- 0.2, is much fainter than\noriginally expected. These features lead to suggest a lower limit for the Bond\nalbedo a = 0.11 +/- 0.05 and confirm that incident Sun light is strongly\nreddened by Gaia through its on-board MLI blankets covering the solar shield.\nRelying on the Gaia figures, we found that VLT-class telescopes could yet be\nable to probe distant spacecraft heading Mars, up to 30 million km away, while\na broader optical coverage of the forthcoming missions to Venus and Mars could\nbe envisaged, providing to deal with space vehicles of minimum effective area\nAeff >= 10^6 cm^2.

In this paper, we report our\nmultiwavelength observations of two groups of homologous jets. The first group\nwas observed by the EUVI aboard the behind STEREO spacecraft in 171 \u00c5 and\n304 \u00c5 on 2014 September 10, from a location where data from the SDO could\nnot observe. The jets (J1$-$J6) recurred for six times with intervals of 5$-$15\nminutes. They originated from the same primary CBP (BP1) and propagated in the\nnortheast direction along large-scale, closed coronal loops. Two of the jets\n(J3 and J6) produced sympathetic CBPs (BP2 and BP3) after reaching the remote\nfootpoints of the loops. The time delays between the peak times of BP1 and BP2\n(BP3) are 240$\\pm$75 s (300$\\pm75$ s). The jets were not coherent. Instead,\nthey were composed of bright and compact blobs. The sizes and apparent\nvelocities of the blobs are 4.5$-$9 Mm and 140$-$380 km/s, respectively. The\narrival times of the multiple blobs in the jets at the far-end of the loops\nindicate that the sympathetic CBPs are caused by jet flows rather than thermal\nconduction fronts. The second group was observed by the AIA aboard SDO in\nvarious wavelengths on 2010 August 3. Similar to the first group, the jets\noriginated from a short-lived bright point (BP) at the boundary of AR 11092 and\npropagated along a small-scale, closed loop before flowing into the active\nregion. Several tiny blobs with sizes of $\\sim$1.7 Mm and apparent velocity of\n~238 km/s were identified in the jets. We carried out the DEM inversions to\ninvestigate the temperatures of the blobs, finding that the blobs were\nmultithermal with average temperature of 1.8$-$3.1 MK.",

The ability to respond rapidly to the\npotentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the\nscientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.\nSimilar challenge arise in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using\nsensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems. Given the exponential growth\nof data rates, and the time-critical response, we need a fully automated and\nrobust approach. We describe the results obtained to date, and the possible\nfuture developments.",

It is shown that, on average, the spacecraft\ndescribing such a trajectory can exert a significantly larger force on the\nasteroid than e.g. a stationary gravity tractor, thereby reducing the time\nneeded to effect a desired velocity change for the asteroid. Furthermore, the\ncurrent method does not require canted thrusters on the spacecraft (unlike a\nstationary gravity tractor), markedly reducing the amount of fuel needed to\ncreate a given change in the asteroid velocity. In addition, the method allows\nfor the simultaneous use of several spacecraft, further strengthening the\noverall tugging effect on the asteroid, and distributing the thrust requirement\namong the spacecraft.",

The SEP event on 7 Nov 2013 was observed by both STEREO spacecraft,\nwhich were longitudinally separated by 68\u00b0 at that time. While STEREO A\nobserved the expected characteristics of an SEP event at a well-connected\nposition, STEREO B detected a very anisotropic bi-directional distribution of\nnear-relativistic electrons and was situated inside a magnetic-cloud-like\nstructure during the early phase of the event. We examine the source of the\nbi-directional SEP distribution at STEREO B. On the one hand this distribution\ncould be caused by a double injection into both loop legs of the MC. On the\nother hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the\nopposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron\nobservations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic\ncloud. We show that STEREO B was embedded in an MC-like structure ejected three\ndays earlier. We apply a GCS model to the coronagraph observations from three\nviewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud model to the in situ\nmeasurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC\nclose to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the\nelectrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field\nline winding inside the structure. The relative intensity and timing of the\nenergetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B\nstrongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP\ninjections in both loop legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring\nfarther away beyond the STEREO orbit. Observations by the Nancay\nRadioheliograph of two distinct radio sources during the SEP injection further\nsupport the above scenario.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The large intensity of greater than 10 GeV positrons which apparently come\nfrom sources outside the Earth-Sun system observed recently by many spacecraft\n(PAMELA, FERMI, AMS2) is still a mystery with broad implications. In our\nattempts to solve this mystery we have first tried to define reasonable limits\nto the positrons produced in our own galaxy by nuclear interactions of cosmic\nrays. This is best done by using the secondary B/C ratio produced by these same\ncosmic rays in order to define the amount of matter traversed by galactic\ncosmic ray nuclei. Using new values of the B/C ratio together with earlier\ncalculations of positron production by Moskalenko and Strong, 1998, we find\nthat at 10 GeV this galactic production is from 70% to almost 100% of the\npositrons observed by the above experiments. At 100 GeV these fractions are\nstill from 20 to 33% of the positrons observed. The resulting excess positron\nspectrum above this normal galactic background is found to have an exponent\n-2.75, possibly flattening at lower energies. If these positrons are coming to\nus from a uniform source distribution in and beyond the disk of the galaxy with\na source spectrum that is E-2.0, a spectral steepening caused by synchrotron\nand inverse Compton losses, which are largest near the galactic plane, will\nproduce a spectrum E-2.75 at the Earth. This is similar to the excess spectrum\nwe find. The excess positron spectrum E-2.75 that we obtain is also very\nsimilar to the positron spectrum produced by galactic protons in the Earths\natmosphere and in the spacecraft itself which also has a spectrum E-2.75. This\nresults in a background for all the above experiments. The assumption is that\nthis type of background is removed by the stringent criteria that are imposed\non each event. This calculation needs to be reconsidered before the\nimplications of these important positron results can be fully evaluated.",

Unlike the coronal mass ejection (CME) that accompanies it, the 2011\nJune prominence exhibits little deceleration from the Sun to 1 AU, as a\nconsequence moving upwards within the CME. This demonstrates that prominences\nare not necessarily tied to the CME's magnetic structure far from the Sun. A\nmathematical framework is developed for describing the degree of\nself-similarity for the prominence's expansion away from the Sun.

Despite these roll errors, the flight system and its\nmodified science data processing pipeline restores much of the photometric\nprecision of the primary mission while viewing a wide variety of targets, thus\nturning adversity into diversity. We define metrics for data compression and\npixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet\ntransit and stellar activity time scales; residual correlations in corrected\nlong cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from\noverfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data\ncompression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the\ncenter of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star\ncount as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the\nlimiting 6 hour photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as\nlow as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is\nachieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the\ndata are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up 15 days. At\ntime scales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive\ncalibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40% of that\nachieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis\nresulting from 1.5 yr of experience with this new mission concept, and\nquantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's\nalready high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.",

However, for higher energies\n($\\simeq 25$ MeV protons) within the range of multi-spacecraft measurements,\nthe longitudinal spread originating from transport due to gradient/curvature\ndrift reaches up to $\\simeq 10^\\circ- 20^\\circ$. This result highlights the\nrole of the perpendicular transport in the interpretation of interplanetary and\ninterstellar data.",

Thus, the expected perturbations $\\dot\\varpi,~\\dot\\Omega$ due to\nPX, for which we suggest the name Telisto in view of its remarkable distance,\non the Kronian apsidal and draconitic orbital motions are theoretically\ninvestigated to tentatively constrain the configuration space of Telisto/Planet\nNine itself.

As such, our results, despite being plausible and in agreement to a\nlarge extent with other constraints released in the literature, should be\nregarded as proof-of-principle investigations aimed to encourage more accurate\nanalyses in future. It turns out that the admissible region in its\nconfiguration space is moderately narrow as far as its position along its\norbit, reckoned by the true anomaly $f_\\textrm{X}$, is concerned, being\nconcentrated around approximately $130~\\textrm{deg}\\lesssim\nf_\\textrm{X}\\lesssim 240~\\textrm{deg}$. Telisto/Planet Nine is certainly far\nfrom its perihelion ($f_\\textrm{X}=0~\\textrm{deg}$), in agreement with other\nrecent studies. The future analysis of the data from the ongoing New Horizons\nmission might be helpful in further constraining the scenario considered here\nfor Telisto/Planet Nine.

The key to the mission's success is the\ndevelopment of high-performance capture media, and the major challenge is to\nsatisfy the mechanical requirements as a spacecraft payload while maximizing\nthe performance for intact capture. To this end, an ultralow-density (0.01 g\ncm$^{-3}$) soft aerogel was employed in combination with a relatively robust\n0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ aerogel. A procedure was also established for the mass\nproduction of double-layer aerogel tiles formed with a 0.01 g cm$^{-3}$ surface\nlayer and a 0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ open-topped, box-shaped base layer, and 60 aerogel\ntiles were manufactured.

Furthermore, periodic light\ncurves directly probe the rotational periods of ultra-cool objects.

We observed the binary system with\nHST/WFC3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. Using point spread\nfunction-based photometry, we reach a nearly photon-noise limited accuracy for\nboth the primary and the secondary. While the primary is consistent with a flat\nlight curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in the\ncombined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. The\namplitudes are 1.36% in the F125W and 0.78% in the F160W filters, respectively.\nBy fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of\n$10.7^{+1.2}_{-0.6}$ hours and similar phases in both bands. The J- and H-band\namplitude ratio of 2M1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that has\nidentical spectral type but different J-H color.

Kepler magnitudes (Kp) are shown to be accurate to\n~0.1 mag for the Kepler field, and the EPIC is typically complete to Kp~17\n(Kp~19 for campaigns covered by SDSS).

Our results show that stars\ntargeted by K2 are dominated by K-M dwarfs (~41% of all selected targets), F-G\ndwarfs (~36%) and K giants (~21%), consistent with key K2 science programs to\nsearch for transiting exoplanets and galactic archeology studies using\noscillating red giants. However, we find a significant variation of the\nfraction of cool dwarfs with galactic latitude, indicating a target selection\nbias due to interstellar reddening and the increased contamination by giant\nstars near the galactic plane. We discuss possible systematic errors in the\nderived stellar properties, and differences to published classifications for K2\nexoplanet host stars.

This method can determine the actual distance to the\nburst if it is local. We applied this method to constrain distances to a sample\nof 36 short duration GRBs detected by the Interplanetary Network (IPN) that\nshow observational properties that are expected from PBH evaporations. These\nbursts have minimum possible distances in the 10^13-10^18 cm (7-10^5 AU) range,\nconsistent with the expected PBH energetics and with a possible origin in the\nsolar neighborhood, although none of the bursts can be unambiguously\ndemonstrated to be local.

Here we present peculiarities of ULF waves generated by\ndifferent solar wind phenomenon: surface magnetopause instability,\nmagnetosphere cavity modes and solar wind dynamic pressure sudden impulses (SI)\npenetration into the magnetosphere. Permanent observations of ULF waves involve\nexistence of the permanent source and, as the previous studies showed, the\ncontributions to Pc4-Pc5 ULF wave power from the external sources are larger\nthan the contribution from internal magnetosphere sources. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) can generate on the magnetosphere flanks classical ULF\nresonant waves with spatially localized amplitude maximum. As observations show\nthe constraint satisfaction of KHI development is quite rare. SI in solar wind\ndynamic pressure generate ULF waves with different polarization and frequency\nclose to the frequency of the local field line resonance (FLR). Wide range of\ntemporal and amplitude characteristics of solar wind dynamics can generate\nmagnetosphere cavity modes and magnetosonic perturbations which penetrate\nthrough the magnetosphere and can couple with the local FLR modes. The observed\ndependence of ULF waves properties on their localization are well correspond to\nthese sources and their occurrence.",
