Data were\ntaken with the TUPI muon telescope, working at a high counting rate (up to 100\nKHz) and always pointing on the IMF lines (45 degrees of pitch angle). An\nanti-correlation among the arrival of keV protons (observed by EPAM detector\naboard the ACE spacecraft) and sudden depressions in the muon flux at sea level\nhave been observed. The phenomena is discussed in the context that they can be\nconsidered as mini-Forbush, caused by a shielding effect of the passage of a\ndisturbance (shock and plasma) and may be a signature of interplanetary\nmanifestations of coronal mass ejections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In addition to its long-term constancy, the Pioneer (spacecraft) anomaly\nappears to only exist for bodies whose mass is less than that of: planets,\nmoons, comets, and heavy asteroids of known mass. Assuming the observational\nevidence is reliable, and not the result of an unknown systematic effect, a\nviolation of the Weak Principle of Equivalence is implied. To propose an\nadditional force fails to satisfy this constraint. This paper presents a new\nhypothesis involving additional field energy in the form of: a finite number of\nlunar sourced constant amplitude (Lorentz invariant) wave-like undulations upon\nthe gravitational field. Although apparently a futile suggestion, the author's\nmodel overcomes concerns regarding wave dissipation, wave generation, and the\napparent constancy of the anomaly. A shortfall in motion arises because a tiny\nproportion of spacecraft kinetic energy is directed into a superposition of\nnon-translational longitudinal oscillatory components. The restriction of this\neffect to low mass bodies is also addressed. Additionally, the annual residual\nof the Pioneer anomaly may be attributed to a real 356 day Callisto-Titan wave\nresonance. This hypothesis may also be readily applied to other solar system\nanomalies including: the Earth flyby anomaly, an apparent absence of small\ncomets, an apparent paucity of smaller bodies in the Main Belt of asteroids,\nand residual doubts concerning the migrating planets hypothesis that addresses\nthe too rapid formation of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The acceleration of interstellar pick-up ions as well as solar wind species\nhas been observed at a multitude of interplanetary (IP) shocks by different\nspacecraft. The efficiency of injection of the pick-up ion component differs\nfrom that of the solar wind, and is expected to be strongly enhanced at highly\noblique and quasi-perpendicular shock events, in accord with inferences from\n{\\it in situ} observations. This paper explores theoretical modeling of the\nphase space distributions of accelerated ions obtained by the Ulysses mission\nfor the Day 292, 1991 shock associated with a corotating interaction region,\nencountered before Ulysses' fly-by of Jupiter. A Monte Carlo simulation is used\nto model the acceleration process, adapting a technique that has been\nsuccessfully tested on earlier IP shocks possessing minimal pick-up ion\npresence. Phase space distributions from the simulation technique for various\nlow mass ions are compared with SWICS and HI-SCALE data to deduce values of a\n``turbulence parameter'' that controls the efficiency of injection, and the\ndegree of cross-field diffusion. Acceptable fits are obtained for the $H^+$ and\n$He^+$ populations using standard prescriptions for the pick-up ion\ndistribution; $He^{++}$ spectral data was only fit well for scenarios very\nclose to the Bohm diffusion limit. It is also found that the simulation\nsuccessfully accounts for the observation of energetic protons farther upstream\nof the forward shock than lower energy pick-up protons, using the same\nturbulence parameter that is required to achieve reasonable spectral fits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The space-based gravitational-wave observatory LISA, a NASA-ESA mission to be\nlaunched after 2012, will achieve its optimal sensitivity using Time Delay\nInterferometry (TDI), a LISA-specific technique needed to cancel the otherwise\noverwhelming laser noise in the inter-spacecraft phase measurements. The TDI\nobservables of the Michelson and Sagnac types have been interpreted physically\nas the virtual measurements of a synthesized interferometer. In this paper, I\npresent Geometric TDI, a new and intuitive approach to extend this\ninterpretation to all TDI observables. Unlike the standard algebraic formalism,\nGeometric TDI provides a combinatorial algorithm to explore exhaustively the\nspace of second-generation TDI observables (i.e., those that cancel laser noise\nin LISA-like interferometers with time-dependent armlengths). Using this\nalgorithm, I survey the space of second-generation TDI observables of length\n(i.e., number of component phase measurements) up to 24, and I identify\nalternative, improved forms of the standard second-generation TDI observables.\nThe alternative forms have improved high-frequency gravitational-wave\nsensitivity in realistic noise conditions (because they have fewer nulls in the\ngravitational-wave and noise response functions), and are less susceptible to\ninstrumental gaps and glitches (because their component phase measurements span\nshorter time periods).",

During\nthe 141 years to 2000, the precisions of laboratory and space experiments, and\nastrophysical and cosmological observations on relativistic gravity have been\nimproved by 3 orders of magnitude. In 1999, we envisaged a 3-6 order\nimprovement in the next 30 years in all directions of tests of relativistic\ngravity. In 2000, the interferometric gravitational wave detectors began their\nruns to accumulate data. In 2003, the measurement of relativistic Shapiro\ntime-delay of the Cassini spacecraft determined the relativistic-gravity\nparameter gamma&#947; with a 1.5-order improvement. In October 2004, Ciufolini\nand Pavlis reported a measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect on the LAGEOS\nand LAGEOS2 satellites to 10 percent of the value predicted by general\nrelativity. In April 2004, Gravity Probe B was launched and has been\naccumulating science data for more than 170 days now. MICROSCOPE is on its way\nfor a 2007 launch to test Galileo equivalence principle to 10-15. STEP\n(Satellite Test of Equivalence Principle), and ASTROD (Astrodynamical Space\nTest of Relativity using Optical Devices) are in the good planning stage.\nVarious astrophysical tests and cosmological tests of relativistic gravity will\nreach precision and ultra-precision stages. Clock tests and atomic\ninterferometry tests of relativistic gravity will reach an ever-increasing\nprecision. These will give revived interest and development both in\nexperimental and theoretical aspects of gravity, and may lead to answers to\nsome profound questions of gravity and the cosmos.",

Hence the effect,\ncommonly dubbed the Pioneer anomaly, is attracting considerable attention.\nUnfortunately, no other space mission has reached the long-term navigation\naccuracy to yield an independent test of the effect. To fill this gap we\ndiscuss strategies for an experimental verification of the anomaly via an\nupcoming space mission. Emphasis is put on two plausible scenarios:\nnondedicated concepts employing either a planetary exploration mission to the\nouter Solar System or a piggybacked micro-spacecraft to be launched from a\nmother spacecraft travelling to Saturn or Jupiter. The study analyses the\nimpact of a Pioneer anomaly test on the system and trajectory design for these\ntwo paradigms. It is found that both paradigms are capable of verifying the\nPioneer anomaly and determine its magnitude at 10% level. Moreover the concepts\ncan discriminate between the most plausible classes of models of the anomaly, a\ncentral force, a blueshift of the radio signal and a drag-like force. The\nnecessary adaptions of the system and mission design do not impair the\nplanetary exploration goals of the missions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The giant outburst from SGR 1806-20 was observed on 2004 December 27 by many\nspacecraft. This extremely rare event exhibits a striking similarity to the two\ngiant outbursts thus far observed, on 1979 March 5 from SGR 0526-66 and 1998\nAugust 27 from SGR 1900+14. All the three outbursts start with a short giant\nradiation pulse followed by a weaker tail. The tail pulsates with the period of\nneutron star rotation of $\\sim$5--8 s, to decay finally in a few minutes. The\nenormous intensity of the initial pulse proved to be far above the saturation\nlevel of the gamma-ray detectors, with the result that the most valuable data\non the time structure and energy spectrum of the pulse is lost. At the time of\nthe December 27 outburst, a Russian spacecraft Coronas-F with a $\\gamma$-ray\nspectrometer aboard was occulted by the Earth and could not see the outburst.\nIt succeeded, however, in observing a weak reflected signal due to the\n$\\gamma$-rays Compton scattered by the Moon. This has been the first\nobservation of a cosmic gamma-ray flare reflected from a celestial body. Here\nwe report, that the detection of a weakened back-scattered initial pulse\ncombined with direct observations by the Konus $\\gamma$-ray spectrometer on the\nWind spacecraft permitted us to reliably reconstruct the intensity, time\nhistory, and energy spectra of the outburst.",

The accuracies of their orbit reconstruction were limited,\nhowever, by a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift that can be interpreted\nas an acceleration of (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^{-8} cm/s^2 directed toward the Sun.\nWe investigate the possibility that this anomaly could be due to a drag on the\nspacecraft from their passing through the interplanetary medium. Although this\nmechanism is an appealing one, the existing Pioneer radiometric data would\nrequire an unexpectedly high mass density of interplanetary dust for this\nmechanism to work. Further, the magnitude of the density would have to be\nnearly constant at distances ~ 20-70 AU. Therefore, it appears that such an\nexplanation is very unlikely, if not ruled out. Despite this, the measured\nfrequency drift by itself places a directly-measured, model-independent limit\nof \\lessim 3 x 10^{-19} g/cm^3 on the mass density of interplanetary dust in\nthe outer(~20-70 AU) solar system. Lower experimental limits can be placed if\none presumes a model that varies with distance. An example is the limit \\lessim\n6 x 10^{-20} g/cm^3 obtained for the model with an axially-symmetric density\ndistribution that falls off as the inverse of the distance. We emphasize that\nthe limits obtained are experimentally-measured, in situ limits.

This takes the full\nwavelength ranges from both the NIS channels (308-381 Angtr. and 513-633\nAngst.) with the 2 arcsec by 240 arcsec slit, which is the narrowest slit\navailable, yielding the best spectral resolution. In this work we contrast the\nDEM from subregions of 2 by 80 arcsec$^2$ with that obtained from the mean\nspectrum of the whole raster (20 by 240 arcsec$^2$). We find that the DEM\nmaintains essentially the same shape in the subregions, differing by a constant\nfactor between 0.5 and 2 from the mean DEM, except in areas were the electron\ndensity is below $2 \\times 10^7$ cm$^{-3}$ and downflow velocities of 50 km/s\nare found in the transition region. Such areas are likely to contain plasma\ndeparting from ionisation equilibrium, violating the basic assumptions\nunderlying the DEM method. The comparison between lines of Li-like and Be-like\nions may provide further evidence of departure from ionisation equilibrium. We\nfind also that line intensities tend to be lower where velocities of the order\nof 30 km/s or higher are measured in transition region lines. The DEM analysis\nis also exploited to improve the line identification performed by Brooks et al\n(1999) and to investigate possible elemental abundance variations from region\nto region. We find that the plasma has composition close to photospheric in all\nthe subregions examined.",

The\nspectral estimators used for this purpose are affected by a frequency dependent\nbias. The variances of the wavelet coefficients, however, match the power-law\nshaped spectra, which makes the wavelet estimator essentially unbiased. These\nscaling characteristics of the magnetic field data appear to be essentially\nnon-steady and intermittent. The scaling properties of bursty bulk flow (BBF)\nand non-BBF associated magnetic fluctuations are analysed with the aim of\nunderstanding processes of energy transfer between scales. Small-scale ($\\sim\n0.08-0.3$ s) magnetic fluctuations having the same scaling index $\\alpha \\sim\n2.6$ as the large-scale ($\\sim 0.7-5$ s) magnetic fluctuations occur during\nBBF-associated periods. During non-BBF associated periods the energy transfer\nto small scales is absent, and the large-scale scaling index $\\alpha \\sim 1.7$\nis closer to Kraichnan or Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scalings. The anisotropy\ncharacteristics of magnetic fluctuations show both scale-dependent and\nscale-independent behavior. The former can be partly explained in terms of the\nGoldreich-Sridhar model of MHD turbulence, which leads to the picture of\nAlfv\u00e9nic turbulence parallel and of eddy turbulence perpendicular to the\nmean magnetic field direction. Nonetheless, other physical mechanisms, such as\ntransverse magnetic structures, velocity shears, or boundary effects can\ncontribute to the anisotropy characteristics of plasma sheet turbulence. The\nscale-independent features are related to anisotropy characteristics which\noccur during a period of magnetic reconnection and fast tailward flow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Space-borne interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, sensitive in the\nlow-frequency (mHz) band, will fly in the next decade. In these detectors, the\nspacecraft-to-spacecraft light-travel times will necessarily be unequal and\ntime-varying, and (because of aberration) will have different values on up- and\ndown-links. In such unequal-armlength interferometers, laser phase noise will\nbe canceled by taking linear combinations of the laser-phase observables\nmeasured between pairs of spacecraft, appropriately time-shifted by the light\npropagation times along the corresponding arms. This procedure, known as\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI), requires an accurate knowledge of the\nlight-time delays as functions of time. Here we propose a high-accuracy\ntechnique to estimate these time delays and study its use in the context of the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We refer to this ranging\ntechnique, which relies on the TDI combinations themselves, as Time-Delay\nInterferometric Ranging (TDIR). For every TDI combination, we show that, by\nminimizing the rms power in that combination (averaged over integration times\n$\\sim 10^4$ s) with respect to the time-delay parameters, we obtain estimates\nof the time delays accurate enough to cancel laser noise to a level well below\nthe secondary noises. Thus TDIR allows the implementation of TDI without the\nuse of dedicated inter-spacecraft ranging systems, with a potential\nsimplification of the LISA design. In this paper we define the TDIR procedure\nformally, and we characterize its expected performance via simulations with the\n\\textit{Synthetic LISA} software package.",

Among HST's list of\nsuccessful observations of the first such system, HD 209458, are (1) the first\ndetection of the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, (2) the determination that\ngas is escaping from the planet, and (3) a search for Earth-sized satellites\nand circumplanetary rings. Numerous wide-field, ground-based transit surveys\nare poised to uncover a gaggle of new worlds for which HST may undertake\nsimilar studies, such as the newly-discovered planet TrES-1. With regard to the\nfuture of Hubble, it must be noted that it is the only observatory in existence\ncapable of confirming transits of Earth-like planets that may be detected by\nNASA's Kepler mission.

The drift is a blue-shift, uniformly changing with rate a_t =\n(2.92 +/- 0.44) x 10^(-18) s/s^2. It can also be interpreted as a constant\nacceleration of a_P = (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^(-8) cm/s^2 directed towards the\nSun. Although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect,\nnone has been found. As a result, the nature of this anomaly has become of\ngrowing interest. Here we discuss the details of our recent investigation\nfocusing on the effects both external to and internal to the spacecraft, as\nwell as those due to modeling and computational techniques. We review some of\nthe mechanisms proposed to explain the anomaly and show their inability to\naccount for the observed behavior of the anomaly. We also present lessons\nlearned from this investigation for a potential deep-space experiment that will\nreveal the origin of the discovered anomaly and also will characterize its\nproperties with an accuracy of at least two orders of magnitude below the\nanomaly's size.

This mission uses laser interferometry between two\nmicro-spacecraft whose lines of sight pass close by the Sun to accurately\nmeasure deflection of light in the solar gravity. The key element of the\nexperimental design is a redundant geometry optical truss provided by a\nlong-baseline (100 m) multi-channel stellar optical interferometer placed on\nthe International Space Station (ISS). The spatial interferometer is used for\nmeasuring the angles between the two spacecraft and for orbit determination\npurposes. The geometric redundancy enables LATOR to measure the departure from\nEuclidean geometry caused by the solar gravity field to a very high accuracy.\nSuch a design enables LATOR to improve the value of the parameterized\npost-Newtonian (PPN) parameter $\\gamma$ to unprecedented levels of accuracy of\n1 part in 10$^{8}$; the misison will also measure effects of the next\npost-Newtonian order ($\\propto G^2$) of light deflection resulting from\ngravity's intrinsic non-linearity. The solar quadrupole moment parameter,\n$J_2$, will be measured with high precision, as well as a variety of other\nrelativistic effects including Lense-Thirring precession. LATOR will lead to\nvery robust advances in the tests of Fundamental physics: this mission could\ndiscover a violation or extension of general relativity, or reveal the presence\nof an additional long range interaction in the physical law.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The sensitivity and versatility of SKA will provide microarcsec astrometric\nprecision and high quality milliarcsec-resolution images by simultaneously\ndetecting calibrator sources near the target source. To reach these goals, we\nsuggest that the long-baseline component of SKA contains at least 25% of the\ntotal collecting area in a region between 1000 to 5000 km from the core SKA. We\nalso suggest a minimum of 60 elements in the long-baseline component of SKA to\nprovide the necessary (u-v) coverage. For simultaneous all-sky observations,\nwhich provide absolute astrometric and geodetic parameters, we suggest using\nten independent subarrays each composed of at least six long-baseline elements\ncorrelated with the core SKA. We discuss many anticipated SKA long-baseline\nastrometric experiments: determination of distance, proper motion and orbital\nmotion of thousands of stellar objects; planetary motion detections; mass\ndetermination of degenerate stars using their kinetics; calibration of the\nuniversal distance scale from 10 pc to 10 Mpc; the core and inner-jet\ninteractions of AGN. With an increase by a factor of 10 in absolute astrometric\naccuracy using simultaneous all sky observations, the fundamental quasar\nreference frame can be defined to <10 microarcsec and tied to the solar-system\ndynamic frame to this accuracy. Parameters associated with the earth rotation\nand orientation, nutation, and geophysical parameters, can be accurately\nmonitored. Tests of fundamental physics include: solar and Jovian deflection\nexperiments, the sky frame accuracy needed to interpret the gravity\nwave/pulsar-timing experiment, accurate monitoring of spacecraft orbits which\nimpacts solar system dynamics.",

Strong non-Gaussianity of solar wind fluctuations applies for short\ntime-lag spacecraft observations, corresponding to small-scale spatial\nseparations, whereas for large scales the differences turn into a Gaussian\nnormal distribution. These characteristics were hitherto described in the\ncontext of the log-normal, the Castaing distribution or the shell model. On the\nother hand, a possible explanation for nonlocality in turbulence is offered\nwithin the context of nonextensive entropy generalization by a recently\nintroduced bi-kappa distribution, generating through a convolution of a\nnegative-kappa core and positive-kappa halo pronounced non-Gaussian structures.\nThe PDFs of solar wind scalar field differences are computed from WIND and ACE\ndata for different time lags and compared with the characteristics of the\ntheoretical bi-kappa functional, well representing the overall scale dependence\nof the spatial solar wind intermittency. The observed PDF characteristics for\nincreased spatial scales are manifest in the theoretical distribution\nfunctional by enhancing the only tuning parameter $\\kappa$, measuring the\ndegree of nonextensivity where the large-scale Gaussian is approached for\n$\\kappa \\to \\infty$. The nonextensive approach assures for experimental studies\nof solar wind intermittency independence from influence of a priori model\nassumptions. It is argued that the intermittency of the turbulent fluctuations\nshould be related physically to the nonextensive character of the\ninterplanetary medium counting for nonlocal interactions via the entropy\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in December 1995\nwith a suite of instruments designed to answer long-standing questions about\nthe Sun's internal structure, its extensive outer atmosphere, and the solar\nwind. This paper reviews the new understanding of the physical processes\nresponsible for the solar wind that have come from the past 8 years of SOHO\nobservations, analysis, and theoretical work. For example, the UVCS instrument\non SOHO has revealed the acceleration region of the fast solar wind to be far\nfrom simple thermal equilibrium. Evidence for preferential acceleration of\nions, 100 million K ion temperatures, and marked departures from Maxwellian\nvelocity distributions all point to specific types of collisionless heating\nprocesses. The slow solar wind, typically associated with bright helmet\nstreamers, has been found to share some of the nonthermal characteristics of\nthe fast wind. Abundance measurements from spectroscopy and visible-light\ncoronagraphic movies from LASCO have led to a better census of the plasma\ncomponents making up the slow wind. The origins of the solar wind in the\nphotosphere and chromosphere have been better elucidated with disk spectroscopy\nfrom the SUMER and CDS instruments. Finally, the impact of the solar wind on\nspacecraft systems, ground-based technology, and astronauts has been greatly\naided by having continuous solar observations at the Earth-Sun L1 point, and\nSOHO has set a strong precedent for future studies of space weather.",

For any given burst\nobserved by BATSE and one other distant spacecraft, arrival time analysis (or\n``triangulation'') results in an annulus of possible arrival directions whose\nhalf-width varies between 14 arcseconds and 5.6 degrees, depending on the\nintensity, time history, and arrival direction of the burst, as well as the\ndistance between the spacecraft. This annulus generally intersects the BATSE\nerror circle, resulting in a reduction of the area of up to a factor of ~650.\nWhen three widely separated spacecraft observed a burst, the result is an error\nbox whose area is as much as 30000 times smaller than that of the BATSE error\ncircle.\nBecause the IPN instruments are considerably less sensitive than BATSE, they\ngenerally did not detect the weakest untriggered bursts, but did detect the\nmore intense ones which failed to trigger BATSE when the trigger was disabled.\nIn a few cases, we have been able to identify the probable origin of bursts as\nsoft gamma repeaters. The vast majority of the IPN-detected events, however,\nare GRBs, and the confirmation of them validates many of the procedures\nutilized to detect BATSE untriggered bursts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  LISA is an array of three spacecraft flying in an approximately equilateral\ntriangle configuration, which will be used as a low-frequency detector of\ngravitational waves. Recently a technique has been proposed for suppressing the\nphase noise of the onboard lasers by locking them to the LISA arms. In this\npaper we show that the delay-induced effects substantially modify the\nperformance of this technique, making it different from the conventional\nlocking of lasers to optical resonators. We analyze these delay-induced effects\nin both transient and steady-state regimes and discuss their implications for\nthe implementation of this technique on LISA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present detailed numerical simulations of a laser phase stabilization\nscheme for LISA, where both lasers emitting along one arm are locked to each\nother. Including the standard secondary noises and spacecraft motions that\napproximately mimic LISA's orbit, we verify that very stable laser phases can\nbe obtained, and that time delay interferometry can be used to remove the laser\nphase noise from measurements of gravitational wave strains. Most importantly,\nwe show that this locking scheme can provide significant simplifications over\nLISA's baseline design in the implementation of time delay interferometry.",
