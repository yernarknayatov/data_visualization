The current work presents a\nnew way to sense the environment using the channel equalization block of\nexisting communication systems. We have named this system CommSense. In the\ncurrent paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the system using Global System\nfor Mobile Communications (GSM) signals. The implementation has been done using\nopen-source Software Defined Radio (SDR) environment. In the preliminary\nresults obtained in our work we show that it is possible to distinguish\nenvironmental changes using the proposed system. The major advantage of the\nsystem is that it is inexpensive as channel estimation is an inherent block in\nany communication system and hence the added cost to make it work as an\nenvironment sensor is minimal. The major challenge, on which we are continuing\nour work, is how to characterize the features in the environmental changes.\nThis is an acute challenge given the fact that the bandwidth available is\nnarrow and the system is inherently a forward looking radar. However the\ninitial results, as shown in this paper, are encouraging and we intend to use\nan application specific instrumentation (ASIN) scheme to distinguish the\nenvironmental changes.",

Most existing approaches for this problem neither preserve the\nnorm of quaternions nor avoid errors accumulated in the sense of long term\ntime. We present symplectic geometric algorithms to deal with the quaternion\nkinematical differential equation by modeling its time-invariant and\ntime-varying versions with Hamiltonian systems by adopting a three-step\nstrategy. Firstly, a generalized Euler's formula for the autonomous quaternion\nkinematical differential equation are proved and used to construct symplectic\nsingle-step transition operators via the centered implicit Euler scheme for\nautonomous Hamiltonian system. Secondly, the symplecitiy, orthogonality and\ninvertibility of the symplectic transition operators are proved rigorously.\nFinally, the main results obtained are generalized to design symplectic\ngeometric algorithm for the time-varying quaternion kinematical differential\nequation which is a non-autonomous and nonlinear Hamiltonian system\nessentially. Our novel algorithms have simple algorithmic structures and low\ntime complexity of computation, which are easy to be implemented with real-time\ntechniques. The correctness and efficiencies of the proposed algorithms are\nverified and validated via numerical simulations.",

The first critical tests for future air-breathing\nmagneto-plasma propulsion systems have been successfully completed. In this\nregard, it is also the first time that a pinching dense plasma focus discharge\ncould be ignited at one atmosphere and driven in pulse mode using very fast,\nnanosecond electrostatic excitations to induce self-organized plasma channels\nfor ignition of the propulsive main discharge. Depending on the capacitor\nvoltage (200-600 V) the energy input at one atmosphere varies from 52-320\nJ/pulse corresponding to impulse bits from 1.2-8.0 mNs. Such a new pulsed\nplasma propulsion system driven with one thousand pulses per second would\nalready have thrust-to-area ratios (50-150 kN/m2) of modern jet engines. An\narray of thrusters could enable future aircrafts and airships to start from\nground and reach altitudes up to 50km and beyond. The needed high power could\nbe provided by future compact plasma fusion reactors already in development by\naerospace companies. The magneto-plasma compressor itself was originally\ndeveloped by Russian scientists as plasma fusion device and was later\nminiaturized for supersonic flow control applications.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For near-Sun missions, the spacecraft approaches very close to the Sun and\nspace environmental effects become relevant. Strong restrictions on how much\nclose it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials\ncan stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and\nfunctionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given\nmission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The\ntemperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:\nreflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is\nconsidered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are\nconstant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the\ntemperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the\naerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on\nthe heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical\nproperties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly\nproportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as\n$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the\nsame temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,\neventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun\nwithout compromising its activities. We focused on metals used for aerospace\nstructures (Al, Ti), however our analysis can be extended to all kinds of\ncomposite materials, once their optical properties - in particular emissivity -\nare defined.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Avionics networks rely on a set of stringent reliability and safety\nrequirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired\ntechnology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology\nsimplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can\nbe safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network,\nand the fact that it is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node\ninto the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently\nunder development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in\nthe complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction\nin the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the\ncapacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts\nsuch as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing\nthese benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are\nat minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper,\nwe propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated\nsecurity and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main\nobjectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance\nthat all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their\ninternal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to\nestablish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to\nprovide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for\nboth the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a\ncold and/or warm restart of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and\nperformance measurements are presented based on this implementation. In\naddition, we formally verify our proposed protocol using CasperFDR.",

It is found that the standard presuppositions of\npeople like Benofy and Quay (BQ) following Joseph Fourier do not obtain for at\nleast a certain specified regime of intermolecular potential parameters related\nto harmonic (quadratic) potentials for nearest neighbor interactions. For these\nharmonic potentials, it appears from the simulation results that steady state\nsolutions exist utilizing non-synthetic thermostats that couple not just the\ntwo particles at the extreme ends of the lattice chain, but to a control volume\nof $N$ particles located at either ends of the chain that does not accord with\nthe unique analytical solutions that obtains for single particle thermostatting\nat the ends of the lattice with a different thermostatting algorithm that\nutilizes coupling coefficients. If the method used here is considered a more\n\"realistic\" or feasible model of the physical reality, then a re-evaluation of\nsome aspects of the standard theoretical methodology is warranted since the\nstandard model solution profile does not accord with the simulation temperature\nprofile determined here for this related model. We also note that the\nsinusoidal temperature profile generated suggests that thermal integrated\ncircuits with several thermal P-N junctions may be constructed, opening a way\nto create more complex thermal transistor circuits.

A key requirement of such systems is the need to provide\npredictable real-time performance: the timing correctness of the system should\nbe analyzable at design time with a quantitative metric and guaranteed at\nruntime with high assurance. This requirement of predictability is particularly\nimportant for safety-critical domains such as automobiles, aerospace, defense,\nmanufacturing and medical devices.\nThe work in this dissertation focuses on the challenges arising from the use\nof modern multi-core platforms in CPS. Even as of today, multi-core platforms\nare rarely used in safety-critical applications primarily due to the temporal\ninterference caused by contention on various resources shared among processor\ncores, such as caches, memory buses, and I/O devices. Such interference is hard\nto predict and can significantly increase task execution time, e.g., up to 12x\non commodity quad-core platforms. To address the problem of ensuring timing\npredictability on multi-core platforms, we develop novel analytical and systems\ntechniques in this dissertation. Our proposed techniques theoretically bound\ntemporal interference that tasks may suffer from when accessing shared\nresources. Our techniques also involve software primitives and algorithms for\nreal-time operating systems and hypervisors, which significantly reduce the\ndegree of the temporal interference. Specifically, we tackle the issues of\ncache and memory contention, locking and synchronization, interrupt handling,\nand access control for computational accelerators such as GPGPUs, all of which\nare crucial to achieving predictable real-time performance on a modern\nmulti-core platform.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper extends the capabilities of the harmonic potential field (HPF)\napproach to planning. The extension covers the situation where the workspace of\na robot cannot be segmented into geometrical subregions where each region has\nan attribute of its own. The suggested approach uses a task-centered,\nprobabilistic descriptor of the workspace as an input to the planner. This\ndescriptor is processed, along with a goal point, to yield the navigation\npolicy needed to steer the agent from any point in its workspace to the target.\nThe approach is easily adaptable to planning in a cluttered environment\ncontaining a vector drift field. The extension of the HPF approach is based on\nthe physical analogy with an electric current flowing in a nonhomogeneous\nconducting medium. The resulting potential field is known as the gamma-harmonic\npotential (GHPF). Proofs of the ability of the modified approach to avoid\nzero-probability (definite threat) regions and to converge to the goal are\nprovided. The capabilities of the planer are demonstrated using simulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Dependability is an umbrella concept that subsumes many key properties about\na system, including reliability, maintainability, safety, availability,\nconfidentiality, and integrity. Various dependability modeling techniques have\nbeen developed to effectively capture the failure characteristics of systems\nover time. Traditionally, dependability models are analyzed using\npaper-and-pencil proof methods and computer based simulation tools but their\nresults cannot be trusted due to their inherent inaccuracy limitations. The\nrecent developments in probabilistic analysis support using formal methods have\nenabled the possibility of accurate and rigorous dependability analysis. Thus,\nthe usage of formal methods for dependability analysis is widely advocated for\nsafety-critical domains, such as transportation, aerospace and health. Given\nthe complementary strengths of mainstream formal methods, like theorem proving\nand model checking, and the variety of dependability models judging the most\nsuitable formal technique for a given dependability model is not a\nstraightforward task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of\nexisting formal dependability analysis techniques along with their pros and\ncons for handling a particular dependability model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Target parameter estimation performance is investigated for a radar employing\na set of widely separated transmitting and receiving antenna arrays. Cases with\nmultiple extended targets are considered under two signal model assumptions:\nstochastic and deterministic. The general expressions for the corresponding\nCramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the asymptotic properties of the\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) estimator are derived for a radar with $M_t$ arrays of\n$L_t$ transmitting elements and $M_r$ arrays of $L_r$ receiving elements for\nboth types of signal models.\nIt is shown that for an infinitely large product $M_tM_r$, and a finite\n$L_r$, the ML estimator is consistent and efficient under the stochastic model,\nwhile the deterministic model requires $M_tM_r$ to be finite and $L_r$ to be\ninfinitely large in order to guarantee consistency and efficiency.\nMonte Carlo simulations further investigate the estimation performance of the\nproposed radar configuration in practical scenarios with finite $M_tM_r$ and\n$L_r$, and a fixed total number of available receiving antenna elements, $M_r\nL_r$. The numerical results demonstrate that grouping receiving elements into\nproperly sized arrays reduces the mean squared error (MSE) and decreases the\nthreshold SNR. In the numerical examples considered, the preferred\nconfigurations employ $M_t M_r > 1$. In fact, when $M_t M_r$ becomes too small,\ndue to the loss of the geometric gain, the estimation performance becomes\nstrongly dependent on the particular scenario and can degrade significantly,\nwhile the CRLB may become a poor prediction of the MSE even for high SNR. This\nsuggests it may be advantageous to employ approaches where neither $M_tM_r$ nor\n$L_r$ are too small.",

With this set-up, clear return signals have been received from\nseveral orbital objects equipped with retroreflectors.

Detection of the oil spill is performed using\nchange detection algorithms between imagery acquired at different times. The\nspecific algorithms used are the correlation coefficient change statistic and\nthe intensity ratio change statistic algorithms. Therefore these algorithms and\nthe probabilistic selection of the threshold criteria is reviewed and\ndiscussed. A recently offered change detection method which depends on the idea\nof generating two different final change maps of two images in a sequence, is\nused. First final change map is obtained by cumulatively adding the sequences\nof change maps in such a manner that common change areas are excluded and\nuncommon change areas are included. The second final change map is obtained by\ncomparing the first and the last images in the temporal sequence. This method\nrequires at least three images to be employed and can be generalized to longer\ntemporal image sequences. The purpose of this approach is to provide a double\ncheck mechanism to the conventional approach and thus to reduce the probability\nof false alarm and enhance the change detection. The algorithms mentioned are\napplied to a 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill imagery together with the method\ndescribed. It is shown that intensity ratio change statistic is a better tool\nfor identification of the changes due to the oil spill compared to the\ncorrelation coefficient change statistic.

Most previously\nproposed algorithms for bias estimation rely on local measurements in\ncentralized systems or tracks in distributed systems, along with additional\ninformation like covariances, filter gains or targets of opportunity. In\naddition, it is generally assumed that such data are made available to the\nfusion center at every sampling time. In practical distributed multisensor\ntracking systems, where each platform sends local tracks to the fusion center,\nonly state estimates and, perhaps, their covariances are sent to the fusion\ncenter at non-consecutive sampling instants or scans. That is, not all the\ninformation required for exact bias estimation at the fusion center is\navailable in practical distributed tracking systems. In this paper, a new\nalgorithm that is capable of accurately estimating the biases even in the\nabsence of filter gain information from local platforms is proposed for\ndistributed tracking systems with intermittent track transmission. Through the\ncalculation of the Posterior Cram\u00e9r--Rao lower bound and various simulation\nresults, it is shown that the performance of the new algorithm, which uses the\ntracklet idea and does not require track transmission at every sampling time or\nexchange of filter gains, can approach the performance of the exact bias\nestimation algorithm that requires local filter gains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Optimization of large structures of multiple components is essential to many\nindustries for minimizing mass, especially the design of aerospace vehicles.\nOptimizing a single primary load member independently of all other primary\nstructures is an incomplete process, due to the redistribution of internal\nloads, as the stiffness distribution changes. That is, optimizing a component\nchanges joint loads, which then calls for a new optimization - changing\ninternal loads changes the optimum. This is particularly evident under buckling\n(stability) constraints. The goal is to develop a finite element-based\noptimization approach which can be used to optimize each component of a large,\nprimary structure assembly. The optimization objective function will be to\nminimize mass for the system, and the constraints will be both stress\nconstraints as well as buckling constraints. The research aims to improve both\nthe solution and practical usability of these models. The system of interest is\na spacecraft fuselage, of which the member components are panels throughout the\nstructure. We present analyses of several main optimization methods, and define\na new algorithm to solve this problem, eigenOpt.",

CALET has been designed to achieve a large\nproton rejection capability (>10$^5$) with a fine grained imaging calorimeter\n(IMC) followed by a total absorption calorimeter (TASC), for a total thickness\nof 30 X$_{0}$ and 1.3 proton interaction length. With an excellent energy\nresolution and a lower background contamination with respect to previous\nexperiments, CALET will search for possible spectral signatures of dark matter\nwith both electrons and gamma rays. CALET will also measure the high energy\nspectra and relative abundance of cosmic nuclei from proton to iron and detect\ntrans-iron elements up to Z$\\sim$40. The charge identification of individual\nnuclear species is performed by a dedicated module (CHD) and by multiple dE/dx\nmeasurements in the IMC. With a large exposure and high energy resolution,\nCALET will be able to verify and complement the observations of CREAM, PAMELA\nand AMS-02 on a possible deviation from a pure power-law of proton and He\nspectra in the few hundred GeV region and to extend the study to the multi-TeV\nregion. CALET will also contribute to clarify the present experimental picture\non the energy dependence of the boron/carbon ratio, below and above 1 TeV/n,\nthereby providing valuable information on cosmic-ray propagation in the galaxy.\nGamma-ray transients will be studied with a dedicated Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\n(GBM).",
