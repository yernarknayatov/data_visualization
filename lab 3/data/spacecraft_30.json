    "abstract": "Abstract:  A leading explanation for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays is acceleration\nat high-Mach number shock waves in the collisionless plasma surrounding young\nsupernova remnants. Evidence for this is provided by multi-wavelength\nnon-thermal emission thought to be associated with ultrarelativistic electrons\nat these shocks. However, the dependence of the electron acceleration process\non the orientation of the upstream magnetic field with respect to the local\nnormal to the shock front (quasi-parallel/quasi-perpendicular) is debated.\nCassini spacecraft observations at Saturn's bow shock has revealed examples of\nelectron acceleration under quasi-perpendicular conditions, and the first in\nsitu evidence of electron acceleration at a quasi-parallel shock. Here we use\nCassini data to make the first comparison between energy spectra of locally\naccelerated electrons under these differing upstream magnetic field regimes. We\npresent data taken during a quasi-perpendicular shock crossing on 2008 March 8\nand during a quasi-parallel shock crossing on 2007 February 3, highlighting\nthat both were associated with electron acceleration to at least MeV energies.\nThe magnetic signature of the quasi-perpendicular crossing has a relatively\nsharp upstream-downstream transition, and energetic electrons were detected\nclose to the transition and immediately downstream. The magnetic transition at\nthe quasi-parallel crossing is less clear, energetic electrons were encountered\nupstream and downstream, and the electron energy spectrum is harder above ~100\nkeV. We discuss whether the acceleration is consistent with diffusive shock\nacceleration theory in each case, and suggest that the quasi-parallel spectral\nbreak is due to an energy-dependent interaction between the electrons and\nshort, large-amplitude magnetic structures.",

Using a technique called pulsar timing,\nthe exact measurement of pulse arrival times allows a number of applications,\nranging from testing theories of gravity to detecting gravitational waves. Also\nan external reference system suitable for autonomous space navigation can be\ndefined by pulsars, using them as natural navigation beacons, not unlike the\nuse of GPS satellites for navigation on Earth. By comparing pulse arrival times\nmeasured on-board a spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at a reference\nlocation (e.g. the solar system barycenter), the spacecraft position can be\ndetermined autonomously and with high accuracy everywhere in the solar system\nand beyond. We describe the unique properties of pulsars that suggest that such\na navigation system will certainly have its application in future astronautics.\nWe also describe the on-going experiments to use the clock-like nature of\npulsars to \"construct\" a galactic-sized gravitational wave detector for\nlow-frequency (f_GW ~1E-9 - 1E-7 Hz) gravitational waves.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We present a summary of the campaign of remote observations that supported\nthe European Space Agency's Rosetta mission. Telescopes across the globe (and\nin space) followed comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from before Rosetta's\narrival until nearly the end of mission in September 2016. These provided\nessential data for mission planning, large-scale context information for the\ncoma and tails beyond the spacecraft, and a way to directly compare 67P with\nother comets. The observations revealed 67P to be a relatively `well behaved'\ncomet, typical of Jupiter family comets and with activity patterns that repeat\nfrom orbit-to-orbit. Comparison between this large collection of telescopic\nobservations and the in situ results from Rosetta will allow us to better\nunderstand comet coma chemistry and structure. This work is just beginning as\nthe mission ends -- in this paper we present a summary of the ground-based\nobservations and early results, and point to many questions that will be\naddressed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Context: Photospheric flows create a network of often mixed-polarity magnetic\nfield in the quiet Sun, where small-scale eruptions and network flares are\ncommonly seen. Aims: The aim of this paper is (1) to describe the\ncharacteristics of the flows that lead to these energy releases, (2) to\nquantify the energy build up due to photospheric flows acting on the magnetic\nfield, and (3) to assess its contribution to the energy of small-scale,\nshort-lived X-ray flares in the quiet Sun. Methods: We used photospheric and\nX-ray data from the SoHO and Hinode spacecraft combined with tracking\nalgorithms to analyse the evolution of five network flares. The energy of the\nX-ray emitting thermal plasma is compared with an estimate of the energy built\nup due to converging and sheared flux. Results: Quiet-Sun network flares occur\nabove sites of converging opposite-polarity magnetic flux that are often found\non the outskirts of network cell junctions, sometimes with observable\nvortex-like motion. In all studied flares the thermal energy was more than an\norder of magnitude higher than the magnetic free energy of the converging flux\nmodel. The energy in the sheared field was always higher than in the converging\nflux but still lower than the thermal energy. Conclusions: X-ray network flares\noccur at sites of magnetic energy dissipation. The energy is probably built up\nby supergranular flows causing systematic shearing of the magnetic field. This\nprocess appears more efficient near the junction of the network lanes. Since\nthis work relies on 11 case studies, our results call for a follow-up\nstatistical analysis to test our hypothesis throughout the quiet Sun.",

The spacecraft's motion near\n(101955) Bennu is modelled in the rotating frame fixed at the centre of the\nasteroid, neglecting the sun gravity effects. We calculate the solar radiation\npressure at the perihelion, semi-major axis and aphelion distances of the\nasteroid from the Sun. The goals of this work are to analyse the stability for\nboth homogeneous and inhomogeneous mass distribution and study the effects of\nthe solar radiation pressure in equatorial orbits close to the asteroid\n(101955) Bennu. As results, we find that the mascon model divided into ten\nequal layers seems to be the most suitable for this problem. We can highlight\nthat the centre point $E$8, which was linearly stable in the case of the\nhomogeneous mass distribution, becomes unstable in this new model changing its\ntopological structure. For a Sun initial longitude $\\psi_0 = -180^o$, starting\nwith the spacecraft longitude $\\lambda = 0$, the orbits suffer fewer impacts\nand some (between 0.4 and 0.5 km), remaining unwavering even if the maximum\nsolar radiation is considered. When we change the initial longitude of the Sun\nto $\\psi_0 = -135^o$, the orbits with initial longitude $\\lambda = 90^0 $\nappear to be more stable. Finally, when the passage of the spacecraft in the\nshadow is accounted for, the effects of solar radiation pressure are softened,\nand we find more stable orbits.",

Current methods for communication and tracking of deep space\nprobes use ground based systems such as the Deep Space Network (DSN). However,\nthe increased communication demand will require radically new methods to ease\ncommunication congestion. Networks of communication relay satellites located at\nstrategic locations such as geostationary orbit and Lagrange points are\npotential solutions. Instead of one large communication relay satellite, we\ncould have scores of small satellites that utilize phase arrays to effectively\noperate as one large satellite. Excess payload capacity on rockets can be used\nto warehouse more small satellites in the communication network. The advantage\nof this network is that even if one or a few of the satellites are damaged or\ndestroyed, the network still operates but with degraded performance. The\nsatellite network would operate in a distributed architecture and some\nsatellites maybe dynamically repurposed to split and communicate with multiple\ntargets at once. The potential for this alternate communication architecture is\nsignificant, but this requires development of satellite formation flying and\nnetworking technologies. Our research has found neural-network control\napproaches such as the Artificial Neural Tissue can be effectively used to\ncontrol multirobot/multi-spacecraft systems and can produce human competitive\ncontrollers. We have been developing a laboratory experiment platform called\nAthena to develop critical spacecraft control algorithms and cognitive\ncommunication methods. We briefly report on the development of the platform and\nour plans to gain insight into communication phase arrays for space.",

Data acquired within a few hundred km from the nucleus are dominated by a\nwarm component with electron temperature typically 5--10 eV at all heliocentric\ndistances covered (1.25 to 3.83 AU). A cold component, with temperature no\nhigher than about 0.1 eV, appears in the data as short (few to few tens of\nseconds) pulses of high probe current, indicating local enhancement of plasma\ndensity as well as a decrease in electron temperature. These pulses first\nappeared around 3 AU and were seen for longer periods close to perihelion. The\ngeneral pattern of pulse appearance follows that of neutral gas and plasma\ndensity. We have not identified any periods with only cold electrons present.\nThe electron flux to Rosetta was always dominated by higher energies, driving\nthe spacecraft potential to order -10 V. The warm (5--10 eV) electron\npopulation is interpreted as electrons retaining the energy they obtained when\nreleased in the ionisation process. The sometimes observed cold populations\nwith electron temperatures below 0.1 eV verify collisional cooling in the coma.\nThe cold electrons were only observed together with the warm population. The\ngeneral appearance of the cold population appears to be consistent with a\nHaser-like model, implicitly supporting also the coupling of ions to the\nneutral gas.

Solar observatories are providing the world-wide community with a\nwealth of data, covering large time ranges, multiple viewpoints, and returning\nlarge amounts of data. In particular, the large volume of SDO data presents\nchallenges: it is available only from a few repositories, and full-disk,\nfull-cadence data for reasonable durations of scientific interest are difficult\nto download practically due to their size and download data rates available to\nmost users. From a scientist's perspective this poses three problems:\naccessing, browsing and finding interesting data as efficiently as possible.\nAims. To address these challenges, we have developed JHelioviewer, a\nvisualisation tool for solar data based on the JPEG2000 compression standard\nand part of the open source ESA/NASA Helioviewer Project. Since the first\nrelease of JHelioviewer, the scientific functionality of the software has been\nextended significantly, and the objective of this paper is to highlight these\nimprovements.\nMethods. The JPEG2000 standard offers useful new features that facilitate the\ndissemination and analysis of high-resolution image data and offers a solution\nto the challenge of efficiently browsing petabyte-scale image archives. The\nJHelioviewer software is open source, platform independent and extendable via a\nplug-in architecture.\nResults. With JHelioviewer, users can visualise the Sun for any time period\nbetween September 1991 and today. They can perform basic image processing in\nreal time, track features on the Sun and interactively overlay magnetic field\nextrapolations. The software integrates solar event data and a time line\ndisplay. As a first step towards supporting science planning of the upcoming\nSolar Orbiter mission, JHelioviewer offers a virtual camera model that enables\nusers to set the vantage point to the location of a spacecraft or celestial\nbody at any given time.",

The difference persists three\ndays and then fades away. Three other SEP events show less-extreme variation in\nsource temperatures at different spacecraft, in one case observed over 222 deg\nin longitude.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Cometary dust provides a unique window on dust growth mechanisms during the\nonset of planet formation. Measurements by the Rosetta spacecraft show that the\ndust in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has a granular structure at\nsize scales from sub-um up to several hundreds of um, indicating hierarchical\ngrowth took place across these size scales. However, these dust particles may\nhave been modified during their collection by the spacecraft instruments. Here\nwe present the results of laboratory experiments that simulate the impact of\ndust on the collection surfaces of COSIMA and MIDAS, instruments onboard the\nRosetta spacecraft. We map the size and structure of the footprints left by the\ndust particles as a function of their initial size (up to several hundred um)\nand velocity (up to 6 m/s). We find that in most collisions, only part of the\ndust particle is left on the target; velocity is the main driver of the\nappearance of these deposits. A boundary between sticking/bouncing and\nfragmentation as an outcome of the particle-target collision is found at v ~ 2\nm/s. For velocities below this value, particles either stick and leave a single\ndeposit on the target plate, or bounce, leaving a shallow footprint of\nmonomers. At velocities > 2 m/s and sizes > 80 um, particles fragment upon\ncollision, transferring up to 50 per cent of their mass in a rubble-pile-like\ndeposit on the target plate. The amount of mass transferred increases with the\nimpact velocity. The morphologies of the deposits are qualitatively similar to\nthose found by the COSIMA instrument.",

Accumulating experiences in\nastrophysical, chemical, and climatological characterization of uninhabitable\nplanets are paving the way to characterization of potentially habitable\nplanets. In this paper, we review our possibilities and limitations in\ncharacterizing temperate terrestrial planets with future observational\ncapabilities through 2030s and beyond, as a basis of a broad range of\ndiscussions on how to advance \"astrobiology\" with exoplanets. We discuss the\nobservability of not only the proposed biosignature candidates themselves, but\nalso of more general planetary properties that provide circumstantial evidence,\nsince the evaluation of any biosignature candidate relies on their context.\nCharacterization of temperate Earth-size planets in the coming years will focus\non those around nearby late-type stars. JWST and later 30 meter-class\nground-based telescopes will empower their chemical investigations.\nSpectroscopic studies of potentially habitable planets around solar-type stars\nwill likely require a designated spacecraft mission for direct imaging,\nleveraging technologies that are already being developed and tested as part of\nthe WFIRST mission. Successful initial characterization of a few nearby targets\nwill be an important touchstone toward a more detailed scrutiny and a larger\nsurvey that are envisioned beyond 2030.

Such a determination is complicated by the complex\nnature of the turbulence as well as observational constraints, chiefly that in\nsitu measurements of such plasmas are typically only available at a single\npoint in space. Recent work has shown that correlations between electric fields\nand particle velocity distributions constructed from single-point measurements\nproduce a velocity-dependent signature of the collisionless damping mechanism.\nWe extend this work by constructing field-particle correlations using data sets\ndrawn from single points in strongly driven, turbulent, electromagnetic\ngyrokinetic simulations to demonstrate that this technique can identify the\ncollisionless mechanisms operating in such systems. The correlation's\nvelocity-space structure agrees with expectations of resonant mechanisms\ntransferring energy collisionlessly in turbulent systems. This work motivates\nthe eventual application of field-particle correlations to spacecraft\nmeasurements in the solar wind, with the ultimate goal to determine the\nphysical mechanisms that dissipate magnetized plasma turbulence.",

The PACS and SPIRE\nphotometric cameras observed about 8% of the sky in six different wavebands.\nThis document describes the Herschel/PACS Point Source Catalogue (HPPSC), a FIR\ncatalogue based on the broad-band photometric observations of the PACS\ninstrument with filters centred at 70, 100 and 160 microns.\nWe analysed 14842 combined, Level 2.5/Level 3 Herschel/PACS photometric\nobservations. The PACS photometer maps were generated by the JScanam task of\nthe Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE) v13.0.0. Sources were\nidentified with the HIPE implementation of SUSSEXtractor, and the flux\ndensities obtained by aperture photometry. We found a total of 108 319 point\nsources that are considered to be reliable in the 70 micron maps, 131 322 at\n100 micron and 251 392 point sources in the 160 micron maps. In addition, our\nquality control algorithm identified 546 587 candidate sources that were found\nto be extended and 7 185 160 features which did not pass the signal-to-noise\nand other criteria to be considered reliable sources. These sources were\nincluded in the Extended Source List and Rejected Source List of the HPPSC,\nrespectively. The calculated completeness and photometric accuracy values are\nbased on simulations, where artificial sources were injected into the\nobservational timeline with well controlled flux density values. The actual\ncompleteness is a complex function of the source flux, photometric band and the\nbackground complexity.",

If humanity could\nbuild high-speed interstellar lightsails and reach the alpha Centauri system 20\nyr after launch, would it be better to wait a few years, then take advantage of\nfurther technology improvements to increase the speed, and arrive earlier\ndespite waiting? The risk of being overtaken by a future, faster probe has been\ndescribed earlier as the incentive trap. Based on 211 yr of historical data, we\nfind that the speed growth of human-made vehicles, from steam-driven\nlocomotives to Voyager 1, is much faster than previously believed, about 4.72 %\nannually or a doubling every 15 yr. We derive the mathematical framework to\ncalculate the minimum of the wait time (t) plus travel time (tau(t)) and extend\ntwo exponential growth law models into the relativistic regime. We show that\nthe minimum of t+tau(t) disappears for nearby targets. There is no use of\nwaiting for speed improvements once we can reach an object within about 20 yr\nof travel, irrespective of the actual speed. In terms of speed, the t+tau(t)\nminimum for a travel to alpha Centauri will occur once 19.6 % the speed of\nlight (c) become available, in agreement with the 20 % c proposed by the\nBreakthrough Starshot Initiative. If interstellar travel at 20 % c can be\nobtained within 45 yr from today and if the kinetic energy could be increased\nat a rate consistent with the historical record, then humans can reach the ten\nmost nearby stars within 100 yr from today.",

Previous attempts to quantify the effect of turbulence on reconnection\nusually prescribed Alfv\u00e9nic or other low-frequency fluctuations or\ninvestigated collisionless kinetic effects in just two-dimensional\nconfigurations and antiparallel magnetic fields. In view of this, we analyzed\nthe kinetic turbulence self-generated by three-dimensional guide-field\nreconnection through force-free current sheets in frequency and wavenumber\nspaces, utilizing 3D particle-in-cell code numerical simulations. Our\ninvestigations reveal reconnection rates and kinetic turbulence with features\nsimilar to those obtained by current in-situ spacecraft observations of MMS as\nwell as in the laboratory reconnection experiments MRX, VTF and\n\\textsc{Vineta}-II. In particular we found that the kinetic turbulence\ndeveloping in the course of 3D guide-field reconnection exhibits a broadband\npower-law spectrum extending beyond the lower-hybrid frequency and up to the\nelectron frequencies. In the frequency space the spectral index of the\nturbulence appeared to be close to -2.8 at the reconnection X-line. In the\nwavenumber space it also becomes -2.8 as soon as the normalized reconnection\nrate reaches 0.1. The broadband kinetic turbulence is mainly due to\ncurrent-streaming and electron-flow-shear instabilities excited in the\nsufficiently thin current sheets of kinetic reconnection. The growth of the\nkinetic turbulence corresponds to high reconnection rates which exceed those of\nfast laminar, non-turbulent reconnection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  ATHENA, with a launch foreseen in 2028 towards the L2 orbit, addresses the\nscience theme \"The Hot and Energetic Universe\", coupling a high-performance\nX-ray Telescope with two complementary focal-plane instruments. One of these,\nthe X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is a TES based kilo-pixel array providing\nspatially resolved high-resolution spectroscopy (2.5 eV at 6 keV) over a 5\narcmin FoV. The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several\ncomponents: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles\n(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the\nfield of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the\nspacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these\ncomponents is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental\nperformances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on\nthe background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle\nenvironment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models\nused in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the\nactivities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of\nprevious missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2\nenvironment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites\npresent in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and\ntheir occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the\nMonte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of\nreliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce\nthe particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the\nscientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA. While the activities\nare still ongoing, we present here some preliminary results already obtained by\nthe group.",

The role of the navigation and flight\ndynamics team is critical for the spacecraft to execute a precisely planned\nsampling maneuver over a specifically-selected landing site. In particular, the\norientation of Bennu needs to be recovered with good accuracy during orbital\noperations to contribute as small an error as possible to the landing error\nbudget. Although Bennu is well characterized from Earth-based radar\nobservations, its orientation dynamics are not sufficiently known to exclude\nthe presence of a small wobble. To better understand this contingency and\nevaluate how well the orientation can be recovered in the presence of a large\n1$^{\\circ}$ wobble, we conduct a comprehensive simulation with the NASA GSFC\nGEODYN orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation software. We\ndescribe the dynamic orientation modeling implemented in GEODYN in support of\nOSIRIS-REx operations, and show how both altimetry and imagery data can be used\nas either undifferenced (landmark, direct altimetry) or differenced (image\ncrossover, altimetry crossover) measurements. We find that these two different\ntypes of data contribute differently to the recovery of instrument pointing or\nplanetary orientation. When upweighted, the absolute measurements help reduce\nthe geolocation errors, despite poorer astrometric (inertial) performance. We\nfind that with no wobble present, all the geolocation requirements are met.\nWhile the presence of a large wobble is detrimental, the recovery is still\nreliable thanks to the combined use of altimetry and imagery data.",

This idea\nconstitutes the thesis behind the Breakthrough Starshot project, which aims to\naccelerate a gram-mass spacecraft up to one-fifth the speed of light towards\nProxima Centauri. For such a case, the combination of the sail's low mass and\nrelativistic velocity render previous treatments formally incorrect, including\nthat of Einstein himself in his seminal 1905 paper introducing special\nrelativity. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration,\nfirst in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble. We show\nhow the sail's motion in response to an ensemble of incident photons is\nequivalent to that of a single photon of energy equal to that of the ensemble.\nWe use this 'principle of ensemble equivalence' for both perfect and imperfect\nmirrors, enabling a simple analytic prediction of the sail's velocity curve.\nUsing our results and adopting putative parameters for Starshot, we estimate\nthat previous relativistic treatments underestimate the spacecraft's terminal\nvelocity by ~50m/s for the same incident energy, sufficient to miss a target by\nseveral Earth radii. Additionally, we use a simple model to predict the sail's\ntemperature and diffraction beam losses during the laser firing period,\nallowing us to estimate that for firing times of a few minutes and operating\ntemperatures below 300C (573K), Starshot will require a sail of which absorbs\nless than 1 in 260,000 photons.",

The orbital dynamics near\nasteroids are very complex. According to the variation in orbit characteristics\nafter being affected by gravitational perturbation during the periapsis\npassage, orbits near an asteroid can be classified into 9 categories: (1)\nsurroundingto-surrounding, (2) surrounding-to-surface, (3)\nsurroundingto-infinity, (4) infinity-to-infinity, (5) infinity-to-surface, (6)\ninfinity-to-surrounding, (7) surface-to-surface, (8) surfaceto-surrounding, and\n(9) surface-to- infinity. Assume that the orbital elements are constant near\nthe periapsis, the gravitation potential is expanded into a harmonic series.\nThen, the influence of the gravitational perturbation on the orbit is studied\nanalytically. The styles of orbits are dependent on the argument of periapsis,\nthe periapsis radius, and the periapsis velocity. Given the argument of\nperiapsis, the orbital energy before and after perturbation can be derived\naccording to the periapsis radius and the periapsis velocity. Simulations have\nbeen performed for orbits in the gravitational field of 216 Kleopatra. The\nnumerical results are well consistent with analytic predictions.",

The\ntransmission vs. altitude was sensitive to the presence of N2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4,\nC2H6, and haze. We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities\nfor the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction\ncoefficients for the haze. We found the following major conclusions: 1) We\nconfirmed temperatures in Pluto's upper atmosphere that were colder than\nexpected before the New Horizons flyby, with upper atmospheric temperatures\nnear 65-68 K. The inferred enhanced Jeans escape rates were (3e22-7e22) N2/s\nand (4e25-8e25) CH4/s at the exobase (at a radius of ~2900 km, or an altitude\nof ~1710 km). 2) We measured CH4 abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the\nsurface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH4 and Alice and REX N2 measurements\nimplied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient,\nmost likely between 550 and 4000 cm2/s. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient\nplaced the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small\nplanetary boundary layer. The inferred CH4 surface mixing ratio was\n~0.28-0.35%. 3) The abundance profiles of the C2Hx hydrocarbons (C2H2, C2H4,\nC2H6) were not simply exponential with altitude. We detected local maxima in\nline-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C2H4, near 320 km for C2H2,\nand an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for\nC2H6. We also detected local minima near 200 km altitude for C2H4, near 170 km\nfor C2H2, and an inflection point or minimum near 170-200 km for C2H6. These\ncompared favorably with models for hydrocarbon production near 300-400 km and\nhaze condensation near 200 km, especially for C2H2 and C2H4 (Wong et al. 2017).\n4) We found haze that had an extinction coefficient approximately proportional\nto N2 density.",

An experimental evaluation shows all\nalgorithms achieving exceptional performance on a hard benchmark problem. It is\nfound that a properly tuned deterministic Beam Search always outperforms the\nremaining variants. Beam P-ACO, however, demonstrates lower parameter\nsensitivity, while offering superior worst-case performance.

The aim of the mission is to\nmap the comet 67P Churyumov Gerasimenko by remote sensing, to examine its\nenvironment insitu and its evolution in the inner solar system.Rosetta was the\nfirst spacecraft to rendezvous and orbit a comet, accompanying it as it passes\nthrough the inner solar system, and to deploy a lander, Philae and perform in\nsitu science on the comet surface. The primary goals of the mission were to:\ncharacterize the comets nucleus; examine the chemical, mineralogical and\nisotopic composition of volatiles and refractories; examine the physical\nproperties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories in a cometary\nnucleus; study the development of cometary activity and the processes in the\nsurface layer of the nucleus and in the coma; detail the origin of comets, the\nrelationship between cometary and interstellar material and the implications\nfor the origin of the solar system; characterize asteroids, 2867 Steins and 21\nLutetia.

We used the large Ukrainian radio telescope URAN-2\nto observe type IV radio bursts in the frequency range of 8--32~MHz during the\ntime interval of 08:15--11:00~UT on August 1, 2011. Radio emission in this\nfrequency range originated at the distance of 1.5--2.5 R according to the\nBaumbach-Allen density model of the solar corona. Morlet wavelet analysis\nshowed the periodicity of 80~min in radio emission intensity at all\nfrequencies, which demonstrates that there are quasi-periodic variations of\ncoronal density at all heights. The observed periodicity corresponds to the\nacoustic cut-off frequency of stratified corona at a temperature of 1~MK. We\nsuggest that continuous perturbations of the coronal base in the form of\njets/explosive events generate acoustic pulses, which propagate upwards and\nleave the wake behind oscillating at the coronal cut-off frequency. This wake\nmay transform into recurrent shocks due to the density decrease with height,\nwhich leads to the observed periodicity in the radio emission. The recurrent\nshocks may trigger quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection in helmet streamers,\nwhere the opposite field lines merge and consequently may generate periodic\ndensity structures observed in the solar wind.",

The sail rig assumes centrifugally stretched\nmain tethers that extend radially outward from the spacecraft in the sail spin\nplane. Furthermore, the tips of the main tethers host remote units that are\nconnected by auxiliary tethers at the sail rim. Here, we derive the equation of\nmain tether shape and present both a numerical solution and an analytical\napproximation for the shape as parametrized both by the ratio of the electric\nsail force to the centrifugal force and the sail orientation with respect to\nthe solar wind direction. The resulting shape is such that near the spacecraft,\nthe roots of the main tethers form a cone, whereas towards the rim, this coning\nis flattened by the centrifugal force, and the sail is coplanar with the sail\nspin plane. Our approximation for the sail shape is parametrized only by the\ntether root coning angle and the main tether length. Using the approximate\nshape, we obtain the torque and thrust of the electric sail force applied to\nthe sail. As a result, the amplitude of the tether voltage modulation required\nfor the maintenance of the sail attitude is given as a torque-free solution.\nThe amplitude is smaller than that previously obtained for a rigid single\ntether resembling a spherical pendulum. This implies that less thrusting margin\nis required for the maintenance of the sail attitude. For a given voltage\nmodulation, the thrust vectoring is then considered in terms of the radial and\ntransverse thrust components.",

The technique developed, commonly called 'curlometer' permits a\ngood estimation of the current density when the magnetic field time series vary\nlinearly in space. This approximation is generally valid for small spacecraft\nseparation. The recent space missions Cluster and Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) have provided high resolution measurements with inter-spacecraft\nseparation up to 100 km and 10 km, respectively. The former scale corresponds\nto the proton gyroradius/ion skin depth in 'typical' solar wind conditions,\nwhile the latter to sub-proton scale. However, some works have highlighted an\nunderestimation of the current density via the curlometer technique with\nrespect to the current computed directly from the velocity distribution\nfunctions, measured at sub-proton scales resolution with MMS. In this paper we\nexplore the limit of the curlometer technique studying synthetic data sets\nassociated to a cluster of four artificial satellites allowed to fly in a\nstatic turbulent field, spanning a wide range of relative separation. This\nstudy tries to address the relative importance of measuring plasma moments at\nvery high resolution from a single spacecraft with respect to the\nmulti-spacecraft missions in the current density evaluation.",

In the solar system, MD predicts the existence of some\npossibly non-negligible dynamical effects, which can be used to constrain the\nfreedom in MD theories. Known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) have\ntheir argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node, and inclination\ndistributed in highly non-uniform fashion; ETNOs are bodies with perihelion\ndistances greater than the orbit of Neptune and with semimajor axes greater\nthan 150 au and less than $\\sim1500$ au. It is as if these bodies have been\nsystematically perturbed by some external force. We investigated a hypothesis\nthat the puzzling orbital characteristics of ETNOs are a consequence of MD. We\nset up a dynamical model of the solar system incorporating the external field\neffect (EFE), which is anticipated to be the dominant effect of MD in the ETNOs\nregion. We used constraints available on the strength of EFE coming from radio\ntracking of the Cassini spacecraft. We performed several numerical experiments,\nconcentrating on the long-term orbital evolution of primordial (randomised)\nETNOs in MD. The EFE could produce distinct non-uniform distributions of the\norbital elements of ETNOs that are related to the orientation of an orbit in\nspace. If we demand that EFE is solely responsible for the detachment of Sedna\nand 2012 VP$_{113}$, then these distributions are at odds with the currently\nobserved statistics on ETNOs unless the EFE quadrupole strength parameter\n$Q_{2}$ has values that are unlikely (with probability < 1$\\%$) in light of the\nCassini data.",

These types of maneuvers\nare frequently utilized in missions such as rendezvous and docking, satellite\ninspection and formation flight where exclusion zones representing spacecraft\nor other obstacles must be avoided. The presence of these exclusion zones leads\nto non-linear and non-convex constraints which must be satisfied. In this\npaper, a novel approach to spacecraft relative motion planning with obstacle\navoidance and thrust constraints is developed. This approach is based on a\ngraph search applied to a virtual net of closed (periodic) natural motion\ntrajectories, where the natural motion trajectories represent virtual net nodes\n(vertices), and adjacency and connection information is determined by\nconditions defined in terms of safe, positively-invariant tubes built around\neach trajectory. These conditions guarantee that transitions from one natural\nmotion trajectory to another natural motion trajectory can be completed without\nconstraint violations. The proposed approach improves the flexibility of a\nprevious approach based on the use of forced equilibria, and has other\nadvantages in terms of reduced fuel consumption and passive safety. The\nresulting maneuvers, if planned on-board, can be executed directly or, if\nplanned off board, can be used to warm start trajectory optimizers to generate\nfurther improvements.",

We find these monochromatic,\nlow-frequency, circularly-polarized waves to have a typical frequency range of\n0.2 - 0.4 Hz in the spacecraft frame. This is due to the lower ion and electron\ncyclotron frequencies near Saturn, between which whistler waves can develop.\nThe waves are also observed as predominantly right-handed in the spacecraft\nframe, the opposite sense to what is typically observed near Earth. This is\nattributed to the weaker Doppler shift, owing to the large angle between the\nsolar wind velocity and magnetic field vectors at 10 AU.

The oscillation parameters show that\nthese stars are helium-core-burning red giants. The eight stars form two groups\nwith very different oscillation power spectra; the four stars with lowest\nDelta_nu-values display rich sets of mixed l=1 modes, while this is not the\ncase for the four stars with higher Delta_nu. For the four stars with lowest\nDelta_nu, we determine the asymptotic period spacing of the mixed modes,\nDeltaP, which together with the masses we derive for all eight stars suggest\nthat they belong to the so-called secondary clump. Based on the global\noscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling which\nindicate that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence\nand in the helium-burning phase for these ~2M_sun stars. Finally, our results\nindicate less mode suppression than predicted by recent theories for magnetic\nsuppression of certain oscillation modes in red giants.",
