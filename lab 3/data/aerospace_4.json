In contrast to the mechanics of polymers that has been studied\nusing statistical mechanics approaches for decades, the coupled response under\ndeformation and electrical field has largely been modeled only\nphenomenologically at the continuum scale. In this work, we examine the physics\nof the coupled deformation and electrical response of an\nelectrically-responsive polymer chain using statistical mechanics. We begin\nwith a simple anisotropic model for the electrostatic dipole response to\nelectric field of a single monomer, and use a separation of energy scales\nbetween the electrostatic field energy and the induced dipole field energy to\nreduce the nonlocal and infinite-dimensional statistical averaging to a simpler\nlocal finite-dimensional averaging. In this simplified setting, we derive the\nequations of the most likely monomer orientation density using the maximum term\napproximation, and a chain free energy is derived using this approximation.\nThese equations are investigated numerically and the results provide insight\ninto the physics of electro-mechanically coupled elastomer chains. Closed-form\napproximations are also developed in the limit of small electrical energy with\nrespect to thermal energy; in the limit of small mechanical tension force\nacting on the chain; and using asymptotic matching for general chain\nconditions.",

The\npresented approach contains two sequential steps: first, an algorithm called\ncooperative ranging localization, formulated as an Extended Kalman Filter\n(EKF), estimates each UAV's relative pose inside the group using inter-vehicle\nranging measurements; second, an algorithm named cooperative magnetic\nlocalization, formulated as a particle filter, estimates each UAV's global pose\nthrough matching the group's magnetic anomaly measurements to a given magnetic\nanomaly map. In this study, each UAV is assumed to only perform a ranging\nmeasurement and data exchange with one other UAV at any point in time. A\nsimulator is developed to evaluate the algorithms with magnetic anomaly maps\nacquired from airborne geophysical survey. The simulation results show that the\naverage estimated position error of a group of 16 UAVs is approximately 20\nmeters after flying about 180 kilometers in 1 hour. Sensitivity analysis shows\nthat the algorithms can tolerate large variations of velocity, yaw rate, and\nmagnetic anomaly measurement noises.

For humanity to\ncreate a sustainable lunar presence, well-developed collaboration between\nhumans and robots is necessary to perform complex tasks. This paper presents a\nmethodology to assess the human factors, situational awareness (SA) and\ncognitive load (CL), associated with teleoperated assembly tasks. Currently,\ntelerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and\na valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been\ndeveloped. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder\ncreated the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation\nof a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment\ndesigned as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a\nradio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two\nconditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA).\nThe goal of the experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure\nthe operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A\nsuccessful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL\nwhile operating locally. Performance metrics showed greater SA and lower CL in\nthe local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to\ncompletion of the assembly task when operating remotely. Subjective\nmeasurements of SA and CL did not align with the performance metrics. Results\nfrom this experiment will guide future work attempting to accurately quantify\nthe human factors associated with telerobotic assembly. Once an accurate\nmethodology has been developed, we will be able to measure how new variables\naffect an operator's SA and CL to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of\ntelerobotic assembly tasks.",

Here we focus on a digital twin\nframework for linear single-degree-of-freedom structural dynamic systems\nevolving in two different operational time scales in addition to its intrinsic\ndynamic time-scale. Our approach strategically separates into two components --\n(a) a physics-based nominal model for data processing and response predictions,\nand (b) a data-driven machine learning model for the time-evolution of the\nsystem parameters. The physics-based nominal model is system-specific and\nselected based on the problem under consideration. On the other hand, the\ndata-driven machine learning model is generic. For tracking the multi-scale\nevolution of the system parameters, we propose to exploit a mixture of experts\nas the data-driven model. Within the mixture of experts model, Gaussian Process\n(GP) is used as the expert model. The primary idea is to let each expert track\nthe evolution of the system parameters at a single time-scale. For learning the\nhyperparameters of the `mixture of experts using GP', an efficient framework\nthe exploits expectation-maximization and sequential Monte Carlo sampler is\nused. Performance of the digital twin is illustrated on a multi-timescale\ndynamical system with stiffness and/or mass variations. The digital twin is\nfound to be robust and yields reasonably accurate results. One exciting feature\nof the proposed digital twin is its capability to provide reasonable\npredictions at future time-steps.

We model\ncorrelator tap outputs of the received signal to form a dictionary of\ntriangle-shaped functions and leverage sparse signal processing to choose a\ndecomposition of shifted matching triangles from said dictionary. The optimal\nsolution of this minimization problem discriminates the presence of a potential\nspoofing attack peak by observing a decomposition of two different code-phase\nvalues (authentic and spoofed) in a sparse vector output. We use a threshold to\nmitigate false alarms. Furthermore, we present a variation of the minimization\nproblem by enhancing the dictionary to a higher-resolution of shifted\ntriangles. The proposed technique can be implemented as an advanced\nfine-acquisition monitoring tool to aid in the tracking loops for spoofing\nmitigation.

However, the concept of reliability in its strict sense\nis missing in financial services. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, in a\nfirst-of-its-kind-study, we define the reliability of a bank/firm in terms of\nthe financial ratios connoting the financial health of the bank to withstand\nthe likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy. For the purpose of estimating the\nreliability of a bank, we invoke a statistical and machine learning algorithm\nnamely, logistic regression (LR). Once, the parameters are estimated in the 1st\nstage, we fix them and treat the financial ratios as decision variables. Thus,\nin the 1st stage, we accomplish the hitherto unknown way of estimating the\nreliability of a bank. Subsequently, in the 2nd stage, in order to maximize the\nreliability of the bank, we formulate an unconstrained optimization problem in\na single-objective environment and solve it using the well-known particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm. Thus, in essence, these two stages correspond to\npredictive and prescriptive analytics respectively. The proposed 2-stage\nstrategy of using them in tandem is beneficial to the decision-makers within a\nbank who can try to achieve the optimal or near-optimal values of the financial\nratios in order to maximize the reliability which is tantamount to safeguarding\ntheir bank against solvency or bankruptcy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  With the advent of NASA's lunar reconnaissance orbiter (LRO), a large amount\nof high-resolution digital elevation maps (DEMs) have been constructed by using\nnarrow-angle cameras (NACs) to characterize the Moon's surface. However, NAC\nDEMs commonly contain no-data gaps (voids), which makes the map less reliable.\nTo resolve the issue, this paper provides a deep-learning-based framework for\nthe probabilistic reconstruction of no-data gaps in NAC DEMs. The framework is\nbuilt upon a state of the art stochastic process model, attentive neural\nprocesses (ANP), and predicts the conditional distribution of elevation on the\ntarget coordinates (latitude and longitude) conditioned on the observed\nelevation data in nearby regions. Furthermore, this paper proposes sparse\nattentive neural processes (SANPs) that not only reduces the linear\ncomputational complexity of the ANP O(N) to the constant complexity O(K) but\nenhance the reconstruction performance by preventing overfitting and\nover-smoothing problems. The proposed method is evaluated on the Apollo 17\nlanding site (20.0\u00b0N and 30.4\u00b0E), demonstrating that the suggested\napproach successfully reconstructs no-data gaps with uncertainty analysis while\npreserving the high resolution of original NAC DEMs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Exploring and traversing extreme terrain with surface robots is difficult,\nbut highly desirable for many applications, including exploration of planetary\nsurfaces, search and rescue, among others. For these applications, to ensure\nthe robot can predictably locomote, the interaction between the terrain and\nvehicle, terramechanics, must be incorporated into the model of the robot's\nlocomotion. Modeling terramechanic effects is difficult and may be impossible\nin situations where the terrain is not known a priori. For these reasons,\nlearning a terramechanics model online is desirable to increase the\npredictability of the robot's motion. A problem with previous implementations\nof learning algorithms is that the terramechanics model and corresponding\ngenerated control policies are not easily interpretable or extensible. If the\nmodels were of interpretable form, designers could use the learned models to\ninform vehicle and/or control design changes to refine the robot architecture\nfor future applications. This paper explores a new method for learning a\nterramechanics model and a control policy using a model-based genetic\nalgorithm. The proposed method yields an interpretable model, which can be\nanalyzed using preexisting analysis methods. The paper provides simulation\nresults that show for a practical application, the genetic algorithm\nperformance is approximately equal to the performance of a state-of-the-art\nneural network approach, which does not provide an easily interpretable model.",

The MTSFM waveform's modulation\nfunction is represented as a finite Fourier series expansion. The Fourier\ncoefficients are utilized as a discrete set of design parameters that may be\nmodified to adapt the waveform's properties. The MTSFM's design parameters are\nadjusted to shape the spectrum, Auto-Correlation Function (ACF), and Ambiguity\nFunction (AF) shapes of the waveform. The MTSFM waveform model naturally\npossesses the constant envelope and spectrally compact waveforms that make it\nwell suited for transmission on practical radar/sonar transmitters which\nutilize high power amplifiers. The MTSFM has an exact mathematical definition\nfor its time-series using Generalized Bessel Functions which allow for deriving\nclosed-form analytical expressions for its spectrum, AF, and ACF. These\nexpressions allow for establishing well-defined optimization problems that\nfinely tune the MTSFM's properties.

The resulting optimized designs possess\nsubstantially improved sidelobe levels over specified regions in the\nrange-Doppler plane without increasing the Time-Bandwidth Product (TBP) that\nthe initialized waveforms possessed.

Advanced materials and morphing wing technologies are resulting in\nnext-generation aeroelastic systems that are characterized by highly-coupled\nand nonlinear interactions between the aerodynamic and structural dynamics. In\nthis work, we leverage emerging data-driven modeling techniques to develop\nhighly accurate and tractable reduced-order aeroelastic models that are valid\nover a wide range of operating conditions and are suitable for control. In\nparticular, we develop two extensions to the recent dynamic mode decomposition\nwith control (DMDc) algorithm to make it suitable for flexible aeroelastic\nsystems: 1) we introduce a formulation to handle algebraic equations, and 2) we\ndevelop an interpolation scheme to smoothly connect several linear DMDc models\ndeveloped in different operating regimes. Thus, the innovation lies in\naccurately modeling the nonlinearities of the coupled aerostructural dynamics\nover multiple operating regimes, not restricting the validity of the model to a\nnarrow region around a linearization point. We demonstrate this approach on a\nhigh-fidelity, three-dimensional numerical model of an airborne wind energy\n(AWE) system, although the methods are generally applicable to any highly\ncoupled aeroelastic system or dynamical system operating over multiple\noperating regimes. Our proposed modeling framework results in real-time\nprediction of nonlinear unsteady aeroelastic responses of flexible aerospace\nstructures, and we demonstrate the enhanced model performance for model\npredictive control.

The waveform also inherently includes\nbeneficial disambiguation properties. The ambiguity function of the waveform is\nderived, and theoretical bounds on the ranging accuracy are obtained.\nMeasurements were conducted in software-defined radio-based nodes in a\nthree-element distributed array, demonstrating high-accuracy unambiguous\nranging between two slave nodes and one master node.",

A discrete\ndamped dynamic system is used in this paper to explore the concept of a digital\ntwin. As digital twins are also expected to exploit data and computational\nmethods, there is a compelling case for the use of surrogate models in this\ncontext. Motivated by this synergy, we have explored the possibility of using\nsurrogate models within the digital twin technology. In particular, the use of\nGaussian process (GP) emulator within the digital twin technology is explored.\nGP has the inherent capability of addressing noise and sparse data and hence,\nmakes a compelling case to be used within the digital twin framework. Cases\ninvolving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually\nand jointly along with different levels of noise and sparsity in data. Our\nnumerical simulation results clearly demonstrate that surrogate models such as\nGP emulators have the potential to be an effective tool for the development of\ndigital twins.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For the thermal control of electronic components in aerospace, automotive or\nserver systems, the heat sink is often located far from the heat sources.\nTherefore, heat transport systems are necessary to cool the electronic\ncomponents effectively. Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are such heat transport systems,\nwhich use evaporation and condensation to reach a higher heat transfer\ncoefficient than with sole heat conduction. The operating temperature of the\nLHP governs the temperature of the electronic components, but depends on the\namount of dissipated heat and the temperature of the heat sink. For this\nreason, a control heater on the LHP provides the ability to control the\noperating temperature at a fixed setpoint temperature. For the model-based\ncontrol design of the control heater controller, the current LHP state-space\nmodel in the literature focuses on the setpoint response without modeling the\nfluid's dynamics. However, the fluid's dynamics determine the disturbance\nbehavior of the LHP. Therefore, the fluid's dynamics are incorporated into a\nnew LHP state-space model, which is not only able to simulate the LHP behavior\nunder disturbance changes, but is also used for the model-based design of a\nrobust nonlinear controller, which achieves an improved control performance\ncompared to the nonlinear controller based on the previous LHP state-space\nmodel.",

Data rates in the low Mbps can be processed on low-power ARM\nprocessors, and much higher data rates can be supported on large x86\nprocessors.

However, very high-rate systems (above 100\nMbps) are still firmly in the domain of custom and semi-custom hardware (mostly\nFPGAs). In this paper we describe an architecture and testbed for an SDR that\ncan be easily scaled to support over 3 GHz of bandwidth and data rate up to 10\nGbps. The paper covers a novel technique to parallelize typically serial\nalgorithms for phase and symbol tracking, followed by a discussion of data\ndistribution for a massively parallel architecture.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  A two-stage batch estimation algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear,\nstatic parameter estimation problems that appear in aerospace engineering\napplications is proposed. It is shown how these problems can be recast into a\nform suitable for the proposed two-stage estimation process. In the first\nstage, linear least squares is used to obtain a subset of the unknown\nparameters (set 1), while a residual sampling procedure is used for selecting\ninitial values for the rest of the parameters (set 2). In the second stage,\ndepending on the uniqueness of the local minimum, either only the parameters in\nthe second set need to be re-estimated, or all the parameters will have to be\nre-estimated simultaneously, by a nonlinear constrained optimization. The\nestimates from the first stage are used as initial conditions for the second\nstage optimizer. It is shown that this approach alleviates the sensitivity to\ninitial conditions and minimizes the likelihood of converging to an incorrect\nlocal minimum of the nonlinear cost function. An error bound analysis is\npresented to show that the first stage can be solved in such a way that the\ntotal cost function will be driven to the optimal cost, and the difference has\nan upper bound. Two tutorial examples are used to show how to implement this\nestimator and compare its performance to other similar nonlinear estimators.\nFinally, the estimator is used on a 5-hole Pitot tube calibration problem using\nflight test data collected from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which\ncannot be easily solved with single-stage methods.",

While these\nissues pose a bottleneck for the use of such models in aerospace design,\ncomputational costs can be significantly minimized by constructing special,\nstructure-preserving surrogate models called reduced-order models. Such models\nare known to incur huge off-line costs, however, which can sometimes outweigh\ntheir potential benefits.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Determining thermal and physical quantities across a broad temperature\ndomain, especially up to the ultra-high temperature region, is a formidable\ntheoretical and experimental challenge. At the same time it is essential for\nunderstanding the performance of ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC)\nmaterials. Here we present the development of a machine-learning force field\nfor ZrB2, one of the primary members of the UHTC family with a complex bonding\nstructure. The force field exhibits chemistry accuracy for both energies and\nforces and can reproduce structural, elastic and phonon properties, including\nthermal expansion and thermal transport. A thorough comparison with available\nempirical potentials shows that our force field outperforms the competitors.\nMost importantly, its effectiveness is extended from room temperature to the\nultra-high temperature region (up to ~ 2,500 K), where measurements are very\ndifficult, costly and some time impossible. Our work demonstrates that\nmachine-learning force fields can be used for simulations of materials in a\nharsh environment, where no experimental tools are available, but crucial for a\nnumber of engineering applications, such as in aerospace, aviation and nuclear.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  We consider the fusion of two aerodynamic data sets originating from\ndiffering fidelity physical or computer experiments. We specifically address\nthe fusion of: 1) noisy and in-complete fields from wind tunnel measurements\nand 2) deterministic but biased fields from numerical simulations. These two\ndata sources are fused in order to estimate the \\emph{true} field that best\nmatches measured quantities that serves as the ground truth. For example, two\nsources of pressure fields about an aircraft are fused based on measured forces\nand moments from a wind-tunnel experiment. A fundamental challenge in this\nproblem is that the true field is unknown and can not be estimated with 100\\%\ncertainty. We employ a Bayesian framework to infer the true fields conditioned\non measured quantities of interest; essentially we perform a \\emph{statistical\ncorrection} to the data. The fused data may then be used to construct more\naccurate surrogate models suitable for early stages of aerospace design. We\nalso introduce an extension of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with\nconstraints to solve the same problem. Both methods are demonstrated on fusing\nthe pressure distributions for flow past the RAE2822 airfoil and the Common\nResearch Model wing at transonic conditions. Comparison of both methods reveal\nthat the Bayesian method is more robust when data is scarce while capable of\nalso accounting for uncertainties in the data. Furthermore, given adequate\ndata, the POD based and Bayesian approaches lead to \\emph{similar} results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Reliable pose estimation of uncooperative satellites is a key technology for\nenabling future on-orbit servicing and debris removal missions. The Kelvins\nSatellite Pose Estimation Challenge aims at evaluating and comparing monocular\nvision-based approaches and pushing the state-of-the-art on this problem. This\nwork is based on the Satellite Pose Estimation Dataset, the first publicly\navailable machine learning set of synthetic and real spacecraft imageries. The\nchoice of dataset reflects one of the unique challenges associated with\nspaceborne computer vision tasks, namely the lack of spaceborne images to train\nand validate the developed algorithms. This work briefly reviews the basic\nproperties and the collection process of the dataset which was made publicly\navailable. The competition design, including the definition of performance\nmetrics and the adopted testbed, is also discussed. The main contribution of\nthis paper is the analysis of the submissions of the 48 competitors, which\ncompares the performance of different approaches and uncovers what factors make\nthe satellite pose estimation problem especially challenging.",
