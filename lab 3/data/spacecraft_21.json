    "abstract": "Abstract:  Mercury's magnetosphere is known to be affected by enhanced ram pressures and\nmagnetic fields inside interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Here we\nreport detailed observations of an ICME compressing Mercury's dayside\nmagnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on November 29\n2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and\nlater STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER\nremained in the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards\ntowards Mercury's surface until it reached and passed its closest approach to\nthe planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere. The\nmagnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's\nnightside at 400 km altitude and 84$^\\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of\ndayside magnetosphere on this orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field\nmeasured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values measured in the\norbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric\ncompression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A,\nwe show that the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more\nthan high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere. As a consequence,\nthe ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced\nsodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury's dayside magnetosphere\nhas important implications for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M\ndwarf stars, as such events may significantly contribute to planetary\natmospheric loss in these systems.",

These observations\nprovide the first uninterrupted photometry of a full spin-orbit beat cycle of\nan asynchronous polar. Twice per beat cycle, the accretion flow switched\nbetween magnetic poles on the white dwarf, causing the spin pulse of the white\ndwarf (WD) to alternate between two waveforms after each pole-switch. An\nanalysis of the waveforms suggests that one accretion region is continuously\nvisible when it is active, while the other region experiences lengthy\nself-eclipses by the white dwarf. We argue that the previously accepted periods\nfor both the binary orbit and the WD spin have been misidentified, and while\nthe cause of this misidentification is a subtle and easily overlooked effect,\nit has profound consequences for the interpretation of the system's accretion\ngeometry and doubles the estimated time to resynchronization. Moreover, our\ntimings of the photometric maxima do not agree with the quadratic ephemeris\nfrom Myers et al. (2017), and it is possible that the optical spin pulse might\nbe an unreliable indicator of the white dwarf's rotation. Finally, we use\nDoppler tomography of archival time-resolved spectra from 2006 to study the\naccretion flow. While the accretion flow showed a wider azimuthal extent than\nis typical for synchronous polars, it was significantly less extended than in\nthe three other asynchronous polars for which Doppler tomography has been\nreported.",

Ulysses\nmonitored the interstellar dust stream at high ecliptic latitudes for about 16\nyears. The three other spacecraft data sets were obtained in the ecliptic plane\nand cover much shorter time intervals.We compare in-situ interstellar dust\nmeasurements obtained with these four spacecrafts, published in the literature,\nwith predictions of a state-of-the-art model for the dynamics of interstellar\ndust in the inner solar system (Interplanetary Meteoroid environment for\nEXploration, IMEX), in order to test the reliability of the model predictions.\nMicrometer and sub-micrometer sized dust particles are subject to solar gravity\nand radiation pressure as well as to the Lorentz force on a charged dust\nparticle moving through the Interplanetary Magnetic Field. The IMEX model was\ncalibrated with the Ulysses interstellar dust measurements and includes these\nrelevant forces. We study the time-resolved flux and mass distribution of\ninterstellar dust in the solar system. The IMEX model agrees with the\nspacecraft measurements within a factor of 2 to 3, also for time intervals and\nspatial regions not covered by the original model calibration with the Ulysses\ndata set. It usually underestimates the dust fluxes measured by the space\nmissions which were not used for the model calibration, i.e. Galileo, Cassini\nand Helios. IMEX is a unique time-dependent model for the prediction of\ninterstellar dust fluxes and mass distributions for the inner and outer solar\nsystem.

The plasma in\nthe coma appeared very dynamic, and many factors control its variability. Aims.\nWe wish to identify the effects of solar flares on the comet plasma and also\ntheir effect on the measurements by the Langmuir Probe Instrument (LAP).\nMethods. To identify the effects of flares, we proceeded from an existing flare\ncatalog of Earth-directed solar flares, from which a new list was created that\nonly included Rosetta-directed flares. We also used measurements of flares at\nMars when at similar longitudes as Rosetta. The flare irradiance spectral model\n(FISM v.1) and its Mars equivalent (FISM-M) produce an extreme-ultraviolet\n(EUV) irradiance (10-120 nm) of the flares at 1 min resolution. LAP data and\ndensity measurements obtained with the Mutual Impedence Probe (MIP) from the\ntime of arrival of the flares at Rosetta were examined to determine the flare\neffects. Results. From the vantage point of Earth, 1504 flares directed toward\nRosetta occurred during the mission. In only 24 of these, that is, 1.6%, was\nthe increase in EUV irradiance large enough to cause an observable effect in\nLAP data. Twenty-four Mars-directed flares were also observed in Rosetta data.\nThe effect of the flares was to increase the photoelectron current by typically\n1-5 nA. We find little evidence that the solar flares increase the plasma\ndensity, at least not above the background variability. Conclusions. Solar\nflares have a small effect on the photoelectron current of the LAP instrument,\nand they are not significant in comparison to other factors that control the\nplasma density in the coma. The photoelectron current can only be used for\nflare detection during periods of calm plasma conditions.",

To aid in mission planning, and in\nanticipation of the unprecedented measurements to be returned, in late October,\nwe developed a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solution for the\nsolar corona and inner heliosphere, driven by the then available observations\nof the Sun's photospheric magnetic field. Our model incorporates a\nwave-turbulence-driven (WTD) model to heat the corona. Here, we present our\npredictions for the structure of the solar corona and the likely {\\it in situ}\nmeasurements that Parker will be returning over the next few months. We infer\nthat, in the days prior to 1st Encounter, Parker was immersed in wind emanating\nfrom a positive-polarity equatorial coronal hole. During the encounter,\nhowever, field lines from the spacecraft mapped to another, negative-polarity\nequatorial coronal hole. Following the encounter, Parker was magnetically\nconnected to the large, positive-polarity northern polar coronal hole. When the\nParker data become available, these model results can be used to assist in\ntheir calibration and interpretation, and, additionally, provide a global\ncontext for interpreting the localized {\\it in situ} measurements. In\nparticular, we can identify what types of solar wind Parker encountered, what\nthe underlying magnetic structure was, and how complexities in the orbital\ntrajectory can be interpreted within a global, inertial frame. Ultimately, the\nmeasurements returned by Parker can be used to constrain current theories for\nheating the solar corona and accelerating the solar wind.",

Recently, detailed information about comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has been found by a spacecraft mission Rosetta. It is\nremarkable that its tensile strength was estimated. In this paper, we measure\nand formulate the tensile strength of porous dust aggregates using numerical\nsimulations, motivated by porous dust aggregation model of planetesimal\nformation. We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations using a monomer\ninteraction model with periodic boundary condition. We stretch out a dust\naggregate with a various initial volume filling factor between $10^{-2}$ and\n0.5. We find that the tensile stress takes the maximum value at the time when\nthe volume filling factor decreases to about a half of the initial value. The\nmaximum stress is defined to be the tensile strength. We take an average of the\nresults with 10 different initial shapes to smooth out the effects of initial\nshapes of aggregates. Finally, we numerically obtain the relation between the\ntensile strength and the initial volume filling factor of dust aggregates. We\nalso use a simple semi-analytical model and successfully reproduce the\nnumerical results, which enables us to apply to a wide parameter range and\ndifferent materials. The obtained relation is consistent with previous\nexperiments and numerical simulations about silicate dust aggregates.

Five of the events show short injection histories\n(<30 min) at the Sun and ten events show long-lasting (>30 min) injections. The\nvalues of mean free path range from 0.02 AU to 0.27 AU. The inferred injection\nhistories match with the radio and soft x-ray emissions found in literature. We\nfind no dependence of the radial mean free path on the radial distance. In\naddition, we find no apparent relation between the strength of interplanetary\nscattering and the size of the solar particle release.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In October 2017, the first interstellar object within our solar system was\ndiscovered. Today designated 1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have\nnever before been observed in a celestial body. Due to these characteristics,\nan in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific value.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible\nusing current and near-term technologies however with an anticipated launch\ndate of 2020-2021, this is too soon to be realistic. This paper aims at\naddressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua in 2024\nand beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are\nanalyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a\nJupiter powered flyby, and more complex flyby schemes including a Mars and\nVenus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, we\nidentify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total\nvelocity increment of 18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048. With an\nadditional deep space maneuver before the powered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory\nwith a launch date in 2030, a total velocity increment of 15.3 km/s, and an\narrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2052 were identified. Both launch dates would\nprovide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously\nidentified 2020-2021 launch dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at\nthe Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results in heat flux values, which\nare of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe. We conclude\nthat a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and near-term\ntechnologies and there is sufficient time for developing such a mission.",

We explore the problem in a way\nthat avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization\nseeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider the speed of an\nadvancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if\nthe galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales\nshorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long\nterm behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its\nadvance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be\nreadily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions\nabout interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the\nquestion of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of\nsettled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement\ncivilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for\nwhich the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring\ncivilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results\npoint to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an\ninhabited galaxy. Finally we consider how our results can be combined with the\nfinite horizon for evidence of previous settlements in Earth's geologic record.\nOur steady-state model can constrain the probabilities for an Earth visit by a\nsettling civilization before a given time horizon. These results break the link\nbetween Hart's famous \"Fact A\" (no interstellar visitors on Earth now) and the\nconclusion that humans must, therefore, be the only technological civilization\nin the galaxy.",

It was proposed\nthat impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on\nthe dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the\nmagnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found\nto date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to\nspeculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint\nspacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the\nboundary, here we show that the resulting magnetopause motion and\nmagnetospheric ultra-low frequency waves at well-defined frequencies are in\nagreement with and can only be explained by the magnetopause surface eigenmode.\nWe therefore show through direct observations that this mechanism, which should\nimpact upon the magnetospheric system globally, does in fact occur.",

The X9.3 flare on 6 September and the X8.2\nflare on 10 September are currently the two largest during cycle 24. Both were\naccompanied by fast coronal mass ejections and gave rise to solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) events measured by near-Earth spacecraft. In particular, the\npartially-occulted solar event on 10 September triggered a ground level\nenhancement (GLE), the second GLE of cycle 24. A further, much less energetic\nSEP event was recorded on 4 September. In this work we analyze observations by\nthe Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and the Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES), estimating the SEP event-integrated spectra\nabove 300 keV and carrying out a detailed study of the spectral shape temporal\nevolution. Derived spectra are characterized by a low-energy break at few/tens\nof MeV; the 10 September event spectrum, extending up to ~1 GeV, exhibits an\nadditional rollover at several hundred MeV. We discuss the spectral\ninterpretation in the scenario of shock acceleration and in terms of other\nimportant external influences related to interplanetary transport and magnetic\nconnectivity, taking advantage of multi-point observations from the Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Spectral results are also compared\nwith those obtained for the 17 May 2012 GLE event.",

Water has been\nhighlighted by many in the space community as a credible solution for\naffordable/sustainable exploration. Water can be extracted from the Moon,\nC-class Near Earth Objects (NEOs), surface of Mars and Martian Moons Pho-bos\nand Deimos and from the surface of icy, rugged terrains of Ocean Worlds.\nHowever, use of water for propulsion faces some important techno-logical\nbarriers. A technique to use water as a propellant is to electrolyze it into\nhydrogen and oxygen that is then pulse-detonated. High-efficiency elec-trolysis\nrequires use of platinum-catalyst based fuel cells. Even trace ele-ments of\nsulfur and carbon monoxide found on planetary bodies can poison these cells\nmaking them unusable. In this work, we develop steam-based propulsion that\navoids the technological barriers of electrolyzing impure water as propellant.\nUsing a solar concentrator, heat is used to extract the water which is then\ncondensed as a liquid and stored. Steam is then formed using the solar thermal\nreflectors to concentrate the light into a nanoparticle-water mix.

The availability of precise rotation-axis\norientation and position data from the Rosetta mission allows one to accurately\ndetermine the outgassing of comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko/67P. We derive the\nobserved non-gravitational acceleration of 67P directly from the Rosetta\nspacecraft trajectory. From the non-gravitational acceleration we recover the\ndiurnal outgassing variations and study a possible delay of the sublimation\nresponse with respect to the peak solar illumination. This allows us to compare\nthe non-gravitational acceleration of 67P with expectations based on empirical\nmodels and common assumptions about the sublimation process. We use an\niterative orbit refinement and Fourier decomposition of the diurnal activity to\nderive the outgassing induced non-gravitational acceleration. The uncertainties\nof the data reduction are established by a sensitivity analysis of an ensemble\nof best-fit orbits for comet 67P. We find that the Marsden non-gravitational\nacceleration parameters reproduce part of the non-gravitational acceleration\nbut need to be augmented by an analysis of the nucleus geometry and surface\nillumination to draw conclusions about the sublimation process on the surface.\nThe non-gravitational acceleration follows closely the subsolar latitude\n(seasonal illumination), with a small lag angle with respect to local noon\naround perihelion.

Due to these\nreasons, missions to small bodies are actively being pursued. However, the\nsurfaces of small bodies contain unpredictable and interesting features such as\ncraters, dust, and granular matter, which need to be observed carefully before\na lander mission is even considered. This presents the need for a surveillance\nspacecraft to observe the surface of small bodies where these features exist.\nWhile traditionally, the small body exploration has been performed by a large\nmonolithic spacecraft, a group of small, low-cost spacecraft can enhance the\nobservational value of the mission. Such a spacecraft swarm has the advantage\nof providing longer observation time and is also tolerant to single point\nfailures. In order to optimize a space-craft swarm mission design, we proposed\nthe Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of Swarms (IDEAS) software which\nwill serve as an end-to-end tool for theoretical swarm mission design. The\ncurrent work will focus on developing the Automated Swarm Designer module of\nthe IDEAS software by extending its capabilities for exploring surface features\non small bodies while focusing on the attitude behaviors of the spacecraft in\nthe swarm. We begin by classifying space-craft swarms into 5 classes based on\nthe level of coordination. In the current work, we design Class 2 swarms, whose\nspacecraft operate in a decentralized fashion but coordinate for communication.\nWe demonstrate the Class 2 swarm in 2 different configurations, based on the\nroles of the participating spacecraft.",

Radar images with a resolution of 75 m per\npixel reveal a roughly spheroidal shape more than 6 km in diameter at the\nequator with several discernible surface features hundreds of meters in extent.\nThese include a possible crater more than 1 km across located below\n30$^{\\circ}$ latitude and a roughly 600-m radar-dark region near one of the\npoles. Overall, the radar images of Phaethon are reminiscent of those of\n(101955) Bennu, target of the OSIRIS-REx mission. As such, the shape of\nPhaethon is suspected to have an equatorial ridge similar to the top-shaped\nmodels of several other radar-observed near-Earth asteroids as well as the\noptical images of (162173) Ryugu returned by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft.\nPreliminary analysis of the radar data finds no satellites and gives no\nindication of a dusty coma at the time of these observations.",

This\nwill result in many obsolete, damaged and abandoned satellites that will remain\non-orbit beyond 25 years. These abandoned satellites and space debris maybe\neconomically valuable orbital real-estate and resources that can be reused,\nrepaired or upgraded for future use. Space traffic management is critical to\nrepair damaged satellites, divert satellites into warehouse orbits and\neffectively de-orbit satellites and space debris that are beyond repair and\nsalvage. Current methods for on-orbit capture, servicing and repair require a\nlarge service satellite. However, by accessing abandoned satellites and space\ndebris, there is an inherent heightened risk of damage to a servicing\nspacecraft. Sending multiple small-robots with each robot specialized in a\nspecific task is a credible alternative, as the system is simple and\ncost-effective and where loss of one or more robots does not end the mission.\nIn this work, we outline an end to end multirobot system to capture damaged and\nabandoned spacecraft for salvaging, repair and for de-orbiting. We analyze the\nfeasibility of sending multiple, decentralized robots that can work\ncooperatively to perform capture of the target satellite as a first step,\nfollowed by crawling onto damage satellites to perform detailed mapping. After\nobtaining a detailed map of the satellite, the robots will proceed to either\nrepair and replace or dismantle components for salvage operations. Finally, the\nremaining components will be packaged with a de-orbit device for accelerated\nde-orbit.",

Using data from the MESSENGER, Venus Express\nand ACE spacecraft, we analyze with the superposed epoch technique the profiles\nof ICME substructures, namely the sheath and the magnetic ejecta. We determine\nthat the median magnetic field magnitude in the sheath correlates well with\nICME speeds at 1 AU and we use this proxy to order the ICMEs at all spacecraft.\nWe then investigate the typical ICME profiles for three categories equivalent\nto slow, intermediate and fast ICMEs. Contrary to fast ICMEs, slow ICMEs have a\nweaker solar wind field at the front and a more symmetric magnetic field\nprofile. We find the asymmetry to be less pronounced at Earth than at Mercury,\nindicating a relaxation taking place as ICMEs propagate. We also find that the\nmagnetic field intensities in the wake region of the ICMEs do not go back to\nthe pre-ICME solar wind intensities, suggesting that the effects of ICMEs on\nthe ambient solar wind last longer than the duration of the transient event.\nSuch results provide an indication of physical processes that need to be\nreproduced by numerical simulations of ICME propagation.

At\naltitudes of 600 km and lower, aerodynamic drag accelerates de-orbiting of\nsatellites. However, placement of satellites at higher altitudes required for\nconstellations pose important challenges. The satellites will require on-board\npropulsion to lower their orbits to 600 km and let aerodynamic drag take-over.\nIn this work we analyze solutions for de-orbiting satellites at altitudes of up\nto 3000 km. We consider a modular robotic de-orbit device that has stowed\nvolume of a regular CubeSat. The de-orbit device would be externally directed\ntowards a dead satellite or placed on one by an external satellite servicing\nsystem. Our solutions are intended to be simple, high-reliability devices that\noperate in a passive manner, requiring no active electronics or utilize\nexternal beamed power in the form of radio frequency, microwave or laser to\noperate. Utilizing this approach, it is possible for an external, even ground\nbased system to direct the de-orbit of a spacecraft. The role of an external\nsystem to direct the de-orbit is important to avoid accidental collisions. Some\nform of propulsion is needed to lower the orbit of the dead satellite or\norbital debris. We considered green (non-toxic) propulsion methods including\nsolar radiation pressure, solar-thermal propulsion using water steam,\nsolar-electrolysis propulsion using water and use of electrodynamic tethers.\nBased on this trade-study we identify multiple solutions that can be used to\nde-orbit a spacecraft or orbital debris.",

Small satellite missions are generally able to\nreduce mission planning, hardware, integration, and operational costs; however,\nsmall satellite missions struggle with reducing software development and\ntesting costs. This paper presents the case study of the NASA Operational\nSimulator for Small Satellites (NOS3), a software-only simulation framework\nthat was developed for the Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) 3U CubeSat mission.\nThe general approach is to develop software simulators for the various hardware\nflight components (e.g., electrical power system, antenna deployment system,\netc.) to create a completely virtual representation of the actual spacecraft\nsystem. In addition, NOS3 conveniently packages together a set of open-source\nsoftware packages including the 42 dynamics simulator, the spacecraft software\ndevelopment framework (core Flight System), and a command and control system\n(COSMOS). This results in a flexible and easily deployable simulation\nenvironment that can be utilized to support software development, testing,\ntraining, and mission operations. The NOS3 environment contributed to the\nsuccess of STF-1 mission in several ways, such as reducing the missions\nreliance on hardware, increasing available test resources, and supporting\ntraining and risk reduction targeted testing of critical software behaviors on\nthe simulated platform.

For this, we employ finite-time\nLyapunov exponents (FTLE) and sensitivity analysis and compare these two\nmethods regarding their practicality for analysing the predictability of\ndisposal orbits. The results show that FTLE are not suitable for determining if\nan orbit behaves chaotically or not on the time scale of interest.

In addition, we show that reliable re-entry disposal is feasible with\na limited \\Delta V budget. However, safe disposal into a graveyard orbit is not\nalways feasible considering uncertainties in the disposal manoeuvre and\ndynamical model when the available \\Delta V for disposal is low.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Parker spiral theory predicts the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) will have\ncomponents of opposite polarity radially toward the Sun and tangentially\nantiparallel to the solar rotation (i.e. in GSE coordinates, with Bx/By<0).\nThis theory explains the average orientation of the HMF very well but does not\npredict orthogardenhose (OGH) flux with BX/BY>0 that is often observed. We here\nstudy the occurrence and structure of OGH flux, as seen in near-Earth space\n(r=1AU) and by the Helios spacecraft at 0.29<r<1AU, in order to evaluate the\ncontributions to OGH flux generation of the various mechanisms and factors that\nare not accounted for in Parker spiral theory. We study the loss of OGH flux\nwith increasing averaging timescale between 16 seconds and 100 hours and so\ndetermine its spectrum of scale sizes. OGH flux at sunspot minimum is shown to\nbe more common than at sunspot maximum and caused by smaller-scale structure in\nthe HMF, with a mode temporal scale at a fixed point of 10hrs compared to\n40hrs. OGH generated by rotating the HMF through the radial direction is also\nshown to differ in its spectrum of scale sizes from that generated by rotating\nthe HMF through the tangential direction: the former does not contribute to the\nexcess open heliospheric flux at a given r but the latter does. We show that\nroughly half of the HMF deflection from the ideal Parker spiral giving OGH at\nEarth occurs at r below 0.3AU. We highlight some questions which can be\naddressed by the Parker Solar Probe mission which will study the HMF down to\nr=0.046AU.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Optimization of low-thrust trajectories that involve a larger number of orbit\nrevolutions is considered a challenging problem. This paper describes a\nhigh-precision symplectic method and optimization techniques to solve the\nminimum-energy low-thrust multi-revolution orbit transfer problem. First, the\noptimal orbit transfer problem is posed as a constrained nonlinear optimal\ncontrol problem. Then, the constrained nonlinear optimal control problem is\nconverted into an equivalent linear quadratic form near a reference solution.\nThe reference solution is updated iteratively by solving a sequence of\nlinear-quadratic optimal control sub-problems, until convergence. Each\nsub-problem is solved via a symplectic method in discrete form. To facilitate\nthe convergence of the algorithm, the spacecraft dynamics are expressed via\nmodified equinoctial elements. Interpolating the non-singular equinoctial\norbital elements and the spacecraft mass between the initial point and end\npoint is proven beneficial to accelerate the convergence process. Numerical\nexamples reveal that the proposed method displays high accuracy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The 2019 January 01 flypast of Ultima Thule by the New Horizons spacecraft\nhas provided the author with a new opportunity to test his gas ring model of\nplanetary origin (Prentice, 1978, Moon Planets 19 341). The model proposes that\nUltima Thule condensed from the first gas ring shed by the gravitationally\ncontracting protosolar cloud. I use the fully quantified gas ring model to\ncompute the thermal properties of the gas ring in which Ultima condensed and\nthence to predict the initial bulk chemical composition of the condensate. It\nis predicted that all KBOs initially contained large stores of CO2 ice and CH4\nices. These make up fractions 0.2210 and 0.0513 of the condensate mass,\nrespectively. Water ice makes up a mass fraction 0.1845, nearly-dry rock has\nfraction 0.5269 and graphite has 0.0163. Next, I compute the thermal evolution\nof Ultima, taking into account the radiogenic heat released by the decay of\n26Al. Stellar occultation data suggest that Ultima Thule may consist of 2 lobes\nof radius about 10 km and 7.5 km. The thermal evolution model shows that within\n0.2 Myr, the peak internal temperatures are sufficient for a fraction ~0.7 of\nthe CH4 ice in the larger lobe to melt and for a fraction ~0.4 of the CO2 ice\nto sublime. For the smaller lobe, these fractions are less. Liquid CH4 quickly\nmigrates upwards to the surface and refreezes to form a thick outer shell of\nCH4 ice. The sublimation of CO2 takes place after the melting of CH4. The\npossibility now exists for rising CO2 vapour to become trapped beneath the CH4\nshell. This may lead to explosive eruptions of the outer shell and destruction\nof the primordial surface of Ultima and loss of the CO2. If 60% of CO2 is lost,\nthe lobe radii each shrinks by ~5%. Even so, the intensity of 26Al radiogenic\nheating may not be sufficient to render the surface of Ultima Thule globally\nsmooth, unless the lobe sizes are of order ~15 km.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Sun features on its surface typical flow patterns called the granulation,\nmesogranulation, and supergranulation. These patterns arise due to convective\nflows transporting energy from the interior of the Sun to its surface. In this\npaper we will shed light on the interaction between the convective flows in\nlarge-scale cells as well as the large-scale magnetic fields in active regions,\nand investigate in detail the statistical distribution of flow velocities\nduring the evolution and formation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) active region 11190. To do so, we employed local\ncorrelation tracking methods on data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) spacecraft in the continuum as well as on processed line-of-sight (LOS)\nmagnetograms. We find that the flow fields in an active region can be modelled\nby a two-component distribution. One component is very stable, follows a\nRayleigh distribution, and can be assigned to the background flows, whilst the\nother component is variable in strength and velocity range and can be\nattributed to the flux emergence visible both in the continuum maps as well as\nmagnetograms. Generally, the plasma flows, as seen by the distribution of the\nmagnitude of the velocity, follow a Rayleigh distribution even through the time\nof formation of active regions. However, at certain moments of large-scale fast\nflux emergence, a second component featuring higher velocities is formed in the\nvelocity magnitudes distribution. The plasma flows are generally highly\ncorrelated to the motion of magnetic elements and vice versa except during the\ntimes of fast magnetic flux emergence as observed by rising magnetic elements.\nAt these times, the magnetic fields are found to move faster than the\ncorresponding plasma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  For space observatories, the glitches caused by high energy phonons created\nby the interaction of cosmic ray particles with the detector substrate lead to\ndead time during observation. Mitigating the impact of cosmic rays is therefore\nan important requirement for detectors to be used in future space missions. In\norder to investigate possible solutions, we carry out a systematic study by\ntesting four large arrays of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs),\neach consisting of $\\sim$960 pixels and fabricated on monolithic 55 mm $\\times$\n55 mm $\\times$ 0.35 mm Si substrates. We compare the response to cosmic ray\ninteractions in our laboratory for different detector arrays: A standard array\nwith only the MKID array as reference; an array with a low $T_c$\nsuperconducting film as phonon absorber on the opposite side of the substrate;\nand arrays with MKIDs on membranes. The idea is that the low $T_c$ layer\ndown-converts the phonon energy to values below the pair breaking threshold of\nthe MKIDs, and the membranes isolate the sensitive part of the MKIDs from\nphonons created in the substrate. We find that the dead time can be reduced up\nto a factor of 40 when compared to the reference array. Simulations show that\nthe dead time can be reduced to below 1 % for the tested detector arrays when\noperated in a spacecraft in an L2 or a similar far-Earth orbit. The technique\ndescribed here is also applicable and important for large superconducting qubit\narrays for future quantum computers.",

Prior to\n2014, the brightness of this ringlet did not vary much with longitude, but\nsometime in 2014 or 2015 a series of bright clumps appeared within D68. These\nclumps were up to four times brighter than the typical ringlet, occurred within\na span of ~ 120 degrees in corotating longitude, and moved at an average rate\nof 1751.7 degrees/day during the last year of the Cassini mission. The slow\nevolution and relative motions of these clumps suggest that they are composed\nof particles with a narrow (sub-kilometer) spread in semi-major axis. The\nclumps therefore probably consist of fine material released by collisions among\nlarger (up to 20 meters wide) objects orbiting close to D68. The event that\ntriggered the formation of these bright clumps is still unclear, but it could\nhave some connection to the material observed when the Cassini spacecraft\npassed between the planet and the rings.",

We used high-resolution images from the OSIRIS\nNarrow Angle Camera onboard the Rosetta spacecraft, projected onto the SHAP7\nshape model of the nucleus, to map 171 layering-related linear features which\nwe believe to represent terrace margins and strata heads. From these curved\nlineaments, extending laterally to up to 1925 m, we extrapolated the subsurface\nlayering planes and their normals. We furthermore fitted the lineaments with\nconcentric ellipsoidal shells, which we compared to the established shell model\nbased on planar terrace features. Our analysis confirms that the layerings on\nthe comet's two lobes are independent from each other. Our data is not\ncompatible with 67P's lobes representing fragments of a much larger layered\nbody. The geometry we determined for the layerings on both lobes supports a\nconcentrically layered, `onion-shell' inner structure of the nucleus. For the\nbig lobe, our results are in close agreement with the established model of a\nlargely undisturbed, regular, concentric inner structure following a generally\nellipsoidal configuration. For the small lobe, the parameters of our\nellipsoidal shells differ significantly from the established model, suggesting\nthat the internal structure of the small lobe cannot be unambiguously modelled\nby regular, concentric ellipsoids and could have suffered deformational or\nevolutional influences. A more complex model is required to represent the\nactual geometry of the layerings in the small lobe.",
