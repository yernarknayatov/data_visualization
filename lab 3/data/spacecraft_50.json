    "abstract": "Abstract:  Our recent claims of a Galactic center feature in Fermi-LAT data at\napproximately 130 GeV have prompted an avalanche of papers proposing\nexplanations ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar winds.\nBecause of the importance of such interpretations for physics and astrophysics,\na discovery will require not only additional data, but a thorough investigation\nof possible LAT systematics. While we do not have access to the details of each\nevent reconstruction, we do have information about each event from the public\nevent lists and spacecraft parameter files. These data allow us to search for\nsuspicious trends that could indicate a spurious signal. We consider several\nhypotheses that might make an instrumental artifact more apparent at the\nGalactic center, and find them implausible. We also search for an instrumental\nsignature in the Earth limb photons, which provide a smooth reference spectrum\nfor null tests. We find no significant 130 GeV feature in the Earth limb\nsample. However, we do find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature in Earth\nlimb photons with a limited range of detector incidence angles. This raises\nconcerns about the 130 GeV Galactic center feature, even though we can think of\nno plausible model of instrumental behavior that connects the two. A modest\namount of additional limb data would tell us if the limb feature is a\nstatistical fluke. If the limb feature persists, it would raise doubts about\nthe Pass 7 processing of E > 100 GeV events. At present we find no instrumental\nsystematics that could plausibly explain the excess Galactic center emission at\n130 GeV.",

On 2010 August 1, instruments on\nvarious space missions (Solar Dynamics Observatory/ Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory/Solar-TErrestrial-RElations-Observatory) monitored several CMEs\noriginating within tens of degrees from solar disk center. We compare their\nimprints on four widely separated locations, spanning 120 degree in\nheliospheric longitude, with radial distances from the Sun ranging from\nMESSENGER (0.38 AU) to Venus Express (VEX, at 0.72 AU) to Wind, ACE and ARTEMIS\nnear Earth, and STEREO-B close to 1 AU. Calculating shock and flux rope\nparameters at each location points to a non-spherical shape of the shock, and\nshows the global configuration of the interplanetary coronal mass ejections\n(ICMEs), which have interacted, but do not seem to have merged. VEX and\nSTEREO-B observed similar magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), in contrast to structures\nat Wind. The geomagnetic storm was intense, reaching two minima in the Dst\nindex (~ -100 nT), caused by the sheath region behind the shock and one of two\nobserved MFRs. MESSENGER received a glancing blow of the ICMEs, and the events\nmissed STEREO-A entirely. The observations demonstrate how sympathetic solar\neruptions may immerse at least 1/3 of the heliosphere in the ecliptic with\ntheir distinct plasma and magnetic field signatures. We also emphasize the\ndifficulties in linking the local views derived from single-spacecraft\nobservations to a consistent global picture, pointing to possible alterations\nfrom the classical picture of ICMEs.",

Broad-band photometry\nyields low levels of CO2 production at a comet heliocentric distance of 3.32 AU\nand no detectable production at 4.18 AU. We find that at these heliocentric\ndistances, large dust grains with mean grain diameters on the order of a\nmillimeter or greater dominate the coma and evolve to populate the tail. This\nis further supported by broad-band photometry centered on the nucleus, which\nyield an estimated differential dust particle size distribution with a power\nlaw relation that is considerably shallower than average. We set a 3-sigma\nupper limit constraint on the albedo of the large-grain dust at <= 0.12.

The extreme precision requested on primary science\nobjectives can only be achieved by observing a large number of galaxies\ndistributed over the whole sky in order to probe the distribution of dark\nmatter and galaxies at all scales. The extreme accuracy needed requires\nobservation from space to limit all observational biases in the measurements.\nThe definition of the Euclid survey, aiming at detecting billions of galaxies\nover 15 000 square degrees of the extragalactic sky, is a key parameter of the\nmission. It drives its scientific potential, its duration and the mass of the\nspacecraft. The construction of a Reference Survey derives from the high level\nscience requirements for a Wide and a Deep survey. The definition of a main\nsequence of observations and the associated calibrations were indeed a major\nachievement of the Definition Phase. Implementation of this sequence\ndemonstrated the feasibility of covering the requested area in less than 6\nyears while taking into account the overheads of space segment observing and\nmaneuvering sequence.

The shapes of the eclipses in some cases are not clear enough to be\ncertain they are total and the corresponding radii found should therefore be\nconsidered as lower limits.

The CME plasmas are often detected in\nO VI (3x10^5K), C III (8x10^4K), LyA, and LyB, with the low ionization plasma\nconfined to bright filaments or blobs that appear in small segments of the UVCS\nslit. On the other hand, in situ observations by the Solar Wind Ion Composition\nSpectrometer (SWICS) on board Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) have shown\nmostly high ionization state plasmas in the magnetic clouds in interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICME) events, while low ionization states are rarely\nseen. In this analysis, we investigate whether the low ionization state CME\nplasmas observed by UVCS occupy small enough fractions of the CME to be\nconsistent with the small fraction of ACE ICMEs that show low ionization\nplasma, or whether the CME plasma must be further ionized after passing the\nUVCS slit. To do this, we determine the covering factors of low ionization\nstate plasma for 10 CME events. We find that the low ionization state plasmas\nin CMEs observed by UVCS show average covering factors below 10%. This\nindicates that the lack of low ionization state ICME plasmas observed by the\nACE results from a small probability that the spacecraft passes through a\nregion of low ionization plasma. We also find that the low ionization state\nplasma covering factors in faster CMEs are smaller than in slower CMEs.",

The launch of the\nSTEREO twin observatories in October 2006 has greatly increased the number of\nmultipoint studies of ICMEs in the literature, but this field is still in its\ninfancy. To date, most studies continue to use on flux rope models that rely on\nsingle track observations through a vast, multi-faceted structure, which\noversimplifies the problem and often hinders interpretation of the large-scale\ngeometry, especially for cases in which one spacecraft observes a flux rope,\nwhile another does not. In order to tackle these complex problems, new modeling\ntechniques are required. We describe these new techniques and analyze two ICMEs\nobserved at the twin STEREO spacecraft on 22-23 May 2007, when the spacecraft\nwere separated by ~8 degrees. We find a combination of non-force-free flux rope\nmulti-spacecraft modeling, together with a new non-flux rope ICME plasma flow\ndeflection model, better constrains the large-scale structure of these ICMEs.\nWe also introduce a new spatial mapping technique that allows us to put\nmultispacecraft observations and the new ICME model results in context with the\nconvecting solar wind. What is distinctly different about this analysis is that\nit reveals aspects of ICME geometry and dynamics in a far more visually\nintuitive way than previously accomplished. In the case of the 22-23 May ICMEs,\nthe analysis facilitates a more physical understanding of ICME large-scale\nstructure, the location and geometry of flux rope sub-structures within these\nICMEs, and their dynamic interaction with the ambient solar wind.",

The very\ndisturbed heliosheath at V2 is particularly noteworthy for strong periodic\nintensity variations of the TSP just after V2 crossed the termination shock\n(2007.66) reaching a maximum between 2007.75 and 2008.0. A series of 42/21 day\nperiodicities was observed at V2 along with spectral changes of low energy TSP\nand the acceleration of 6-14 MeV electrons. Evidence is presented for the\nacceleration of TSP and electrons at the times of the 42/21 day periodicities\njust after V2 crossed the HTS. Spectra for TSP between 2-20 MeV and electrons\nbetween 2.5-14 MeV are derived for three time periods including the time of the\nHTS crossing. The energy spectra of TSP and electrons at these times of\nintensity peaks are very similar above ~3 MeV, with exponents of a power law\nspectrum between -3.0 and -3.6. The ratio of TSP intensities to electron\nintensities at the same energy is ~500. The electron intensity peaks and minima\nare generally out of phase with those of nuclei by ~1/2 of a 42 day cycle.\nThese charge dependent intensity differences and the large periodic intensity\nchanges could provide new clues as to a possible acceleration mechanism.",

This analysis is made\npossible due to recent advances in multispacecraft data interpolation,\nreconstruction, and visualization as well as results from recent modeling of\nionic charge states in MHD simulations of magnetic breakout and flux\ncancellation CME initiation. We use these advances to interpret specific\nfeatures of the ICME plasma composition resulting from the magnetic topology\nand evolution of the CME. We find that in both the data and our MHD\nsimulations, the flux ropes centers are relatively cool, while charge state\nenhancements surround and trail the flux ropes. The magnetic orientation of the\nICMEs are suggestive of magnetic breakout-like reconnection during the eruption\nprocess, which could explain the spatial location of the observed iron\nenhancements just outside the traditional flux rope magnetic signatures and\nbetween the two ICMEs. Detailed comparisons between the simulations and data\nwere more complicated, but a sharp increase in high iron charge states in the\nACE and STEREO-A data during the second flux rope corresponds well to similar\nfeatures in the flux cancellation results. We discuss the prospects of this\nintegrated in-situ data analysis and modeling approach to advancing our\nunderstanding of the unified CME-to-ICME evolution.",

This feature was first observed ahead of the\nEarth's bow shock, and the corresponding region was called the ULF wave\nforeshock, which is embedded within the planet's foreshock. The properties as\nwell as the spatial distribution of ULF waves within the Earth's foreshock have\nbeen extensively studied over the last three decades and have been explained as\na result of plasma instabilities triggered by solar wind ions backstreaming\nfrom the bow shock. Since July 2004, the Cassini spacecraft has characterized\nthe Saturnian plasma environment including its upstream region. Since Cassini's\nSaturn orbit insertion (SOI) in June 2004 through August 2005, we conducted a\ndetailed survey and analysis of observations made by the Vector Helium\nMagnetometer (VHM). The purpose of the present study is to characterize the\nproperties of waves observed in Saturn's ULF wave foreshock and identify its\nboundary using single spacecraft techniques. The amplitude of these waves is\nusually comparable to the mean magnetic field intensity, while their\nfrequencies in the spacecraft frame yields two clearly differentiated types of\nwaves: one with frequencies below the local proton cyclotron frequency (\\Omega\nH+) and another with frequencies above \\Omega H+. All the wave crossings\ndescribed here, clearly show that these waves are associated to Saturn's\nforeshock. In particular, the presence of waves is associated with the change\nin \\theta Bn to quasi-parallel geometries. Our results show the existence of a\nclear boundary for Saturn's ULF wave foreshock, compatible with \\theta Bn =\n45\u00b0 surfaces.",

To this end, I will demonstrate\nthe methods and algorithms which have been developed by the GBM team. As a\npreliminary result, I am going to highlight the spectral analysis of GRBs which\ntriggered the Swift satellite, but not GBM, and came from positions above the\nhorizon, with a favorable orientation to at least one GBM detector. The\nproperties of these GRBs are then compared to the full sample of GBM GRBs\npublished in the GBM spectral catalogue. We estimate that the lower limit for\nuntriggered GRBs in the GBM data is about 1.6 GRBs per month which corresponds\nto about 7% of the triggered GRBs",

The evolution of transient\nsolar wind structures ranging in size from < 105 km to > 106 km was\ncharacterized using one-minute time resolution observation of Interplanetary\nScintillation (IPS) made using the European Incoherent SCA Tter (EISCA T) radar\nsystem. Simultaneously, the global structure and evolution of these features\nwas characterized by the Heliospheric Imagers (HI) on the Solar TERrestrial\nRElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft, placing the IPS observations in\ncontext. Of particular interest was the observation of one transient in the\nslow wind apparently being swept up and entrained by a Stream Interaction\nRegion (SIR). The SIR itself was later detected in-situ at Venus by the\nAnalyser of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-4) instrument on the Venus\nExpress (VEX) spacecraft. The availability of such diverse data sources over a\nrange of different time resolutions enables us to develop a global picture of\nthese complex events that would not have been possible if these instruments\nwere used in isolation. We suggest that the range of solar wind transients\ndiscussed here maybe the interplanetary counterparts of transient structures\npreviously reported from coronagraph observations and are likely to correspond\nto transient magnetic structures reported in in-situ measurements in\ninterplanetary space. The results reported here also provide the first\nindication of heliocentric distances at which transients become entrained.",

The interface between\nthe lower solar atmosphere where energy is generated by subsurface convection\nand the corona comprises the chromosphere, which is dominated by jet-like,\ndynamic structures, called mottles when found in quiet regions, fibrils when\nfound in active regions and spicules when observed at the solar limb. Recently,\nspace observations with Hinode have led to the suggestion that there should\nexist two different types of spicules called Type I and Type II which have\ndifferent properties. Ground-based observations in the Ca II H and K\nfiltergrams reveal the existence of long, thin emission features called straws\nin observations close to the limb, and a class of short-lived events called\nrapid blue-shifted excursions characterized by large Doppler shifts that appear\nonly in the blue wing of the Ca II infrared line. It has been suggested that\nthe key to understanding how the solar plasma is accelerated and heated may\nwell be found in the studies of these jet-like, dynamic events. However, while\nthese structures are observed and studied for more than 130 years in the\nvisible, but also in the UV and EUV emission lines and continua, there are\nstill many questions to be answered. In this review we present observations and\nphysical properties of small-scale jet-like chromospheric events observed in\nactive and quiet regions, on the disk and at the limb and discuss their\ninterrelationship.",

The main feature of the novel approach\nis a considerable reduction in the control parameters and a consequent gain in\ncomputational speed. Each spiral is built by using a predefined pattern for\nthrust direction and switching structure. The pattern is then optimised to\nminimise propellant consumption and transfer time. The variation of the orbital\nelements due to the thrust is computed analytically from a first-order solution\nof the perturbed Keplerian motion. The proposed approach allows for a realistic\nestimation of {\\Delta}V and time of flight required to transfer a spacecraft\nbetween two arbitrary orbits. Eccentricity and plane changes are both accounted\nfor. The novel approach is applied here to the design of missions for the\nremoval of space debris by means of an Ion Beam Shepherd Spacecraft. In\nparticular, two slightly different variants of the proposed low-thrust control\nmodel are used for the different phases of the mission. Thanks to their low\ncomputational cost they can be included in a multiobjective optimisation\nproblem in which the sequence and timing of the removal of five pieces of\ndebris are optimised to minimise propellant consumption and mission duration.",

Tidal disruption of the comet\nnucleus led to a chain of sub-nuclei about 100-1000 m in diameter; these went\non to collide with the planet two years later (Chodas & Yeomans 1996). They\nwere intensively studied prior to and during the collisions, making SL9 the\nbest natural benchmark for physical models of small body disruption. For the\nfirst time in the study of this event, we use numerical codes treating\nrubble-piles as collections of polyhedra (Korycansky & Asphaug 2009). This\nintroduces forces of dilatation and friction, and inelastic response. As in our\nprevious studies (Asphaug & Benz 1994,1996) we conclude that the progenitor\nmust have been a rubble-pile, and we obtain approximately the same pre-breakup\ndiameter (about 1.5 km) in our best fits to the data. We find that the\ninclusion of realistic fragment shapes leads to grain locking and dilatancy, so\nthat even in the absence of friction or other dissipation we find that\ndisruption is overall more difficult than in our spheres-based simulations. We\nconstrain the comet's bulk density at about 300-400 kg/m^3, half that of our\nspheres-based predictions and consistent with recent estimates derived from\nspacecraft observations.",

Primarily\ndesigned to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from\nsolar-like stars, Kepler has provided high quality data for many areas of\ninvestigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry are however\naffected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics are\ndifferential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and\npointing variations. While exhibiting some impact on Kepler's primary science,\nthese systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking\nscientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales\ngreater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for\n$10^5$ stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad\npotential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and\nmitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction\npipeline and open source data analysis software have occurred to remove or\nreduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer for users\nof the Kepler data archive to understand and recognize systematic artifacts\nwithin light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of\nartifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive.\nThrough the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to\nmaximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper focuses on the restart strategy of CMA-ES on multi-modal\nfunctions. A first alternative strategy proceeds by decreasing the initial\nstep-size of the mutation while doubling the population size at each restart. A\nsecond strategy adaptively allocates the computational budget among the restart\nsettings in the BIPOP scheme. Both restart strategies are validated on the BBOB\nbenchmark; their generality is also demonstrated on an independent real-world\nproblem suite related to spacecraft trajectory optimization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Over the past few decades, various conjectures were advanced that Saturn's\nrings are Cantor-like sets, although no convincing fractal analysis of actual\nimages has ever appeared. We focus on the images sent by the Cassini spacecraft\nmission: slide #42 \"Mapping Clumps in Saturn's Rings\" and slide #54 \"Scattered\nSunshine\". Using the box-counting method, we determine the fractal dimension of\nrings seen here (and in several other images from the same source) to be\nconsistently about 1.6~1.7. This supports many conjectures put forth over\nseveral decades that Saturn's rings are indeed fractal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Kinetic plasma theory is used to generate synthetic spacecraft data to\nanalyze and interpret the compressible fluctuations in the inertial range of\nsolar wind turbulence. The kinetic counterparts of the three familiar linear\nMHD wave modes---the fast, Alfven, and slow waves---are identified and the\nproperties of the density-parallel magnetic field correlation for these kinetic\nwave modes is presented. The construction of synthetic spacecraft data, based\non the quasi-linear premise---that some characteristics of magnetized plasma\nturbulence can be usefully modeled as a collection of randomly phased, linear\nwave modes---is described in detail. Theoretical predictions of the\ndensity-parallel magnetic field correlation based on MHD and Vlasov-Maxwell\nlinear eigenfunctions are presented and compared to the observational\ndetermination of this correlation based on 10 years of Wind spacecraft data. It\nis demonstrated that MHD theory is inadequate to describe the compressible\nturbulent fluctuations and that the observed density-parallel magnetic field\ncorrelation is consistent with a statistically negligible kinetic fast wave\nenergy contribution for the large sample used in this study. A model of the\nsolar wind inertial range fluctuations is proposed comprised of a mixture of a\ncritically balanced distribution of incompressible Alfvenic fluctuations and a\ncritically balanced or more anisotropic than critical balance distribution of\ncompressible slow wave fluctuations. These results imply that there is little\nor no transfer of large scale turbulent energy through the inertial range down\nto whistler waves at small scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), Mars Express (MEX), and Venus Express (VEX)\nexperienced several superior solar conjunctions. These conjunctions cause\nsevere degradations of radio signals when the line of sight between the Earth\nand the spacecraft passes near to the solar corona region. The primary\nobjective of this work is to deduce a solar corona model from the spacecraft\nnavigation data acquired at the time of solar conjunctions and to estimate its\naverage electron density. The corrected or improved data are then used to fit\nthe dynamical modeling of the planet motions, called planetary ephemerides. We\nanalyzed the radio science raw data of the MGS spacecraft using the orbit\ndetermination software GINS. The range bias, obtained from GINS and provided by\nESA for MEX and VEX, are then used to derive the electron density profile.\nThese profiles are obtained for different intervals of solar distances: from\n12Rs to 215Rs for MGS, 6Rs to 152Rs for MEX, and form 12Rs to 154Rs for VEX.\nThey are acquired for each spacecraft individually, for ingress and egress\nphases separately and both phases together, for different types of solar winds\n(fast, slow), and for solar activity phases (minimum, maximum). We compared our\nresults with the previous estimations that were based on in situ measurements,\nand on solar type III radio and radio science studies made at different phases\nof solar activity and at different solar wind states. Our results are\nconsistent with estimations obtained by these different methods. Moreover,\nfitting the planetary ephemerides including complementary data that were\ncorrected for the solar corona perturbations, noticeably improves the\nextrapolation capability of the planetary ephemerides and the estimation of the\nasteroids masses.",

The Konus-Wind experiment has made an impressive\nnumber of important GRB observations and other astrophysical discoveries, due\nto the advantages of its design and its interplanetary location.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  When transiting their host stars, hot Jupiters absorb about 10% of the light\nin the wings of the stellar Lyman-alpha emission line. The absorption occurs at\nwavelengths Doppler-shifted from line center by +/- 100 km/s - larger than the\nthermal speeds with which partially neutral, 10E4 K hydrogen escapes from hot\nJupiter atmospheres. It has been proposed that the absorption arises from 10E6\nK hydrogen from the host stellar wind, made momentarily neutral by charge\nexchange with planetary H I. The +/-100 km/s velocities would then be\nattributed to the typical velocity dispersions of protons in the stellar wind -\nas inferred from spacecraft measurements of the Solar wind. To test this\nproposal, we perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations of colliding hot Jupiter and\nstellar winds, augmented by a chemistry module to compute the amount of hot\nneutral hydrogen produced by charge exchange. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nmixes the two winds; in the mixing layer, charge exchange reactions establish,\nwithin tens of seconds. Enough hot neutral hydrogen is generated to reproduce\nthe transit observations, and the amount of absorption converges with both\nspatial resolution and time. Our calculations support the idea that charge\ntransfer between colliding winds correctly explains Lyman-alpha transit\nobservations - modulo the effects of magnetic fields, which we do not model but\nwhich may suppress mixing. Other neglected effects include, in order of\ndecreasing importance, rotational forces related to orbital motion, gravity,\nand stellar radiation pressure; we discuss quantitatively the errors introduced\nby our approximations. How hot stellar hydrogen cools when it collides with\ncold planetary hydrogen is also considered; a more careful treatment of how the\nmixing layer thermally equilibrates might explain the recent detection of\nBalmer H-alpha absorption in transiting hot Jupiters.",
