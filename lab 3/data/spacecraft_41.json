    "abstract": "Abstract:  We investigate the light variations of 15 Am stars using four years of\nhigh-precision photometry from the Kepler spacecraft and an additional 14 Am\nstars from the K2 Campaign 0 field. We find that most of the Am stars in the\nKepler field have light curves characteristic of rotational modulation due to\nstar spots. Of the 29 Am stars observed, 12 are {\\delta} Scuti variables and\none is a {\\gamma} Doradus star. One star is an eclipsing binary and another was\nfound to be a binary from time-delay measurements. Two Am stars show evidence\nfor flares which are unlikely to be due to a cool companion. The fact that 10\nout of 29 Am stars are rotational variables and that some may even flare\nstrongly suggests that Am stars possess significant magnetic fields. This is\ncontrary to the current understanding that the enhanced metallicity in these\nstars is due to diffusion in the absence of a magnetic field. The fact that so\nmany stars are {\\delta} Scuti variables is also at odds with the prediction of\ndiffusion theory. We suggest that a viable alternative is that the metal\nenhancement could arise from accretion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii less\nthan four Earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts,\nwhich tend to be metal-rich. This implies that small, including Earth-size,\nplanets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's history\nwhen metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of\nKepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic\nthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with\nsizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true\nfive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed\ncharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis\nof the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected\nsolar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise\nage of 11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when\nthe Universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest\nknown system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets\nhave formed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history,\nleaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.\nThe age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the\nhosts to the first Galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint the\nbeginning of the era of planet formation.",

We consider the case\nin which one of the primaries is a radiating body and the other is oblate\n(although the latter is a minor effect). Beside having an intrinsic\nmathematical interest, this model is particularly suited for the description of\na mission of a spacecraft (e.g., a solar sail) to an asteroid.\nThe aim of our study is to investigate the occurrence of bifurcations to halo\norbits, which take place as the energy level is varied. The estimate of the\nbifurcation thresholds is performed by analytical and numerical methods: we\nfind a remarkable agreement between the two approaches. As a side result, we\nalso evaluate the influence of the different parameters, most notably the solar\nradiation pressure coefficient, on the dynamical behavior of the model.\nTo perform the analytical and numerical computations, we start by\nimplementing a center manifold reduction. Next, we estimate the bifurcation\nvalues using qualitative techniques (e.g. Poincar\u00e9 surfaces, frequency\nanalysis, FLIs). Concerning the analytical approach, following \\cite{CPS} we\nimplement a resonant normal form, we transform to suitable action-angle\nvariables and we introduce a detuning parameter measuring the displacement from\nthe synchronous resonance. The bifurcation thresholds are then determined as\nseries expansions in the detuning. Three concrete examples are considered and\nwe find in all cases a very good agreement between the analytical and numerical\nresults.",

By asymptotic analysis, we\nidentify most of pulsation modes. We find out two set of complete triplets, and\nfour sets of doublet which are interpreted as rotation modes with $l=1$. For\nthe other five modes, the four modes $f_{13}$, $f_{15}$, $f_{16}$ and $f_{4}$\nare identified as ones with $l=2$; and the mode $f_{7}$ is identified to be the\none with $l=1$. Meanwhile we derive a mean rotation period of $6.65\\pm0.21$ h\nfor GD 1212 according to the rotation splitting. Using the method of matching\nthe observed periods to theoretical ones, we obtain the best-fitting model with\nthe four parameters as $M_{\\rm{*}}/M_{\\rm{\\odot}} = 0.775$, $T_{\\rm{eff}} =\n11400$ K, $\\log (M_{\\rm{H}}/M_{\\rm{*}}) = -5.0$, $\\log\n(M_{\\rm{He}}/M_{\\rm{*}})=-2.5$ for GD 1212. We find that due to the gradient of\nC/O abundance in the interior of white dwarf, some modes can not propagate to\nthe stellar interior, which leads to the period spacing of the adjacent modes\nto become large. This feature is just proven by the observational data from GD\n1212. All of these imply that GD 1212 may be evolved from an intermediate mass\nstar.",

Here we\nreport the discovery of three small planets orbiting a bright (Ks = 8.6 mag) M0\ndwarf using data collected as part of K2, the new transit survey using the\nre-purposed Kepler spacecraft. Stellar spectroscopy and K2 photometry indicate\nthat the system hosts three transiting planets with radii 1.5-2.1 R_Earth,\nstraddling the transition region between rocky and increasingly\nvolatile-dominated compositions. With orbital periods of 10-45 days the planets\nreceive just 1.5-10x the flux incident on Earth, making these some of the\ncoolest small planets known orbiting a nearby star; planet d is located near\nthe inner edge of the system's habitable zone. The bright, low-mass star makes\nthis system an excellent laboratory to determine the planets' masses via\nDoppler spectroscopy and to constrain their atmospheric compositions via\ntransit spectroscopy. This discovery demonstrates the ability of K2 and future\nspace-based transit searches to find many fascinating objects of interest.",

It was first detected with NASA's \\emph{Kepler} spacecraft\nand then characterised in more detail using radial velocity follow-up\nobservations. Not only is its size very similar to that of the Earth ($1.2\nR_\\oplus$), it also has a very similar density ($5.6$ g cm$^{-2}$). What makes\nthis planet particularly interesting is that it orbits its host star every\n$8.5$ hours, giving it an orbital distance of only $0.0089$ au. What we\ninvestigate here is whether or not such a planet could have been perturbed into\nthis orbit by an outer companion on an inclined orbit. In this scenario, the\nouter perturber causes the inner orbit to undergo Kozai-Lidov cycles which, if\nthe periapse comes sufficiently close to the host star, can then lead to the\nplanet being tidally circularised into a close orbit. We find that this process\ncan indeed produce such very-close-in planets within the age of the host star\n($\\sim 600 - 900$ Myr), but it is more likely to find such ultra-short-period\nplanets around slightly older stars ($> 1$ Gyr). However, given the size of the\nKepler sample and the likely binarity, our results suggest that Kepler-78b may\nindeed have been perturbed into its current orbit by an outer stellar\ncompanion. The likelihood of this happening, however, is low enough that other\nprocesses - such as planet-planet scattering - could also be responsible.",

A wide range of behavior is possible, from fast, low amplitude\nvariations to systems in which eccentricities reach 0.9999 and inclinations\n179.9 degrees. While the orbital elements evolve chaotically, at least one\nresonant argument always librates. We show that the HD 73526, HD 45364 and HD\n60532 systems may be in chaotically-evolving resonances. Chaotic evolution is\napparent in the 2:1, 3:1 and 3:2 resonances, and for planetary masses from\nlunar- to Jupiter-mass. In some cases, orbital disruption occurs after several\nGyr, implying the mechanism is not rigorously stable, just long-lived relative\nto the main sequence lifetimes of solar-type stars. Planet-planet scattering\nappears to yield planets in inclined resonances that evolve chaotically in\nabout 0.5% of cases. These results suggest that 1) approximate methods for\nidentifying unstable orbital architectures may have limited applicability, 2)\nthe observed close-in exoplanets may be produced during the high eccentricity\nphases induced by inclined resonances, 3) those exoplanets' orbital planes may\nbe misaligned with the host star's spin axis, 4) systems with resonances may be\nsystematically younger than those without, 5) the distribution of period ratios\nof adjacent planets detected via transit may be skewed due to inclined\nresonances, and 6) potentially habitable planets in resonances may have\ndramatically different climatic evolution than the Earth.

Line-of-sight velocity maps derived from the coronal Fe XII\n$\\lambda$195.12 emission line, formed at 1.5 MK, revealed a number of\nlarge-scale, jet-like structures that showed significant blueshifts. The\nstructures had either weak or no intensity signal in 193 A filter images from\nthe Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory,\nsuggesting that the jets are essentially invisible to imaging instruments. The\ndark jets are rooted in bright points and occur both within the coronal hole\nand at the quiet Sun-coronal hole boundary. They exhibit a wide range of\nshapes, from narrow columns to fan-shaped structures, and sometimes multiple\njets are seen close together. A detailed study of one dark jet showed\nline-of-sight speeds increasing along the jet axis from 52 to 107 km s$^{-1}$\nand a temperature of 1.2-1.3 MK. The low intensity of the jet was due either to\na small filling factor of 2% or to a curtain-like morphology. From the HOP 177\nsample, dark jets are as common as regular coronal hole jets, but their low\nintensity suggests a mass flux around two orders of magnitude lower.",

Better measurements of\nnanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent to which\nit interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a\nspacecraft, it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the\nphotoelectron currents. This leads to a voltage pulse between the spacecraft\nbody and the antenna. Nanodust has a high charge/mass ratio, and therefore can\nbe accelerated by the interplanetary magnetic field to speeds up to the speed\nof the solar wind: significantly faster than the Keplerian orbital speeds of\nheavier dust. The amplitude of the signal induced by a dust grain grows much\nmore strongly with speed than with mass of the dust particle. As a result,\nnanodust can produce a strong signal, despite their low mass. The WAVES\ninstruments on the twin Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft have\nobserved interplanetary nanodust particles since shortly after their launch in\n2006. After describing a new and improved analysis of the last five years of\nSTEREO/WAVES Low Frequency Receiver data, a statistical survey of the nanodust\ncharacteristics, namely the rise time of the pulse voltage and the flux of\nnanodust, is presented. Agreement with previous measurements and interplanetary\ndust models is shown. The temporal variations of the nanodust flux are also\ndiscussed.",

We show that\nprotons locally conserve total kinetic energy when observed from an effective\nframe of reference comoving with the fluctuations. For typical properties of\nthe fast wind, this frame can be reasonably identified by alpha particles,\nwhich, owing to their drift with respect to protons at about the Alfv\u00e9n speed\nalong the magnetic field, do not partake in the fluid low frequency\nfluctuations. Using their velocity to transform proton velocity into the frame\nof Alfv\u00e9nic turbulence, we demonstrate that the resulting plasma motion is\ncharacterized by a constant absolute value of the velocity, zero electric\nfields, and aligned velocity and magnetic field vectors as expected for\nunidirectional Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations in equilibrium. We propose that this\nconstraint, via the correlation between velocity and magnetic field in\nAlfv\u00e9nic turbulence, is at the origin of the observed constancy of the\nmagnetic field: while the constant velocity corresponding to constant energy\ncan be only observed in the frame of the fluctuations, the correspondingly\nconstant total magnetic field, invariant for Galilean transformations, remains\nthe observational signature, in the spacecraft frame, of the constant total\nenergy in the Alfv\u00e9n turbulence frame.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Abundances of elements comprising solar energetic particles (SEPs) come with\ntwo very different patterns. Historically called \"impulsive\" and \"gradual\"\nevents, they have been studied for 40 years, 20 years by the Wind spacecraft.\nGradual SEP events measure coronal abundances. They are produced when shock\nwaves, driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), accelerate the ambient coronal\nplasma; we discuss the average abundances of 21 elements that differ from\ncorresponding solar photospheric abundances by a well-known dependence on the\nfirst ionization potential (FIP) of the element. The smaller impulsive\n(\"3He-rich\") SEP events are associated with magnetic reconnection involving\nopen field lines from solar flares or jets that also eject plasma to produce\naccompanying CMEs. These events produce striking heavy-element abundance\nenhancements, relative to coronal abundances, by an average factor of 3 at Ne,\n9 at Fe, and 900 for elements with 76<Z<82. This is a strong, power-law\ndependence on A/Q with a ~3.6 power when Q values are determined at coronal\ntemperatures near 3 MK. Small individual SEP events with the steepest\nenhancements (~6th power of A/Q), from ~2.5 MK plasma, are associated with B-\nand C-class X-ray flares, and with narrow (<100 deg) CMEs. Enhancements in\n3He/4He can be as large as those in heavy elements but are uncorrelated with\nthem. However, events with 3He/4He > 0.1 are even more strongly associated with\nnarrow, slow CMEs, cooler coronal plasma, and smaller X-ray flares. The\nimpulsive SEP events do not come from hot flare plasma; they are accelerated\nearly and/or on adjacent open field lines.",

To accomplish this, the Pathfinder spacecraft will perform drag-free\nflight about a test mass while measuring the acceleration of this primary test\nmass relative to a second reference test mass. Because the reference test mass\nis contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on it\nto maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces\nare a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Pathfinder system that\nare not present in the full LISA configuration.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Both Phase 1 of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1) and the full SKA have the\npotential to dramatically increase the science return from future astrophysics,\nheliophysics, and especially planetary missions, primarily due to the greater\nsensitivity (AEFF / TSYS) compared with existing or planned spacecraft tracking\nfacilities. While this is not traditional radio astronomy, it is an opportunity\nfor productive synergy between the large investment in the SKA and the even\nlarger investments in space missions to maximize the total scientific value\nreturned to society. Specific applications include short-term increases in\ndownlink data rate during critical mission phases or spacecraft emergencies,\nenabling new mission concepts based on small probes with low power and small\nantennas, high precision angular tracking via VLBI phase referencing using\nin-beam calibrators, and greater range and signal/noise ratio for bi-static\nplanetary radar observations. Future use of higher frequencies (e.g., 32 GHz\nand optical) for spacecraft communications will not eliminate the need for high\nsensitivities at lower frequencies. Many atmospheric probes and any spacecraft\nusing low gain antennas require frequencies below a few GHz. The SKA1 baseline\ndesign covers VHF/UHF frequencies appropriate for some planetary atmospheric\nprobes (band 1) as well as the standard 2.3 GHz deep space downlink frequency\nallocation (band 3). SKA1-MID also covers the most widely used deep space\ndownlink allocation at 8.4 GHz (band 5). Even a 50% deployment of SKA1-MID will\nstill result in a factor of several increase in sensitivity compared to the\ncurrent 70-m Deep Space Network tracking antennas, along with an advantageous\ngeographic location. The assumptions of a 10X increase in sensitivity and 20X\nincrease in angular resolution for SKA result in a truly unique and spectacular\nfuture spacecraft tracking capability.",

Within a\nprobabilistic framework, closed form solutions are derived for the probability\ndensity functions of the altitude distribution of particles, the distribution\nof their speeds in a rest frame both at the surface and at altitude and with\nrespect to a moving platform such as an orbiting spacecraft. These expressions\nare validated against numerically-generated synthetic populations of ejecta\nunder lunar surface gravity. The model is applied to the cases where the\nejection speed distribution is (a) uniform (b) a power law. For the latter law,\nit is found that the effective scale height of the ejecta envelope directly\ndepends on the exponent of the power law and increases with altitude. The same\nholds for the speed distribution of particles near the surface. Ejection model\nparameters can, therefore, be constrained through orbital and surface\nmeasurements. The scope of the model is then extended to include\nsize-dependency of the ejection speed and an example worked through for a\ndeterministic power law relation.

Near Earth,\nspacecraft measurements of fluctuating velocities and magnetic fields taken in\nthe time domain are translated into information about the spatial structure of\nthe solar wind via Taylor's \"frozen turbulence\" hypothesis. Near the perihelion\nof SPP, however, the solar-wind speed is comparable to the Alfv\u00e9n speed, and\nTaylor's hypothesis in its usual form does not apply. In this paper, we show\nthat, under certain assumptions, a modified version of Taylor's hypothesis can\nbe recovered in the near-Sun region. We consider only the transverse,\nnon-compressive component of the fluctuations at length scales exceeding the\nproton gyroradius, and we describe these fluctuations using an approximate\ntheoretical framework developed by Heinemann and Olbert. We show that\nfluctuations propagating away from the Sun in the plasma frame obey a relation\nanalogous to Taylor's hypothesis when $V_{\\rm sc,\\perp} \\gg z^-$ and $z^+ \\gg\nz^-$, where $V_{\\rm sc,\\perp}$ is the component of the spacecraft velocity\nperpendicular to the mean magnetic field and $\\bm{z}^+$ ($\\bm{z}^-$) is the\nElsasser variable corresponding to transverse, non-compressive fluctuations\npropagating away from (towards) the Sun in the plasma frame. Observations and\nsimulations suggest that, in the near-Sun solar wind, the above inequalities\nare satisfied and $\\bm{z}^+$ fluctuations account for most of the fluctuation\nenergy. The modified form of Taylor's hypothesis that we derive may thus make\nit possible to characterize the spatial structure of the energetically dominant\ncomponent of the turbulence encountered by SPP.",

Newly formed stars, which\nsupport both strong magnetic fields and winds, are expected to produce\nanalogous regions of CR exclusion, perhaps at elevated levels. Such young stars\nare encircled by molecular gas-rich disks, and the net removal of CRs from the\ncircumstellar environment significantly reduces the expected CR ionization rate\nin the disk gas, most likely by many orders-of-magnitude. The loss of\nionization reduces disk turbulence, and thereby affects both planet-formation\nand active chemical processes in the disk. We present models of CR exclusion\nand explore the implications for turbulence and for predicted chemical\nabundances. We also discuss means by which ALMA can be used to search for\nextrasolar heliosphere-analogs around young stars.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper develops a general observing strategy for missions performing\nall-sky surveys, where a single spacecraft maps the celestial sphere subject to\nrealistic constraints. The strategy is flexible such that targeted observations\nand variable coverage requirements can be achieved. This paper focuses on\nmissions operating in Low Earth Orbit, where the thermal and stray-light\nconstraints due to the Sun, Earth, and Moon result in interacting and dynamic\nconstraints. The approach is applicable to broader mission classes, such as\nthose that operate in different orbits or that survey the Earth. First, the\ninstrument and spacecraft configuration is optimized to enable visibility of\nthe targeted observations throughout the year. Second, a constraint-based\nhigh-level strategy is presented for scheduling throughout the year subject to\na simplified subset of the constraints. Third, a heuristic-based scheduling\nalgorithm is developed to assign the all-sky observations over short planning\nhorizons. The constraint-based approach guarantees solution feasibility. The\napproach is applied to the proposed SPHEREx mission, which includes coverage of\nthe North and South Celestial Poles, Galactic plane, and a uniform coverage\nall-sky survey, and the ability to achieve science requirements demonstrated\nand visualized.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The soft X-ray emissions of solar flares come mainly from the bright coronal\nloops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process. Their\nubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and\nenergy, although the overwhelming bulk of the total flare energy goes\nelsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP)\nin the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by\nthe standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite) spacecraft. In this paper we analyze the suitability\nof the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally\nvaluable after September, 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend the Dolla et al.\nresult to a complete list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most\nof them (80%) display QPPs in the impulsive phase. The pulsations show up\ncleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of\nirradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We\ndeploy different techniques to characterize the periodicity of GOES pulsations,\nconsidering the red-noise properties of the flare signals, finding a range of\nchracteristic time scales of the QPPs for each event, but usually with no\nstrong signature of a single period dominating in the power spectrum. The QPP\nmay also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase,\npossibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in\nGOES difference data for large irradiance values (X-class flares) makes these\nmore uncertain. We show that there is minimal phase difference between the\ndifferenced GOES energy channels, or between them and the hard X-ray variations\non short time scales. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the\nnewly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray\nvariations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper presents the past evolution of the orbital elements of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, target of the Rosetta spacecraft. The gravitational\norbit of the comet is affected by the sublimation of ice from the nucleus that\ntriggers non-gravitational forces. The comet also experienced several close\nencounters with Jupiter especially in 1959 and 1923 (less than 1 AU). These\nperturbations cause the chaoticity of the comet orbit at short time scale. The\ngoal of this paper is to have a precise idea of the comet recent dynamical\nhistory. This is done in studying the mean trends of the comet orbital elements\nand also in characterizing its chaotic motion with the Fast Lyapunov indicator.\nTo compute these mean trends, two sets (considering or not the\nnon-gravitational forces) of 1000 clone orbits of the comet were considered.\nThis paper shows that the last close encounter with Jupiter on February\n$4^{\\text{th}}$, 1959 drastically modified the orbital elements of the comet\n(especially the perihelion distance from more than 2.7 AU prior the encounter\nto 1.3 AU after the encounter). The motion of the comet is also shown to be\nchaotic before the close encounter with Jupiter on October $2^{\\text{nd}}$,\n1923. The mean trends of the orbital elements of the comet are also presented\nin this paper (for two time scales : 275 years in the past and 10,000 years in\nthe past).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Pluto and its satellites will be the most distant objects ever reconnoitered\nwhen NASA's New Horizons spacecraft conducts its intensive flyby of this system\nin 2015. The size-frequency distribution (SFD) of craters on the surfaces in\nthe Pluto system have long been expected to provide a useful measure of the\nsize distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) down to much smaller size\nscales than presently observed. However, currently predicted escape rates of\nPluto's atmosphere suggest that of order one-half to several kilometers of\nnitrogen ice has been removed from Pluto's surface over geologic time. Because\nthis range of depths is comparable to or greater than most expected crater\ndepths on Pluto, one might expect that many craters on Pluto's surface may have\nbeen removed or degraded by this process, biasing the observed crater SFD\nrelative to the production-function crater SFD. Further, if Pluto's surface\nvolatile layer is comparable to or deeper than crater depths, and if the\nviscosity of this layer surface ice is low like the viscosity of pure N2 ice at\nPluto's measured 35 K surface temperature (or as low as the viscosity of CH4\nice at warmer but plausible temperatures on isolated pure-CH4 surfaces on\nPluto), then craters on Pluto may also have significantly viscously relaxed,\nalso potentially biasing the observed crater SFD and surface crater retention\nage. Here we make a first exploration of how these processes can affect the\ndisplayed cratering record on Pluto. We find that Pluto's surface may appear to\nbe younger owing to these effects than it actually is. We also find that by\ncomparing Pluto's cratering record to Charon's, it may be possible to estimate\nthe total loss depth of material from Pluto's surface over geologic time, and\ntherefore to estimate Pluto's time-averaged escape rate.",

This paper\npresents the first part of our investigation focused on analysis of the IRIS\ndata. Our analysis of the IRIS data in different spectral lines reveals strong\nredshifted jet-like flow with the speed of ~100 km/s of the chromospheric\nmaterial before the flare. Strong nonthermal emission of the C II k 1334.5 A\nline, formed in the chromosphere-corona transition region, is observed at the\nbeginning of the impulsive phase in several small (with a size of ~1 arcsec)\npoints. It is also found that the C II k line is redshifted across the flaring\nregion before, during and after the impulsive phase. A peak of integrated\nemission of the hot (1.1 MK) plasma in the Fe XXI 1354.1 A line is detected\napproximately 5 minutes after the integrated emission peak of the lower\ntemperature C II k. A strong blueshift of the Fe XXI line across the flaring\nregion corresponds to evaporation flows of the hot chromospheric plasma with a\nspeed of 50 km/s. Additional analysis of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) data supports the idea that the upper\nchromospheric dynamics observed by IRIS has features of \"gentle\" evaporation\ndriven by heating of the solar chromosphere by accelerated electrons and by a\nheat flux from the flare energy release site.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Protons and alpha particles in the fast solar wind are only weakly\ncollisional and exhibit a number of non-equilibrium features, including\nrelative drifts between particle species. Two non-collisional mechanisms have\nbeen proposed for limiting differential flow between alpha particles and\nprotons: plasma instabilities and the rotational force. Both mechanisms\ndecelerate the alpha particles. In this paper, we derive an analytic expression\nfor the rate $Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ at which energy is released by alpha-particle\ndeceleration, accounting for azimuthal flow and conservation of total momentum.\nWe show that instabilities control the deceleration of alpha particles at $r<\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, and the rotational force controls the deceleration of alpha\nparticles at $r> r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, where $r_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\simeq 2.5\n\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ in the fast solar wind in the ecliptic plane. We find that\n$Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ is positive at $r<r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}\n= 0$ at $r\\geq r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, consistent with the previous finding that\nthe rotational force does not lead to a release of energy. We compare the value\nof~$Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ at $r< r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ with empirical heating rates\nfor protons and alpha particles, denoted $Q_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $Q_{\\alpha}$,\ndeduced from in-situ measurements of fast-wind streams from the \\emph{Helios}\nand \\emph{Ulysses} spacecraft. We find that $Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ exceeds\n$Q_{\\alpha}$ at $r < 1\\,\\mathrm{AU}$, and that $Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}/Q_{\\rm p}$\ndecreases with increasing distance from the Sun from a value of about one at\n$r=0.29 - 0.42\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ to about 1/4 at 1 AU. We conclude that the\ncontinuous energy input from alpha-particle deceleration at $r<\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ makes an important contribution to the heating of the fast\nsolar wind.",

Data from the MegaPrime camera on CFHT was used to\nbuild a precise, high density astrometric reference frame for both the final\napproach into the Pluto system and the search for the secondary target. Pluto\ncurrently lies in the galactic plane. This is a hindrance in that there are\npotential problems with confusion. However, it is also a benefit, since it\nallows the use of the UCAC4 astrometric reference catalog, which is normally\ntoo sparse for use with MegaCam images. The astrometric accuracy of the final\ncatalogs, as measured by the residuals, is 0.02 arcseconds.",

However,\nthe comet's dust tail potentially posed an impact hazard to those spacecraft.\nTo characterize the comet at large heliocentric distances, study its long-term\nevolution, and provide critical inputs to hazard modeling, we imaged C/Siding\nSpring with the Hubble Space Telescope when the comet was at 4.58, 3.77, and\n3.28 AU from the Sun. The dust production rate, parameterized by the quantity\nAf$\\rho$, was 2500, 2100, and 1700 cm (5000-km radius aperture) for the three\nepochs, respectively. The color of the dust coma is 5.0$\\pm$0.3$\\%$/100 nm for\nthe first two epochs, and 9.0$\\pm$0.3$\\%$/100 nm for the last epoch, and\nreddens with increasing cometocentric distance out to ~3000 km from the\nnucleus. The spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of the dust color\nare most consistent with the existence of icy grains in the coma. Two jet-like\ndust features appear in the north-northwest and southeast directions projected\nin the sky plane. Within each epoch of 1-2 hour duration, no temporal\nvariations were observed for either feature, but the PA of the southeastern\nfeature varied between the three epochs by ~30$^\\circ$.

We compare the estimated release time of SEPs observed at each\nspacecraft with the arrival time of the structures associated with the CME at\nthe footpoints of the field lines connecting each spacecraft with the Sun.\nWhereas the arrival of the EUV wave and CME-driven shock at the footpoint of\nSTEREO-B is consistent, within uncertainties, with the release time of the\nparticles observed by this spacecraft, the EUV wave never reached the footpoint\nof the field lines connecting near-Earth observers with the Sun, even though an\nintense SEP event was observed there. We show that the west flank of the\nCME-driven shock propagating at high altitudes above the solar surface was most\nlikely the source of the particles observed near Earth, but it did not leave\nany EUV trace on the solar disk. We conclude that the angular extent of the EUV\nwave on the solar surface did not agree with the longitudinal extent of the SEP\nevent in the heliosphere. Hence EUV waves cannot be used reliably as a proxy\nfor the solar phenomena that accelerates and injects energetic particles over\nbroad ranges of longitudes.",
