    "abstract": "Abstract:  The High Inclination Solar Mission (HISM) is a concept for an\nout-of-the-ecliptic mission for observing the Sun and the heliosphere. The\nmission profile is largely based on the Solar Polar Imager concept: initially\nspiraling in to a 0.48 AU ecliptic orbit, then increasing the orbital\ninclination at a rate of $\\sim 10$ degrees per year, ultimately reaching a\nheliographic inclination of $>$75 degrees. The orbital profile is achieved\nusing solar sails derived from the technology currently being developed for the\nSolar Cruiser mission, currently under development.\nHISM remote sensing instruments comprise an imaging spectropolarimeter\n(Doppler imager / magnetograph) and a visible light coronagraph. The in-situ\ninstruments include a Faraday cup, an ion composition spectrometer, and\nmagnetometers. Plasma wave measurements are made with electrical antennas and\nhigh speed magnetometers.\nThe $7,000\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$ sail used in the mission assessment is a direct\nextension of the 4-quadrant $1,666\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$ Solar Cruiser design and\nemploys the same type of high strength composite boom, deployment mechanism,\nand membrane technology. The sail system modelled is spun (~1 rpm) to assure\nrequired boom characteristics with margin. The spacecraft bus features a\nfine-pointing 3-axis stabilized instrument platform that allows full science\nobservations as soon as the spacecraft reaches a solar distance of 0.48 AU.",

Since this planet has not yet been observationally found\nwith conventional telescope research, it has been argued that it could be a\ndark compact object, namely a black hole of probably primordial origin. Within\nthis assumption, we discuss the possibility of detecting Planet 9 via a\nsub-relativistic spacecraft fly-by and the measure of its Hawking radiation in\nthe radio band and conclude that it is too faint compared to the CMB. We thus\npresent other perspectives with rather a satellite mission and conclude that\nsmaller black holes would give much more interesting signals.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  There has been important understanding of the process by which a hypersonic\ndust impact makes an electrical signal on a spacecraft sensor, leading to a\nfuller understanding of the physics. Zaslavsky (2015) showed that the most\nimportant signal comes from the charging of the spacecraft, less from charging\nof an antenna. The present work is an extension of the work of Zaslavsky. An\nanalytical treatment of the physics of a hypersonic dust impact and the\nmechanism for generating an electrical signal in a sensor, an antenna, is\npresented. The treatment is compared with observations from STEREO and Parker\nSolar Probe. A full treatment of this process by simulations seems beyond\npresent computer capabilities, but some parts of the treatment can must depend\non simulations but other features can be better understood through analytical\ntreatment. Evidence for a somewhat larger contribution from the antenna part of\nthe signal than in previous publications is presented. Importance of\nelectrostatic forces in forming the exiting plasma cloud is emphasized.\nElectrostatic forces lead to a rapid expansion of the escaping cloud, so that\nit expands more rapidly than escapes, and frequently surrounds one or more\nantennas. This accounts for the ability of dipole antennas to detect dust\nimpacts. Some progress toward an understanding occasional negative charging of\nan antenna is presented, together with direct evidence of such charging. Use of\nlaboratory measurements of charge to estimate size of spacecraft impacts are\nshown to be not reliable without further calibration work.",

A two-step FD is often regarded as a textbook example, which presumably\nowes its specific morphology to the fact that the measuring instrument passed\nthrough the ICME head-on, encountering first the shock front (if developed),\nthen the sheath and finally the CME magnetic structure. The interaction of GCRs\nand the shock/sheath region, as well as the CME magnetic structure, occurs all\nthe way from Sun to Earth, therefore, FDs are expected to reflect the\nevolutionary properties of CMEs and their sheaths. We apply modelling to\ndifferent ICME regions in order to obtain a generic two-step FD profile, which\nqualitatively agrees with our current observation-based understanding of FDs.\nWe next adapt the models for energy dependence to enable comparison with\ndifferent GCR measurement instruments (as they measure in different particle\nenergy ranges). We test these modelling efforts against a set of\nmulti-spacecraft observations of the same event, using the Forbush decrease\nmodel for the expanding flux rope (ForbMod). We find a reasonable agreement of\nthe ForbMod model for the GCR depression in the CME magnetic structure with\nmulti-spacecraft measurements, indicating that modelled FDs reflect well the\nCME evolution.",

The remarkable bimodal\ndistribution of elevations in both planets is one of the most striking global\nfeatures suggesting similar geodynamic processes of crustal differentiation on\nEarth and Mars. There also exist several evidences, based on geographic\nfeatures resembling ancient shorelines, for existence of an ancient martian\nocean in the northern hemisphere which covers nearly one third of the planet's\nsurface. However, the interpretation of some features as ancient shorelines has\nbeen thoroughly challenged that left the existence of a primordial martian\nocean controversial. Moreover, if oceans were formerly present on Mars, there\nis still a big ambiguity about the volume of water with the estimations ranging\nover $4$ orders of magnitude. Here we map the martian sea level problem onto a\npercolation model that provides strong evidence that the longest iso-height\nline on Mars that separates the northern and southern hemispheres, acts as a\ncritical level height with divergent correlation length and plays the same role\nas the present mean sea level does on Earth. Our results unravel remarkable\nsimilarities between Mars and Earth, posing a testable hypothesis about the\nlevel of the ancient ocean on Mars that can be answered experimentally by the\nfuture investigations and spacecraft exploration.",

This represents a surge of data on the Saturn system.\nMachine learning can help scientists work with data on this larger scale.\nUnlike many applications of machine learning, a primary use in planetary space\nphysics applications is to infer behavior about the system itself. This raises\nthree concerns: first, the performance of the machine learning model, second,\nthe need for interpretable applications to answer scientific questions, and\nthird, how characteristics of spacecraft data change these applications. In\ncomparison to these concerns, uses of black box or un-interpretable machine\nlearning methods tend toward evaluations of performance only either ignoring\nthe underlying physical process or, less often, providing misleading\nexplanations for it. We build off a previous effort applying a semi-supervised\nphysics-based classification of plasma instabilities in Saturn's magnetosphere.\nWe then use this previous effort in comparison to other machine learning\nclassifiers with varying data size access, and physical information access. We\nshow that incorporating knowledge of these orbiting spacecraft data\ncharacteristics improves the performance and interpretability of machine\nlearning methods, which is essential for deriving scientific meaning. Building\non these findings, we present a framework on incorporating physics knowledge\ninto machine learning problems targeting semi-supervised classification for\nspace physics data in planetary environments.

It thus seems more likely that the orbit of\nCharon circularized before its ocean froze, and that either tidal stresses\nalone were insufficient to fracture the surface or subsequent resurfacing\nremove these ancient fractures.",

The key observation is the biased inter-satellite\nrange, which is measured primarily by a K-Band Ranging system (KBR) in GRACE\nand GRACE Follow-On. The GRACE Follow-On satellites are additionally equipped\nwith a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI), which provides measurements with\nlower noise compared to the KBR. The biased range of KBR and LRI needs to be\nconverted for gravity field recovery into an instantaneous range, i.e. the\nbiased Euclidean distance between the satellites' center-of-mass at the same\ntime. One contributor to the difference between measured and instantaneous\nrange arises due to the non-zero travel time of electro-magnetic waves between\nthe spacecraft. We revisit the calculation of the light time correction (LTC)\nfrom first principles considering general relativistic effects and\nstate-of-the-art models of Earth's potential field. The novel analytical\nexpressions for the LTC of KBR and LRI can circumvent numerical limitations of\nthe classical approach. The dependency of the LTC on geopotential models and on\nthe parameterization is studied, and afterwards the results are compared\nagainst the LTC provided in the official datasets of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On.\nIt is shown that the new approach has a significantly lower noise, well below\nthe instrument noise of current instruments, especially relevant for the LRI,\nand even if used with kinematic orbit products.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The recent simulations showed that the whistler heat flux instability, which\npresumably produces the most of quasi-parallel coherent whistler waves in the\nsolar wind, is not efficient in regulating the electron heat conduction. In\naddition, recent spacecraft measurements indicated that some fraction of\ncoherent whistler waves in the solar wind may propagate anti-parallel to the\nelectron heat flux, being produced due to a perpendicular temperature\nanisotropy of suprathermal electrons. We present analysis of properties of\nparallel and anti-parallel whistler waves unstable at electron heat fluxes and\ntemperature anisotropies of suprathermal electrons typical of the pristine\nsolar wind. Assuming the electron population consisting of counter-streaming\ndense thermal core and tenuous suprathermal halo populations, we perform a\nlinear stability analysis to demonstrate that anti-parallel whistler waves are\nexpected to have smaller frequencies, wave numbers and growth rates compared to\nparallel whistler waves. The stability analysis is performed over a wide range\nof parameters of core and halo electron populations. Using the quasi-linear\nscaling relation we show that anti-parallel whistler waves saturate at\namplitudes of one order of magnitude smaller than parallel whistler waves,\nwhich is at about $10^{-3}\\;B_0$ in the pristine solar wind. The analysis shows\nthat the presence of anti-parallel whistler waves in the pristine solar wind is\nmore likely to be obscured by turbulent magnetic field fluctuations, because of\nlower frequencies and smaller amplitudes compared to parallel whistler waves.\nThe presented results will be also valuable for numerical simulations of the\nelectron heat flux regulation in the solar wind.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The slow solar wind is typically characterized as having low Alfv\u00e9nicity.\nHowever, Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed predominately Alfv\u00e9nic slow solar\nwind during several of its initial encounters. From its first encounter\nobservations, about 55.3\\% of the slow solar wind inside 0.25 au is highly\nAlfv\u00e9nic ($|\\sigma_C| > 0.7$) at current solar minimum, which is much higher\nthan the fraction of quiet-Sun-associated highly Alfv\u00e9nic slow wind observed\nat solar maximum at 1 au. Intervals of slow solar wind with different\nAlfv\u00e9nicities seem to show similar plasma characteristics and temperature\nanisotropy distributions. Some low Alfv\u00e9nicity slow wind intervals even show\nhigh temperature anisotropies, because the slow wind may experience\nperpendicular heating as fast wind does when close to the Sun. This signature\nis confirmed by Wind spacecraft measurements as we track PSP observations to 1\nau. Further, with nearly 15 years of Wind measurements, we find that the\ndistributions of plasma characteristics, temperature anisotropy and helium\nabundance ratio ($N_\\alpha/N_p$) are similar in slow winds with different\nAlfv\u00e9nicities, but the distributions are different from those in the fast\nsolar wind. Highly Alfv\u00e9nic slow solar wind contains both helium-rich\n($N_\\alpha/N_p\\sim0.045$) and helium-poor ($N_\\alpha/N_p\\sim0.015$)\npopulations, implying it may originate from multiple source regions. These\nresults suggest that highly Alfv\u00e9nic slow solar wind shares similar\ntemperature anisotropy and helium abundance properties with regular slow solar\nwinds, and they thus should have multiple origins.",

Self-replication would potentially allow for an exponential\nincrease in the number of probes and thereby drastically improve the efficiency\nof space exploration. Despite this potential, an integrated assessment of\nself-replicating space probes has not been presented since the 1980s, and it is\nstill unclear how far they are feasible. In this paper, we propose a concept\nfor a partially self-replicating probe for space exploration based on current\nand near-term technologies, with a focus on small spacecraft. The purpose is to\nchart a path towards self-replication with near-term benefits, rather than\nattempting full self-replication. For this reason, components such as\nmicrochips and other microelectronic components are brought with the initial\nprobe and are not replicated. We estimate that such a probe would be capable of\nreplicating 70% of its mass. To further increase this percentage, we identify\ntechnology gaps that are promising to address. We conclude that small-scale,\npartially self-replicating probes are feasible near-term. Their benefits would\nplay out in exploration missions requiring roughly more than a dozen of probes.",

A comprehensive determination of wave-properties requires\nmeasurements of both electric and magnetic fields. Here, we use full\ncapabilities of the PSP/FIELDS instrument suite to measure both the electric\nand magnetic components of circularly polarized waves. Comparing spacecraft\nframe magnetic field measurements with the Doppler-shifted cold-plasma\ndispersion relation for parallel transverse waves constrains allowable plasma\nframe polarizations and wave-vectors. We demonstrate that the Doppler-shifted\ncold-plasma dispersion has a maximum spacecraft frequency $f_{sc}^{*}$ for\nwhich intrinsically right-handed fast-magnetosonic waves (FMWs) propagating\nsunwards can appear left-handed in the spacecraft frame. Observations of\nleft-handed waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$ are uniquely explained by intrinsically\nleft-handed, ion-cyclotron, waves (ICWs). We demonstrate that electric field\nmeasurements for waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$ are consistent with ICWs\npropagating away from the sun, verifying the measured electric field. Applying\nthe verified electric field measurements to the full distribution of waves\nsuggests that, in the solar wind frame, the vast majority of waves propagate\naway from the sun, indicating that the observed population of coherent\nion-scale waves contains both intrinsically left and right hand polarized\nmodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In 1931/32, Schroedinger studied a hot gas Gedankenexperiment, an instance of\nlarge deviations of the empirical distribution and an early example of the\nso-called maximum entropy inference method. This so-called Schroedinger bridge\nproblem (SBP) was recently recognized as a regularization of the\nMonge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT), leading to effective\ncomputation of the latter. Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed\nas a zero-temperature limit of SBP, which amounts to minimization of the\nHelmholtz's free energy over probability distributions constrained to possess\ngiven marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a\ntemperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing\nthe entropy. These concepts are central to a rapidly expanding area of modern\nscience dealing with the so-called {\\em Sinkhorn algorithm} which appears as a\nspecial case of an algorithm first studied by the French analyst Robert Fortet\nin 1938/40 specifically for Schroedinger bridges. Due to the constraint on\nend-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack\nthese problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete\ncounterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation by iteratively solving\nthe so-called {\\em Schroedinger system}. In both the continuous as well as the\ndiscrete-time and space settings, {\\em stochastic control} provides a\nreformulation and dynamic versions of these problems. The formalism behind\nthese control problems have attracted attention as they lead to a variety of\nnew applications in spacecraft guidance, control of robot or biological swarms,\nsensing, active cooling, network routing as well as in computer and data\nscience. This multifacet and versatile framework, intertwining SBP and OMT,\nprovides the substrate for a historical and technical overview of the field\ntaken up in this paper.",

They are observed as (interplanetary) coronal mass ejections (ICMEs\nor CMEs) with coronal and heliospheric imagers. A fraction of them are observed\ninsitu as magnetic clouds (MCs). Fitting these structures properly with a model\nrequires a better understanding of their evolution. In situ measurements are\ndone locally when the spacecraft trajectory crosses the magnetic configuration.\nThese observations are taken for different elements of plasma and at different\ntimes, and are therefore biased by the expansion of the magnetic configuration.\nThis aging effect leads to stronger magnetic fields measured at the front than\nat the rear of MCs, an asymmetry often present in MC data. However, can the\nobserved asymmetry be explained quantitatively only from the expansion? Based\non self-similar expansion, we derive a method to estimate the expansion rate\nfrom observed plasma velocity. We next correct for the aging effect both the\nobserved magnetic field and the spatial coordinate along the spacecraft\ntrajectory. This provides corrected data as if the MC internal structure was\nobserved at the same time. We apply the method to 90 best observed MCs near\nEarth (1995-2012). The aging effect is the main source of the observed magnetic\nasymmetry only for 28\\% of MCs. After correcting the aging effect, the\nasymmetry is almost symmetrically distributed between MCs with a stronger\nmagnetic field at the front and those at the rear of MCs. The proposed method\ncan efficiently remove the aging bias within insitu data of MCs, and more\ngenerally of ICMEs. This allows one to analyse the data with a spatial\ncoordinate, such as in models or remote sensing observations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  World ships are hypothetical, large, self-contained spacecraft for crewed\ninterstellar travel, taking centuries to reach other stars. Due to their crewed\nnature, size, and long trip times, the feasibility of world ships faces an\nadditional set of challenges compared to interstellar probes. Despite their\nemergence in the 1980s, most of these topics remain unexplored. This article\nrevisits some of the key feasibility issues of world ships. First, definitions\nof world ships from the literature are revisited and the notion of world ship\npositioned with respect to similar concepts such as generation ships. Second,\nthe key question of population size is revisited in light of recent results\nfrom the literature. Third, socio-technical and economic feasibility issues are\nevaluated. Finally, world ships are compared to potential alternative modes of\ncrewed interstellar travel. Key roadblocks for world ships are the considerable\nresources required, shifting its economic feasibility beyond the year 2300, and\nthe development of a maintenance system capable of detecting, replacing, and\nrepairing several components per second. The emergence of alternative, less\ncostly modes of crewed interstellar travel at an earlier point in time might\nrender world ships obsolete.",

We compare the energy spectra of the\nanti-sunward propagating beam with that one of the backward scattered\npopulation and find that, on average, the backward scattered population shows a\nharder spectrum with the effect being stronger at higher energies. ii) We use a\nnumerical SEP transport model to simulate the effect of particle scattering\n(both in terms of pitch-angle and perpendicular to the mean field) on the\nspectrum. We find that pitch-angle scattering can lead to spectral changes at\nhigher energies (E $>100$ keV) and further away from the Sun (r $> 1$ au) which\nare also often observed. At lower energies, and closer to the Sun the effect of\npitch-angle scattering is much reduced so that the simulated energy spectra\nstill resemble the injected power-law functions. When examining pitch-angle\ndependent spectra, we find, in agreement with the observational results, that\nthe spectra of the backward propagating electrons are harder than that of the\nforward (from the Sun) propagating population. {We conclude that {\\it Solar\nOrbiter} and {\\it Parker Solar Probe} will be able to observe the unmodulated\nomni-directional SEP electron spectrum close to the Sun at higher energies,\ngiving a direct indication of the accelerated spectrum. }",

The\nthree-spacecraft constellation forms a nearly-equilateral triangle, which\nexperiences flexing along its orbit around the Sun. These time-varying and\nunequal armlengths require to process measurements with time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI) to synthesize virtual equal-arm interferometers, and\nreduce the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise. Algorithms compatible\nwith such TDI combinations have recently been proposed in order to suppress the\nphase fluctuations of the onboard ultra-stable oscillators (USO) used as\nreference clocks.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method to cancel USO noise in TDI\ncombinations. This method has comparable performance to existing algorithms,\nbut is more general as it can be applied to most TDI combinations found in the\nliterature. We compute analytical expressions for the residual clock noise\nbefore and after correction, accounting for the effect of time-varying beatnote\nfrequencies, previously neglected. We present results of numerical simulations\nthat are in agreement with our models, and show that clock noise can be\nsuppressed below required levels. The suppression algorithm introduces a new\nmodulation noise, for which we propose a partial mitigation. This modulation\nnoise remains the limiting effect for clock-noise suppression, setting strict\ntiming requirements on the sideband generation.",

Using the 2D improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the\nHeliosphere (iPATH) model, we model the large solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent of 10 September 2017 observed at Earth, Mars and STEREO-A. Based on\nobservational evidence,we assume that the CME-driven shock experienced a large\nlateral expansion shortly after the eruption, which is modelled by a double\nGaussian velocity profile in this simulation. We use the in-situ shock arrival\ntimes and the observed CME speeds at multiple spacecraft near Earth and Mars as\nconstraints to adjust the input model parameters. The modelled time intensity\nprofiles and fluence for energetic protons are then compared with observations.\nReasonable agreements with observations at Mars and STEREO-A are found. The\nsimulated results at Earth differ from observations of GOES-15. Instead, the\nsimulated results at a heliocentric longitude 20 degree west to Earth fit\nreasonably well with the GOES observation. This can be explained if the\npre-event solar wind magnetic field at Earth is not described by a nominal\nParker field. Our results suggest that a large lateral expansion of the\nCME-driven shock and a distorted interplanetary magnetic field due to previous\nevents can be important in understanding this GLE event.",

This estimate was based on an\nanalysis using a combination of all measured odd gravity harmonics $J_{3}$,\n$J_{5}$, $J_{7}$, and $J_{9}$, but the wind profile dependence on each of them\nseparately has not been investigated. Furthermore, these calculations assumed\nthe meridional profile of the cloud-level wind extends to depth. However, it is\npossible that the interior jet profile varies from that of the cloud-level as\nhinted by the Juno microwave measurement that find a smoother nadir brightness\ntemperature profile at depth compared to the cloud-level. Here we analyze in\ndetail the possible meridional and vertical structure of Jupiter's deep\njet-streams. We find that each odd gravity harmonic constrains the flow at a\ndifferent depth, with $J_{3}$ being the most dominant at depths below $3000$\nkm, $J_{5}$ being the most restrictive overall, and $J_{9}$ not constraining\nthe flow at all if the other odd harmonics are within the measurement range.\nInterior flow profiles constructed from perturbations to the cloud-level winds\nallow a more extensive range of vertical wind profiles, yet when the profiles\ndiffer substantially from the cloud-level, the ability to match the gravity\ndata reduces significantly. Overall, we find that while interior wind profiles\nthat do not resemble the cloud-level are possible, they are statistically\nunlikely. However, slightly smoother profiles, which resemble the Juno's\nmicrowave radiometer temperature profile at depth, are still compatible with\nthe gravity measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  White-light images from Heliospheric Imager-1 (HI1) onboard the Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) provide 2-dimensional (2D) global\nviews of solar wind transients traveling in the inner heliosphere from two\nperspectives. How to retrieve the hidden three-dimensional (3D) features of the\ntransients from these 2D images is intriguing but challenging. In our previous\nwork (Li et al., 2018), a 'correlation-aided' method is developed to recognize\nthe solar wind transients propagating along the Sun-Earth line based on\nsimultaneous HI1 images from two STEREO spacecraft. Here the method is extended\nfrom the Sun-Earth line to the whole 3D space to reconstruct the solar wind\ntransients in the common field of view of STEREO HI1 cameras. We demonstrate\nthe capability of the method by showing the 3D shapes and propagation\ndirections of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and three small-scale blobs during\n3-4 April 2010. Comparing with some forward modeling methods, we found our\nmethod reliable in terms of the position, angular width and propagation\ndirection. Based on our 3D reconstruction result, an angular distorted, nearly\nNorth-South oriented CME on 3 April 2010 is revealed, manifesting the\ncomplexity of a CME's 3D structure.",

Recently, the use of a sub-relativistic spacecraft\nwas proposed to indirectly probe Planet 9's gravitational influence. Here we\nstudy the effects of the drag and electromagnetic forces exerted on a\nsub-relativistic spacecraft by the interstellar medium (ISM) and compare these\nforces with the gravitational force induced by Planet 9. We find that the\nresulting noise due to density and magnetic fluctuations would dominate over\nPlanet 9's gravitational signal at sub-relativistic speeds, $v\\gtrsim 0.001~c$.\nWe then identify the parameter space required to overcome the drag and magnetic\nnoise from the ISM turbulence and enable the detection of Planet 9's gravity.\nFinally, we discuss practical strategies to mitigate the effect of the drag and\nelectromagnetic forces.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  As the solar wind propagates through the heliosphere, dynamical processes\nirreversibly erase the signatures of the near-Sun heating and acceleration\nprocesses. The elemental fractionation of the solar wind should not change\nduring transit however, making it an ideal tracer of these processes. We aimed\nto verify directly if the solar wind elemental fractionation is reflective of\nthe coronal source region fractionation, both within and across different solar\nwind source regions. A backmapping scheme was used to predict where solar wind\nmeasured by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) originated in the corona.\nThe coronal composition measured by the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) at the source regions was then compared with the in-situ\nsolar wind composition. On hourly timescales there was no apparent correlation\nbetween coronal and solar wind composition. In contrast, the distribution of\nfractionation values within individual source regions was similar in both the\ncorona and solar wind, but distributions between different sources have\nsignificant overlap. The matching distributions directly verifies that\nelemental composition is conserved as the plasma travels from the corona to the\nsolar wind, further validating it as a tracer of heating and acceleration\nprocesses. The overlap of fractionation values between sources means it is not\npossible to identify solar wind source regions solely by comparing solar wind\nand coronal composition measurements, but a comparison can be used to verify\nconsistency with predicted spacecraft-corona connections.",

The current study is particularly useful for\nsmall private launching companies with limited access to global observations\naround the Earth and/or for orbital maneuvers around other planets for which\nthe orbital observations are limited to the in situ equipment. An appropriate\ncost function is introduced for the sake of minimizing the total\ncontrol/impulse effort as well as the orbital uncertainty. It is subsequently\nproved that for a circle-to-circle maneuver, the optimization problem is\nquasi-convex with respect to the design variables. For near circular\ntrajectories the same cost function is minimized via a gradient based\noptimization algorithm in order to provide a sub-optimal solution that is\nefficient both with respect to energy effort and orbital uncertainty. As a\nrelevant case study, a four-impulse orbital maneuver between circular orbits\nunder Mars gravitation is simulated and analyzed to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Pathfinding in Euclidean space is a common problem faced in robotics and\ncomputer games. For long-distance navigation on the surface of the earth or in\nouter space however, approximating the geometry as Euclidean can be\ninsufficient for real-world applications such as the navigation of spacecraft,\naeroplanes, drones and ships. This article describes an any-angle pathfinding\nalgorithm for calculating the shortest path between point pairs over the\nsurface of a sphere. Introducing several novel adaptations, it is shown that\nAnya as described by (Harabor & Grastien, 2013) for Euclidean space can be\nextended to Spherical geometry. There, where the shortest-distance line between\ncoordinates is defined instead by a great-circle path, the optimal solution is\ntypically a curved line in Euclidean space. In addition the turning points for\noptimal paths in Spherical geometry are not necessarily corner points as they\nare in Euclidean space, as will be shown, making further substantial\nadaptations to Anya necessary. Spherical Anya returns the optimal path on the\nsphere, given these different properties of world maps defined in Spherical\ngeometry. It preserves all primary benefits of Anya in Euclidean geometry,\nnamely the Spherical Anya algorithm always returns an optimal path on a sphere\nand does so entirely on-line, without any preprocessing or large memory\noverheads. Performance benchmarks are provided for several game maps including\nStarcraft and Warcraft III as well as for sea navigation on Earth using the\nNOAA bathymetric dataset. Always returning the shorter path compared with the\nEuclidean approximation yielded by Anya, Spherical Anya is shown to be faster\nthan Anya for the majority of sea routes and slower for Game Maps and Random\nMaps.",

We analyzed\n3,900s of data obtained shortly before closest approach to Pluto and detect\nairglow emissions from H I, N I, N II, N$_2$, and CO above the disk of Pluto.\nWe find Pluto's brightness at Lyman $\\alpha$ to be $29.3\\pm1.9$R, in good\nagreement with pre-encounter estimates. The detection of the N II multiplet at\n1085\u00c5 marks the first direct detection of ions in Pluto's atmosphere. We do\nnot detect any emissions from noble gasses and place a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of\n0.14 R on the brightness of the Ar I 1048\u00c5 line. We compare pre-encounter\nmodel predictions and predictions from our own airglow model, based on\natmospheric profiles derived from the solar occultation observed by New\nHorizons, to the observed brightness of Pluto's airglow. Although completely\nopaque at Lyman $\\alpha$, Pluto's atmosphere is optically thin at wavelengths\nlonger than 1425\u00c5. Consequently, a significant amount of solar FUV light\nreaches the surface, where it can participate in space weathering processes.\nFrom the brightness of sunlight reflected from Pluto, we find the surface has a\nreflectance factor (I/F) of 17% between 1400-1850\u00c5. We also report the\nfirst detection of an C$_3$ hydrocarbon molecule, methylacetylene, in\nabsorption, at a column density of ~5$\\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding\nto a column-integrated mixing ratio of $1.6\\times10^{-6}$.",

An explanation of the simulation results is proposed in the context of\na recent phenomenological MHD model introduced by Bourouaine and Perez 2019\n(BP19) when restricted to the strong turbulence regime. The model predicts that\nthe two-time power spectrum exhibits an universal, self-similar behavior that\nis solely determined by the probability distribution function of random\nvelocities in the energy-containing range.
