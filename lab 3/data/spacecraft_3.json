We\ninvestigate the dynamical transfer of Centaurs into the inner Solar System,\nfacilitated by mean motion resonances with Jupiter and Saturn. The recently\ndiscovered object, P/2019 LD2, will transition from the Centaur region to the\ninner Solar System in 2063. In order to contextualize LD2, we perform N-body\nsimulations of a population of Centaurs and JFCs. Objects between Jupiter and\nSaturn with Tisserand parameter $T_J\\sim$3 are transferred onto orbits with\nperihelia $q<4$au within the next 1000 years with notably high efficiency. Our\nsimulations show that there may be additional LD2-like objects transitioning\ninto the inner Solar System in the near-term future, all of which have low\n$\\Delta$V with respect to Jupiter. We calculate the distribution of orbital\nelements resulting from a single Jovian encounter and show that objects with\ninitial perihelia close to Jupiter are efficiently scattered to $q<4$au.\nMoreover, approximately $55\\%$ of the transitioning objects in our simulated\npopulation experience at least 1 Jovian encounter prior to reaching $q<4$au. We\ndemonstrate that a spacecraft stationed near Jupiter would be well-positioned\nto rendezvous, orbit match, and accompany LD2 into the inner Solar System,\nproviding an opportunity to observe the onset of intense activity in a pristine\ncomet $\\textit{in situ}$. Finally, we discuss the prospect of identifying\nadditional targets for similar measurements with forthcoming observational\nfacilities.",

Like waves on water, magnetopause surface waves are thought to\ntravel in the direction of the driving solar wind, hence a paradigm in global\nmagnetospheric dynamics of tailward propagation has been well-established. Here\nwe show through multi-spacecraft observations, global simulations, and analytic\ntheory that the lowest-frequency impulsively-excited magnetopause surface\nwaves, with standing structure along the terrestrial magnetic field, propagate\nagainst the flow outside the boundary. Across a wide local time range (09-15h)\nthe waves' Poynting flux exactly balances the flow's advective effect, leading\nto no net energy flux and thus stationary structure across the field also.\nFurther down the equatorial flanks, however, advection dominates hence the\nwaves travel downtail, seeding fluctuations at the resonant frequency which\nsubsequently grow in amplitude via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and couple\nto magnetospheric body waves. This global response, contrary to the accepted\nparadigm, has implications on radiation belt, ionospheric, and auroral dynamics\nand potential applications to other dynamical systems.",

At present, the main difficulties are\nrelated to the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic fields and\nthe lack of 3D in-situ measurements of the CME body in interplanetary space.\nNevertheless, the evolution of a CME magnetic structure can be followed using a\ncombination of multi-point remote-sensing observations and multi-spacecraft\nin-situ measurements as well as modelling. Accordingly, we present in this work\nthe analysis of two CMEs that erupted from the Sun on 28 April 2012. We follow\ntheir eruption and early evolution using remote-sensing data, finding\nindications of CME--CME interaction, and then analyse their interplanetary\ncounterpart(s) using in-situ measurements at Venus, Earth, and Saturn. We\nobserve a seemingly single flux rope at all locations, but find possible\nsignatures of interaction at Earth, where high-cadence plasma data are\navailable. Reconstructions of the in-situ flux ropes provide almost identical\nresults at Venus and Earth but show greater discrepancies at Saturn, suggesting\nthat the CME was highly distorted and/or that further interaction with nearby\nsolar wind structures took place before 10 AU. This work highlights the\ndifficulties in connecting structures from the Sun to the outer heliosphere and\ndemonstrates the importance of multi-spacecraft studies to achieve a deeper\nunderstanding of the magnetic configuration of CMEs.",

Prominences are maintained by the Lorentz force against the\ngravity, therefore reduction of the prominence mass due to the coronal rain may\ncause the change of the force balance and hence destabilisation of the\nstructures. We aim to study the observational evidence of the influence of\ncoronal rain on the stability of prominence and subsequent eruption of CMEs. We\nused the simultaneous observations from AIA/SDO and SECCHI/STEREO spacecrafts\nfrom different angles to follow the dynamics of prominence/filaments and to\nstudy the role of coronal rain in their destabilisation. Three different\nprominences/filaments observed during years 2011-2012 were analysed using\nobservations acquired by SDO and STEREO. In all three cases massive coronal\nrain from the prominence body led to the destabilisation of prominence and\nsubsequently to the eruption of CMEs. The upward rising of prominences\nconsisted in the slow and the fast rise phases. The coronal rain triggered the\ninitial slow rise of prominences, which led to the final instability (the fast\nrise phase) after 18-28 hours in all cases. The estimated mass flux carried by\ncoronal rain blobs showed that the prominences became unstable after 40 \\% of\nmass loss. We suggest that the initial slow rise phase was triggered by the\nmass loss of prominence due to massive coronal rain, while the fast rise phase,\ni.e. the consequent instability of prominences, was caused by the torus\ninstability and/or magnetic reconnection with overlying coronal field.\nTherefore, the coronal rain triggered the instability of prominences and\nconsequent CMEs. If this is the case, then the coronal rain can be used to\npredict the CMEs and hence to improve the space weather predictions.",

From meteor magnitude data we have estimated the mass\ndistribution of meteoroids from different cometary streams by using the\nrelation between the luminosity and the mass obtained by Verniani (1973). These\nmass distributions are in the range observed for dust particles released from\ncomets 1P/Halley and 81P/Wild 2 as measured from spacecraft. From the derived\nmass distributions, we have integrated the incoming mass for the most\nsignificant meteor showers.

The largest examples of\nfluffy particles are clusters of IDPs no larger than 100 micrometers in size\n(or 5x10^-7 g in mass) while the largest cometary meteoroids are\ncentimeter-sized objects. Such gaps can be explained by the fragmentation in\nthe interstellar medium or in the atmosphere of the original cometary\nparticles. As an application of the mass distribution computations we describe\nthe significance of the disruption of fragile comets in close approaches to\nEarth as a more efficient (and probably more frequent) way to deliver volatiles\nthan direct impacts.

Van Staden & Antoniadis have\nobserved this object and reported a lack of synchronism, opposite to that\nrequired by the Hut's theory to account for the observed $\\dot{P}_{orb}$.\nMotivated by this discrepancy, we analyse photometric data obtained by the\nspacecraft Kepler second mission K2, with the purpose of identifying the\nperiods present in PSR J1723-2837. We notice several periods close to those of\nthe orbit and the rotation. The obtained periods pattern reveals the presence\nof a more complex phenomenology, which would not be well described in the frame\nof the weak friction model of equilibrium tides.",

Our analysis shows that the transition\nfrom ACR-dominated spectrum to GCR-dominated spectrum occurs at energies\n$\\sim$15 to $\\sim$35 MeV nuc$^{-1}$, and the transition energy $E_t$ is found\nto be well anticorrelated with varying solar activity. This is the first study\nof ACR-GCR transition energy dependence on the solar cycle variation. At\nenergies below $E_t$, the index of the power-law ACR-dominated spectrum\n($\\gamma_1$) ranges from -2.0 to -0.5, whereas the GCR-dominated spectrum has a\npower-law index ($\\gamma_2$) changing from 0.3 to 0.8 at energies ranging from\n$E_t$ to 237.9 MeV nuc$^{-1}$. Both $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are positively\ncorrelated with solar activity. In addition, during the solar cycle 24/25\nminimum period, the peak GCR intensity observed by ACE spacecraft is about 8\\%\nabove its 2009 value, setting a new record since the space age, while the peak\nACR intensity is almost similar to that of the previous two solar cycles with\nthe same pattern of solar magnetic polarity, indicating a different modulation\nmechanism between ACRs and GCRs.",

At least 6\nreconnecting current sheets with associated multiple proton populations and\nbeams, including a case of magnetic reconnection at a switchback boundary, are\nfound during this day. This represents 2% of the measured distribution\nfunctions. We discuss how this proportion may be underestimated, and how it may\ndepend on solar wind type and distance from the Sun. Conclusions. Although\nsuggesting a likely small contribution, but which remains to be quantitatively\nassessed, Solar Orbiter observations show that magnetic reconnection must be\nconsidered as one of the mechanisms that produce multiple proton populations\nand beams locally in the solar wind.",

The study is based on multi-wavelength and dual-perspective imaging\nobservations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory Ahead spacecraft, which can well reveal the structure and\nevolution of the two MFRs. We find that both of the MFRs show up in multiple\npassbands and their emissions mainly consist of a cold component peaking at a\ntemperature of $\\sim$0.4--0.6 MK and a hot component peaking at $\\sim$7--8 MK.\nThe two MFRs exhibit erupting, expanding, and untwisting motions that manifest\ndistinctive features from two different viewpoints. Their evolution can be\ndivided into two stages, a fast-eruption stage with speeds of about 105--125 km\ns$^{-1}$ for MFR-1 and 50--65 km s$^{-1}$ for MFR-2 and a slow-expansion (or\nuntwisting) stage with speeds of about 10--35 km s$^{-1}$ for MFR-1 and 10--30\nkm s$^{-1}$ for MFR-2 in the plane of sky. We also find that during the\ntwo-stage evolution, the high temperature features mainly appear in the\ninterface region between MFRs and ambient magnetic structures and also in the\ncenter of MFRs, which suggests that some heating processes take place in such\nplaces like magnetic reconnection and plasma compression. These observational\nresults indicate that the eruption and untwisting processes of MFRs are coupled\nwith the heating process, among which an energy conversion exists.",

In particular, plasma\ncomposition measurements in and around the footpoints of hot, coronal loops in\nthe core of the active region were able to explain the values later measured\nin-situ by the Wind spacecraft. Due to important differences in elemental\ncomposition between SEPs and the solar wind, the magnitude of the Si/S\nelemental abundance ratio emerged as a key diagnostic of SEP seed population\nand solar wind source locations. We seek to understand if the results are\ntypical of other active regions, even if they are not solar wind sources or SEP\nproductive. In this paper, we use a novel composition analysis technique,\ntogether with an evolutionary magnetic field model, in a new approach to\ninvestigate a typical solar active region (AR 11150), and identify the\nlocations of highly fractionated (high Si/S abundance ratio) plasma. Material\nconfined near the footpoints of coronal loops, as in AR 11944, that in this\ncase have expanded to the AR periphery, show the signature, and can be released\nfrom magnetic field opened by reconnection at the AR boundary. Since the\nfundamental characteristics of closed field loops being opened at the AR\nboundary is typical of active regions, this process is likely to be general.",

We\ntook advantage of the recent corrected VIR visible data to map the radiance\nfactor at 550 nm, three color composites, two spectral slopes, and a band area\nparameter relative to the 930 nm crystal field signature in pyroxene. Using the\nhowardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites data as a reference, we derived\nthe lithology of Vesta using the variations of the 930 nm and 506 nm\n(spin-forbidden) band centers observed in the VIR dataset. Our spectral\nparameters highlight a significant spectral diversity at the surface of Vesta.\nThis diversity is mainly evidenced by impact craters and illustrates the\nheterogeneous subsurface and upper crust of Vesta. Impact craters also\nparticipate directly in this spectral diversity by bringing dark exogenous\nmaterial to an almost entire hemisphere. Our derived lithology agrees with\nprevious results obtained using a combination of infrared and visible data. We\ntherefore demonstrate that it is possible to obtain crucial mineralogical\ninformation from visible wavelengths alone. In addition to the 506 nm band, we\nidentified the 550 nm spin-forbidden one. As reported by a laboratory study for\nsynthetic pyroxenes, we also do not observe any shift of the band center of\nthis feature across the surface of Vesta, and thus across different\nmineralogies, preventing use of the 550 nm spin-forbidden band for the\nlithology derivation.

We used space\nobservations from the Thermal Noise Receiver (TNR) and the High Frequency\nReceiver (HFR) to perform the calibration of the RPW dipole antenna system.\nObservations of type III bursts by the Wind spacecraft are used to obtain a\nreference radio flux density for cross-calibrating the RPW dipole antennas. The\nanalysis of a large sample of HFR observations (over about ten months), carried\nout jointly with an analysis of TNR-HFR data and prior to the antennas'\ndeployment, allowed us to estimate the reference system noise of the TNR-HFR\nreceivers. We obtained the effective length of the RPW dipoles and the\nreference system noise of TNR-HFR in space, where the antennas and\npre-amplifiers are embedded in the solar wind plasma. The obtained $l_{eff}$\nvalues are in agreement with the simulation and measurements performed on the\nground. By investigating the radio flux intensities of 35 type III bursts\nsimultaneously observed by Solar Orbiter and Wind, we found that while the\nscaling of the decay time as a function of the frequency is the same for the\nWaves and RPW instruments, their median values are higher for the former. This\nprovides the first observational evidence that Type III radio waves still\nundergo density scattering, even when they propagate from the source, in a\nmedium with a plasma frequency that is well below their own emission frequency.",

The filament height is fitted with the sum of a linear and\nexponential function. These two phases point to different physical mechanisms\nsuch as: tether-cutting reconnection and a magnetic instability. While no X-ray\nemission is reported, this event presents the classical eruption features like:\nseparation of double ribbons and the growth of flare loops. We report the\nmigration of the southern foot of the erupting filament flux rope due to the\ninterchange reconnection with encountered magnetic loops of a neighbouring AR.\nParallel to the erupting filament, a stable filament remains in the core of\nactive region. The specificity of this eruption is that coronal loops, located\nabove the nearly joining ends of the two filaments, first contract in phase,\nthen expand and reach a new stable configuration close to the one present at\nthe eruption onset. Both contraction and expansion phases last around 20 min.\nThe main difference with previous cases is that the PIL bent about 180 deg\naround the end of the erupting filament because the magnetic configuration is\nat least tri-polar. These observations are challenging for models which\ninterpreted previous cases of loop contraction within a bipolar configuration.\nNew simulations are required to broaden the complexity of the configurations\nstudied.",

The presence of disturbances prevents convergence to a unique\ndocking state, so in our formulation, docking is defined as occurring within a\nset constructed using prescribed tolerances. Safety is ensured via application\nof Robust Control Barrier Functions to render a designated safe set forward\ninvariant for any allowable disturbance. However, this safety strategy\nnecessarily presumes a worst-case disturbance, and thus restricts trajectories\nto a subset of the safe set when a worst-case disturbance is not present. The\npresented controller accounts for this restriction, and guarantees that the\nspacecraft both remains safe and achieves docking in finite time for any\nallowable disturbance. The controller is then validated in simulation for a\nspacecraft landing on an asteroid, and two spacecraft docking in low Earth\norbit.",

OSPREI includes ensemble\nmodeling by varying each input parameter to probe any uncertainty in their\nvalues, yielding probabilities for all outputs.

Following completion of sample collection in October 2020,\notherwise known as Touch-And-Go (TAG), the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was set to\nverify its collected sample mass requirement (> 60g of material). The\nthoroughly tested Sample Mass Measurement (SMM) method was to be used for this\nverification.

Once the sample was safely stowed in the return capsule an\nalternative SMM method was proposed. The alternative SMM technique utilized\nreaction wheel momentum data from identical TAGSAM movements prior to and\nfollowing the TAG event to estimate changes in spacecraft moment of inertia.\nConservation of momentum was used to isolate the sample mass from this inertia\nchange. Using this new method, the spacecraft team was able to successfully\nestimate collected sample mass to be 250.37 +/- 101 g.",

We estimate its source region with the aid of off-limb\nobservations from a secondary viewpoint and photospheric magnetic field\nextrapolations.

Here, we study 19 events during 2007--2014 associated\nwith twin-CME eruptions but without large SEP observations at L1 point. We\ncombine remote-sensing and in situ observations from multiple spacecraft to\ninvestigate the role of magnetic connectivity in SEP detection and the CME\ninformation in 3-dimensional (3D) space. We study one-on-one correlations of\nthe priCME 3D speed, flare intensity, suprathermal backgrounds, and height of\nCME-CME interaction with the SEP intensity. Among these, the priCME speed is\nfound to correlate with the SEP peak intensity at the highest level. We use the\nprojection correlation method to analyze the correlations between combinations\nof these multiple independent factors and the SEP peak intensity. We find that\nthe only combination of two or more parameters that has higher correlation with\nthe SEP peak intensity than the CME speed is the CME speed combined with the\npropagation direction. This further supports the dominant role of the priCME in\ncontrolling the SEP enhancements, and emphasizes the consideration of the\nlatitudinal effect. Overall, the magnetic connectivity in longitude as well as\nlatitude and the relatively lower priCME speed may explain the existence of the\ntwin-CME SEP-poor events. The role of the barrier effect of preCME(s) is\ndiscussed for an event on 2013 October 28.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The 3D fine structure of the solar atmosphere is still not fully understood\nas most of the available observations are taken from a single vantage point.\nThe goal of the paper is to study the 3D distribution of small-scale\nbrightening events (\"campfires\") discovered in the EUV quiet Sun by the Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager (EUI) aboard Solar Orbiter. We used a first commissioning\ndata set acquired by the EUI's High Resolution EUV telescope on 30 May 2020 in\nthe 174 \u00c5 passband and we combined it with simultaneous data taken by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory in a\nsimilar 171 \u00c5 passband. The two-pixel spatial resolution of the two\ntelescopes is 400 km and 880 km, respectively, which is sufficient to identify\nthe campfires in both data sets. The two spacecraft had an angular separation\nof around 31.5 degrees (essentially in heliographic longitude), which allowed\nfor the 3D reconstruction of the campfire position. These observations\nrepresent the first time that stereoscopy was achieved for brightenings at such\na small scale. Manual and automatic triangulation methods were used to\ncharacterize the campfire data. The height of the campfires is located between\n1000 km and 5000 km above the photosphere and we find a good agreement between\nthe manual and automatic methods. The internal structure of campfires is mostly\nunresolved by AIA; however, for a particularly large campfire, we were able to\ntriangulate a few pixels, which are all in a narrow range between 2500 and 4500\nkm. The low height of EUI campfires suggests that they belong to the previously\nunresolved fine structure of the transition region and low corona of the quiet\nSun. They are probably apexes of small-scale dynamic loops heated internally to\ncoronal temperatures. This work demonstrates that high-resolution stereoscopy\nof structures in the solar atmosphere has become feasible.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Using the multi-band imager MapCam onboard the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral\nInterpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer)\nspacecraft, we identified 77 instances of proposed exogenic materials\ndistributed globally on the surface of the B-type asteroid (101955) Bennu. We\nidentified materials as exogenic on the basis of an absorption near 1 um that\nis indicative of anhydrous silicates. The exogenic materials are spatially\nresolved by the telescopic camera PolyCam. All such materials are brighter than\ntheir surroundings, and they are expressed in a variety of morphologies:\nhomogeneous, breccia-like, inclusion-like, and others. Inclusion-like features\nare the most common. Visible spectrophotometry was obtained for 46 of the 77\nlocations from MapCam images. Principal component analysis indicates at least\ntwo trends: (i) mixing of Bennu's average spectrum with a strong 1-um band\nabsorption, possibly from pyroxene-rich material, and (ii) mixing with a weak\n1-um band absorption. The endmember with a strong 1-um feature is consistent\nwith Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite (HED) meteorites, whereas the one showing a\nweak 1-um feature may be consistent with HEDs, ordinary chondrites, or\ncarbonaceous chondrites. The variation in the few available near-infrared\nreflectance spectra strongly suggests varying compositions among the exogenic\nmaterials. Thus, Bennu might record the remnants of multiple impacts with\ndifferent compositions to its parent body, which could have happened in the\nvery early history of the Solar System. Moreover, at least one of the exogenic\nobjects is compositionally different from the exogenic materials found on the\nsimilar asteroid (162173) Ryugu, and they suggest different impact tracks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  One of the striking observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft\nis the prevalence in the inner heliosphere of large amplitude, Alfv\u00e9nic\nmagnetic field reversals termed 'switchbacks'. These $\\delta B_R/B \\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(1$) fluctuations occur on a range of timescales and in {\\em\npatches} separated by intervals of quiet, radial magnetic field. We use\nmeasurements from PSP to demonstrate that patches of switchbacks are localized\nwithin the extensions of plasma structures originating at the base of the\ncorona. These structures are characterized by an increase in alpha particle\nabundance, Mach number, plasma $\\beta$ and pressure, and by depletions in the\nmagnetic field magnitude and electron temperature. These intervals are in\npressure-balance, implying stationary spatial structure, and the field\ndepressions are consistent with overexpanded flux tubes. The structures are\nasymmetric in Carrington longitude with a steeper leading edge and a small\n($\\sim$1$^\\circ$) edge of hotter plasma and enhanced magnetic field\nfluctuations. Some structures contain suprathermal ions to $\\sim$85 keV that we\nargue are the energetic tail of the solar wind alpha population. The structures\nare separated in longitude by angular scales associated with supergranulation.\nThis suggests that these switchbacks originate near the leading edge of the\ndiverging magnetic field funnels associated with the network magnetic field -\nthe primary wind sources. We propose an origin of the magnetic field\nswitchbacks, hot plasma and suprathermals, alpha particles in interchange\nreconnection events just above the solar transition region and our measurements\nrepresent the extended regions of a turbulent outflow exhaust.",

Our algorithm solves\nthe PDG problem by framing it as an $\\mathcal{L}^1$ SOC problem for minimum\nfuel consumption. Additionally, it can handle practically useful control\nconstraints, nonlinear dynamics and enforces state constraints as\nsoft-constraints. This is achieved by building off of recent work on deep\nForward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) and differentiable\nnon-convex optimization neural-network layers based on stochastic search. In\ncontrast to previous approaches, our algorithm does not require convexification\nof the constraints or linearization of the dynamics and is empirically shown to\nbe robust to stochastic disturbances and the initial position of the\nspacecraft. After training offline, our controller can be activated once the\nspacecraft is within a pre-specified radius of the landing zone and at a\npre-specified altitude i.e., the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the\nlanding zone. We demonstrate empirically that our controller can successfully\nand safely land all trajectories initialized at the base of this cone while\nminimizing fuel consumption.",

We looked for new HMXBs in the eROSITA data,\nsearched for pulsations in HMXB candidates and investigated the long-term\nbehaviour of the full sample using archival X-ray and optical data. For sources\nsufficiently bright, a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of their eROSITA\ndata was performed. A source detection analysis of the eROSITA images in\ndifferent energy bands provided count rates and upper limits for the remaining\nsources. We report the discovery of a new Be/X-ray binary in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. The transient SRGEt J052829.5-690345 was detected with a\n0.2-8.0 keV luminosity of ~10^35 erg/s and exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum,\ntypical for this class of HMXBs. The OGLE I-band light curve of the V~15.7 mag\ncounterpart shows large variations by up to 0.75 mag, which occur quasi\nperiodically with ~511 days. The eROSITA observations of the Small Magellanic\nCloud covered 16 Be/X-ray binary pulsars, five of them were bright enough to\naccurately determine their current pulse period. The pulse periods for SXP 726\nand SXP 1323 measured from eROSITA data are ~800 s and ~1006 s, respectively,\nfar away from their discovery periods. Including archival XMM-Newton\nobservations we update the spin-period history of the two long-period pulsars\nwhich show nearly linear trends in their period evolution since more than 15\nyears. The corresponding average spin-down rate for SXP 726 is 4.3 s/yr while\nSXP 1323 shows spin-up with a rate of -23.2 s/yr.
