    "abstract": "Abstract:  In recent years the number of CubeSats (U-class spacecrafts) launched into\nspace has increased exponentially marking the dawn of the nanosatellite\ntechnology. In general these satellites have a much smaller mass budget\ncompared to conventional scientific satellites which limits shielding of\nscientific instruments against direct and indirect radiation in space. In this\npaper we present a simulation framework to quantify the signal in large\nfield-of-view gamma-ray scintillation detectors of satellites induced by\nX-ray/gamma-ray transients, by taking into account the response of the\ndetector. Furthermore, we quantify the signal induced by X-ray and particle\nbackground sources at a Low-Earth Orbit outside South Atlantic Anomaly and\npolar regions. Finally, we calculate the signal-to-noise ratio taking into\naccount different energy threshold levels. Our simulation can be used to\noptimize material composition and predict detectability of various\nastrophysical sources by CubeSats. We apply the developed simulation to a\nsatellite belonging to a planned CAMELOT CubeSat constellation. This project\nmainly aims to detect short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as a secondary\nscience objective, to detect soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and terrestrial\ngamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The simulation includes a detailed computer-aided\ndesign (CAD) model of the satellite to take into account the interaction of\nparticles with the material of the satellite as accurately as possible. Results\nof our simulations predict that CubeSats can complement the large space\nobservatories in high-energy astrophysics for observations of GRBs, SGRs and\nTGFs. For the detectors planned to be on board of the CAMELOT CubeSats the\nsimulations show that detections with signal-to-noise ratio of at least 9 for\nmedian GRB and SGR fluxes are achievable.",

Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge\nof the CME properties in the inner heliosphere remains constrained by the\nscarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore, most CMEs\nare observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to\ncomplement the sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of\nthe linear force-free spheromak CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial\nevolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context for observational\nstudies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution by\nplacing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain.\nTo directly compare observational and modelling results, we characterise the\ninterplanetary CME signatures between 0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series,\nexploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse real in situ data.\nResults show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME\nvalues is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME\nexpands as a consequence of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the\nexpansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate at larger distances. The early\nrapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size in our\nsimulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak\ngeometry used. The magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME\nduring propagation, while ageing is most probably not a substantial source of\nmagnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that is\nsignificantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA\nprovides a consistent description of the radial evolution of solar wind and\nCMEs; nevertheless, improvements are required to better reproduce the CME\nradial extension.",

We compare\nexisting catalogs for both heliospheric distances and arrive at a clean dataset\nfor the identical time range. This allows a well-sampled statistical analysis\nand for the opposition phases of the planets an in-depth analysis of SIRs as\nthey evolve with distance. We use in-situ solar wind data from OMNI and the\nMAVEN spacecraft as well as remote sensing data from SDO. A superposed epoch\nanalysis is performed for bulk speed, proton density, temperature, magnetic\nfield magnitude and total perpendicular pressure. Additionally, a study of\nevents during the two opposition phases of Earth and Mars in the years 2016 and\n2018 is conducted. SIR related coronal holes with their area as well as their\nlatitudinal and longitudinal extent are extracted and correlated to the maximum\nbulk speed and duration of the corresponding high speed solar wind streams\nfollowing the stream interaction regions. We find that while the entire solar\nwind HSS shows no expansion as it evolves from Earth to Mars, the crest of the\nHSS profile broadens by about 17%, and the magnetic field and total pressure by\nabout 45% around the stream interface. The difference between the maximum and\nminimum values in the normalized superposed profiles increases slightly or\nstagnates from 1-1.5 AU for all parameters, except for the temperature. A sharp\ndrop at zero epoch time is observed in the superposed profiles for the magnetic\nfield strength at both heliospheric distances. Maximum solar wind speed has a\nstronger dependence on the latitudinal extent of the respective coronal hole\nthan on its longitudinal extent.

We find that all in-situ locations detect signatures of an SEP\nevent, which we trace back to the May 17 eruption.

A rapidly\nrising number of spacecraft and increasingly complex scientific instruments\nwith higher bandwidth requirements have resulted in demand that exceeds the\nnetwork's capacity across its 12 antennae. The existing DSN scheduling process\noperates on a rolling weekly basis and is time-consuming; for a given week,\ngeneration of the final baseline schedule of spacecraft tracking passes takes\nroughly 5 months from the initial requirements submission deadline, with\nseveral weeks of peer-to-peer negotiations in between. This paper proposes a\ndeep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to generate candidate DSN schedules\nfrom mission requests and spacecraft ephemeris data with demonstrated\ncapability to address real-world operational constraints. A deep RL agent is\ndeveloped that takes mission requests for a given week as input, and interacts\nwith a DSN scheduling environment to allocate tracks such that its reward\nsignal is maximized. A comparison is made between an agent trained using\nProximal Policy Optimization and its random, untrained counterpart. The results\nrepresent a proof-of-concept that, given a well-shaped reward signal, a deep RL\nagent can learn the complex heuristics used by experts to schedule the DSN. A\ntrained agent can potentially be used to generate candidate schedules to\nbootstrap the scheduling process and thus reduce the turnaround cycle for DSN\nscheduling.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  As fundamental parameters of the Sun, the Alfv\u00e9n radius and angular\nmomentum loss determine how the solar wind changes from sub-Alfv\u00e9nic to\nsuper-Alfv\u00e9nic and how the Sun spins down. We present an approach to\ndetermining the solar wind angular momentum flux based on observations from\nParker Solar Probe (PSP). A flux of about $0.15\\times10^{30}$ dyn cm sr$^{-1}$\nnear the ecliptic plane and 0.7:1 partition of that flux between the particles\nand magnetic field are obtained by averaging data from the first four\nencounters within 0.3 au from the Sun. The angular momentum flux and its\nparticle component decrease with the solar wind speed, while the flux in the\nfield is remarkably constant. A speed dependence in the Alfv\u00e9n radius is also\nobserved, which suggests a \"rugged\" Alfv\u00e9n surface around the Sun.\nSubstantial diving below the Alfv\u00e9n surface seems plausible only for\nrelatively slow solar wind given the orbital design of PSP. Uncertainties are\nevaluated based on the acceleration profiles of the same solar wind streams\nobserved at PSP and a radially aligned spacecraft near 1 au. We illustrate that\nthe \"angular momentum paradox\" raised by R\u00e9ville et al. can be removed by\ntaking into account the contribution of the alpha particles. The large proton\ntransverse velocity observed by PSP is perhaps inherent in the solar wind\nacceleration process, where an opposite transverse velocity is produced for the\nalphas with the angular momentum conserved. Preliminary analysis of some\nrecovered alpha parameters tends to agree with the results.",

An interplanetary shock wave was driven in front of the ICME. We\nfocus on the transmission of the magnetic fluctuations across the shock and\nanalyze the characteristic wave modes of solar wind turbulence near the shock\nobserved by both spacecraft. The ICME event is characterized by a magnetic\nhelicity based technique. The shock normal is determined by magnetic\ncoplanarity method for Solar Orbiter and using a mixed coplanarity approach for\nWind. The power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations are generated by\napplying both a fast Fourier transform and Morlet wavelet analysis. To\nunderstand the nature of waves observed near the shock, we use the normalized\nmagnetic helicity as a diagnostic parameter. The wavelet reconstructed magnetic\nfield fluctuation hodograms are used to further study the polarization\nproperties of waves. We find that the ICME-driven shock observed by Solar\nOrbiter and Wind is a fast forward oblique shock with a more perpendicular\nshock angle at 1 AU. After the shock crossing, the magnetic field fluctuation\npower increases. Most of the magnetic field fluctuation power resides in the\ntransverse fluctuations. In the vicinity of the shock, both spacecraft observe\nright-hand polarized waves in the spacecraft frame. The upstream wave\nsignatures fall in a relatively broad and low-frequency band, which might be\nattributed to low-frequency MHD waves excited by the streaming particles. For\nthe downstream magnetic wave activity, we find oblique kinetic Alfven waves\nwith frequencies near the proton cyclotron frequency in the spacecraft frame.\nThe frequency of the downstream waves increases by a factor of 7-10 due to the\nshock compression and the Doppler effect.",

ICE was\noriginally the ISEE-3 satellite, designed for magnetospheric measurements near\nthe Earth, and was diverted via a lunar gravity assist to pass through the\nplasma tail of the comet. The comet has been observed by the all-sky hydrogen\nLyman-alpha Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) camera on the SOlar and Heliospheric\nObservatory satellite during its last four apparitions in 1998, 2005, 2012 and\n2018. This paper compares water production rates calculated from the hydrogen\nimages from the 1998 and 2005 results, published by Combi et al. (2011), with\nnew observations from 2012 and 2018. Unlike some comets that have faded over\ntime, except for 2 outbursts seen in the 2012 results, the activity levels for\nComet 21P have not changed consistently over time. A power-law fit to the\npre-perihelion water production rate vs. heliocentric distance for all four\napparitions gives a result of 3.75x10^28 x r^-0.28+/-0.4, and that for the\npost-perihelion production rate, discounting 2012 data dominated by outbursts,\ngives 4.15 x 10^28 x r^-10.2+/-0.9. The production rates are in s^-1 and\nheliocentric distances are in AU.",

We\nincorporated a simplified -- yet representative -- model of the whole human\ngenome with 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), containing 2110 building blocks that\nsimulate genetic elements (loci). Each individual is endowed with his/her own\ndiploid genome. Each locus can take 10 different allelic (mutated) forms that\ncan be investigated. To mimic gamete production (sperm and eggs) in human\nindividuals, we simulate the meiosis process including crossing-over and\nunilateral conversions of chromosomal sequences. Mutation of the genetic\ninformation from cosmic ray bombardments is also included. In this first paper\nof a series of two, we use the neutral hypothesis: mutations (genetic changes)\nhave only neutral phenotypic effects (physical manifestations), implying no\nnatural selection on variations. We will relax this assumption in the second\npaper. Under such hypothesis, we demonstrate how the genetic patrimony of\nmulti-generational crews can be affected by genetic drift and mutations. It\nappears that centuries-long deep space travels have small but unavoidable\neffects on the genetic composition/diversity of the traveling populations that\nherald substantial genetic differentiation on longer time-scales if the annual\nequivalent dose of cosmic ray radiation is similar to the Earth radioactivity\nbackground at sea level. For larger doses, genomes in the final populations can\ndeviate more strongly with significant genetic differentiation that arises\nwithin centuries.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The Kepler mission has provided a wealth of data, revealing new insights in\ntime-domain astronomy. However, Kepler's single band-pass has limited studies\nto a single wavelength. In this work we build a data-driven, pixel-level model\nfor the Pixel Response Function (PRF) of Kepler targets, modeling the image\ndata from the spacecraft. Our model is sufficiently flexible to capture known\ndetector effects, such as non-linearity, intra-pixel sensitivity variations,\nand focus change. In theory, the shape of the Kepler PRF should also be weakly\nwavelength dependent, due to optical chromatic aberration and wavelength\ndependent detector response functions. We are able to identify these predicted\nshape changes to the PRF using the residuals between Kepler data and our model.\nIn this work, we show that these PRF changes correspond to wavelength\nvariability in Kepler targets using a small sample of eclipsing binaries. Using\nour model, we demonstrate that pixel-level light curves of eclipsing binaries\nshow variable eclipse depths, ellipsoidal modulation and limb darkening. These\nchanges at the pixel level are consistent with multi-wavelength photometry. Our\nwork suggests each pixel in the Kepler data of a single target has a different\neffective wavelength, ranging from $\\approx$ 550-750 $nm$. In this proof of\nconcept, we demonstrate our model, and discuss possible use cases for the\nwavelength dependent Pixel Response Function of Kepler. These use cases include\ncharacterizing variable systems, and vetting exoplanet discoveries at the pixel\nlevel. The chromatic PRF of Kepler is due to weak wavelength dependence in the\noptical systems and detector of the telescope, and similar chromatic PRFs are\nexpected in other similar telescopes, notably the NASA TESS telescope.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control\nsystem. Following prior work, we study systems enduring a loss of control\nauthority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators\nproducing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time\nreadings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still\nreach a target after a loss of control authority. However, after a malfunction\na resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to\nits initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new\nconcept of quantitative resilience. We define this metric as the maximal ratio\nof the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and\nmalfunctioning systems. Na\u00efve computation of quantitative resilience directly\nfrom the definition is a time-consuming task as it requires solving four\nnested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical\ncontribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute\nquantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on three novel geometric\nresults we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear\noptimization problem. We illustrate our method on two numerical examples: an\nopinion dynamics scenario and a trajectory controller for low-thrust\nspacecrafts.",

We reproduce the previous finding that atmospheric models\nusing classic reflection laws (Lambertian, Rayleigh, single Henyey-Greenstein)\nprovide poor fits to the data. Using the double Henyey-Greenstein reflection\nlaw, we extract posterior distributions of the single-scattering albedo and\nscattering asymmetry factors and tabulate their median values and\nuncertainties. We infer that the aerosols in the Jovian atmosphere are large,\nirregular, polydisperse particles that produce strong forward scattering\ntogether with a narrow backscattering lobe. The near-unity values of the\nsingle-scattering albedos imply that multiple scattering of radiation is an\nimportant effect. We speculate that the observed narrow backscattering lobe is\ncaused by coherent backscattering of radiation, which is usually associated\nwith Solar System bodies with solid surfaces and regolith. Our findings\ndemonstrate that precise, multi-wavelength phase curves encode valuable\ninformation on the fundamental properties of cloud/haze particles.

While a semblance of\nconsensus exists regarding the scaling in the MHD and dispersive ranges, the\nprecise scaling in the transition range and the actual physical mechanisms that\ncontrol it remain open questions. Using the high-resolution data in the inner\nheliosphere from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission, we find that the sub-ion\nscales (i.e., at the frequency f ~ [2, 9] Hz) follow a power-law spectrum f^a\nwith a spectral index a varying between -3 and -5.7. Our results also show that\nthere is a trend toward and anti-correlation between the spectral slopes and\nthe power amplitudes at the MHD scales, in agreement with previous studies: the\nhigher the power amplitude the steeper the spectrum at sub-ion scales. A\nsimilar trend toward an anti-correlation between steep spectra and increasing\nnormalized cross helicity is found, in agreement with previous theoretical\npredictions about the imbalanced solar wind. We discuss the ubiquitous nature\nof the ion transition range in solar wind turbulence in the inner heliosphere.",

A pair of cubic test masses is hosted inside the LISA-Pathfinder\nspacecraft and shielded from any force other than the interplanetary\ngravitational field. The purity of the shielding gives the performance of the\nmission.\nThere are a number of aspects that had to be confirmed in-flight. One of them\nis the transition phase from the launch configuration, when the test masses are\nlocked, to the science free-falling configuration. Each test mass is initially\nreleased from the mechanical constraints via a dedicated mechanism and then\ncaptured by an electrostatic control system. In fact, each test mass is\nsurrounded by a set of electrodes for actuation and sensing purposes. The\nperformance criterion of the release is the final velocity of the test mass\nrelative to the spacecraft, with an upper threshold set to 5 $\\mu m/s$. The\nLISA-Pathfinder first in-flight release velocities highlighted an unexpected\ndynamics with large linear and angular velocities. The electrostatic control\nwas successful, but only relying on a manual procedure that cannot be\nconsidered as baseline for LISA.\nThis paper helps investigating the in-flight non-compliance by dealing with\nthe modeling of the electrostatic environment around each test mass and its\ncontribution to the release and capture dynamics. The electrostatic model is\nbased on the method of moments, a boundary element numerical technique suitable\nfor estimating forces and capacitances between conductors. We also provide a\nshort overview of the method, which can be used for the analysis of other\nphenomena within LISA and for the design of future gravitational waves\ntelescopes and space projects.",

We have\ninvestigated the properties of these functions for ions and electrons in\ndifferent magnetospheric regions, thereby making it possible to reveal the\n$\\kappa$-parameters for a wide range of plasma beta ($\\beta$) values (from\n$10^{-3}$ to $10^{2}$). This was done using simultaneous ion and electron\nmeasurements from the five Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions\nduring Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft spanning the years 2008 to 2018. It was\nfound that for a fixed plasma $\\beta$, the $\\kappa$-index and core energy\n($E_c$) of the distribution can be modeled by the power-law\n$\\kappa=AE_c^\\gamma$ for both species, and the relation between $\\beta$,\n$\\kappa$, and $E_c$ is much more complex than earlier reported: both $A$ and\n$\\gamma$ exhibit systematic dependencies with $\\beta$. Our results indicate\nthat $\\beta \\sim 0.1-0.3$ is a range where the plasma is more dynamic since it\nis influenced by both the magnetic field and temperature fluctuations, which\nsuggests that the transition between magnetically dominated plasmas to\nkinetically dominated plasmas occurs at these values of $\\beta$. For $\\beta > 1\n$, both $A$ and $\\gamma$ take nearly constant values, a feature that is\nespecially notable for the electrons and might be related to their\ndemagnetization. The relation between $\\beta$, $\\kappa$, and $E_c$ that we\npresent is an important result that can be used by theoretical models in the\nfuture.",

In\norder to satisfy this objective, water within the ice shell must also be\nidentified. Inductive electromagnetic (EM) methods are optimal for water\ndetection on Europa because even a small fraction of dissolved salts will make\nwater orders of magnitude more electrically conductive than the ice shell.\nCompared to induction studies by the Galileo spacecraft, measurements of\nhigher-frequency ambient EM fields are necessary to resolve the shallower\ndepths of intrashell water. Although these fields have been mostly\ncharacterized by prior missions, their unknown source structures and plasma\nproperties do not allow EM sounding using a single surface magnetometer or the\norbit-to-surface magnetic transfer function, respectively. Instead, broadband\nEM sounding can be accomplished from a single surface station using the\nmagnetotelluric (MT) method, which measures horizontal electric fields as well\nas the three-component magnetic field. We have developed a prototype Europa\nMagnetotelluric Sounder (EMS) to meet the measurement requirements in the\nrelevant thermal, vacuum, and radiation environment. EMS comprises central\nelectronics, a fluxgate magnetometer on a mast, and three ballistically\ndeployed electrodes to measure differences in surface electric potential. In\nthis paper, we describe EMS development and testing as well as providing\nsupporting information on the concept of operations and calculations on water\ndetectability. EMS can uniquely determine the occurrence of intrashell water on\nEuropa, providing important constraints on habitability.",

However, two key challenges currently pose a\nmajor barrier to the use of deep learning for vision-based on-orbit proximity\noperations. Firstly, efficient implementation of these techniques relies on an\neffective system for model development that streamlines data curation,\ntraining, and evaluation. Secondly, a scarcity of labeled training data (images\nof a target spacecraft) hinders creation of robust deep learning models. This\npaper presents an open-source deep learning pipeline, developed specifically\nfor on-orbit visual navigation applications, that addresses these challenges.\nThe core of our work consists of two custom software tools built on top of a\ncloud architecture that interconnects all stages of the model development\nprocess. The first tool leverages Blender, an open-source 3D graphics toolset,\nto generate labeled synthetic training data with configurable model poses\n(positions and orientations), lighting conditions, backgrounds, and commonly\nobserved in-space image aberrations. The second tool is a plugin-based\nframework for effective dataset curation and model training; it provides common\nfunctionality like metadata generation and remote storage access to all\nprojects while giving complete independence to project-specific code.\nTime-consuming, graphics-intensive processes such as synthetic image generation\nand model training run on cloud-based computational resources which scale to\nany scope and budget and allow development of even the largest datasets and\nmodels from any machine.

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Recently, we developed the Correlation-Aided Reconstruction (CORAR) method to\nreconstruct solar wind inhomogeneous structures, or transients, using dual-view\nwhite-light images (Li et al. 2020; Li et al. 2018). This method is proved to\nbe useful for studying the morphological and dynamical properties of transients\nlike blobs and coronal mass ejection (CME), but the accuracy of reconstruction\nmay be affected by the separation angle between the two spacecraft (Lyu et al.\n2020). Based on the dual-view CME events from the Heliospheric Imager CME Join\nCatalogue (HIJoinCAT) in the HELCATS (Heliospheric Cataloguing, Analysis and\nTechniques Service) project, we study the quality of the CME reconstruction by\nthe CORAR method under different STEREO stereoscopic angles. We find that when\nthe separation angle of spacecraft is around 150\u00b0, most CME events can be\nwell reconstructed. If the collinear effect is considered, the optimal\nseparation angle should locate between 120\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. Compared with\nthe CME direction given in the Heliospheric Imager Geometrical Catalogue\n(HIGeoCAT) from HELCATS, the CME parameters obtained by the CORAR method are\nreasonable. However, the CORAR-obtained directions have deviations towards the\nmeridian plane in longitude, and towards the equatorial plane in latitude. An\nempirical formula is proposed to correct these deviations. This study provides\nthe basis for the spacecraft configuration of our recently proposed Solar Ring\nmission concept (Wang et al. 2020b).",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Magnetic nulls are ubiquitous in space plasmas, and are of interest as sites\nof localized energy dissipation or magnetic reconnection. As such, a number of\nmethods have been proposed for detecting nulls in both simulation data and in\nsitu spacecraft data from Earth's magnetosphere. The same methods can be\napplied to detect stagnation points in flow fields. In this paper we describe a\nsystematic comparison of different methods for finding magnetic nulls. The\nPoincare index method, the first-order Taylor expansion (FOTE) method, and the\ntrilinear method are considered. We define a magnetic field containing fourteen\nmagnetic nulls whose positions and types are known to arbitrary precision.\nFurthermore, we applied the selected techniques in order to find and classify\nthose nulls. Two situations are considered: one in which the magnetic field is\ndiscretized on a rectangular grid, and the second in which the magnetic field\nis discretized along synthetic `spacecraft trajectories' within the domain. At\npresent, FOTE and trilinear are the most reliable methods for finding nulls in\nthe spacecraft data and in numerical simulations on Cartesian grids,\nrespectively. The Poincare index method is suitable for simulations on both\ntetrahedral and hexahedral meshes. The proposed magnetic field configuration\ncan be used for grading and benchmarking the new and existing tools for finding\nmagnetic nulls and flow stagnation points.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  In the past few years, the interest towards the implementation of\ndesign-for-demise measures has increased steadily. Most mid-sized satellites\ncurrently launched and already in orbit fail to comply with the casualty risk\nthreshold of 0.0001. Therefore, satellites manufacturers and mission operators\nneed to perform a disposal through a controlled re-entry, which has a higher\ncost and increased complexity. Through the design-for-demise paradigm, this\nadditional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly\ncompliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft\nsuch that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more\nvulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the\nmission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the\nsurvivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off\nsolutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise\nmeasures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris\nimpacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the\nauthors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary\ndesign solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the\nsurvivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design. In\nthis way, a more integrated design can be achieved. The present work focuses on\nthe improvement of the multi-objective optimisation framework by including\nconstraints. The paper shows the application of the constrained optimisation to\ntwo relevant examples: the optimisation of a tank assembly and the optimisation\nof a typical satellite configuration.",

In\nthis paper, we strive to tackle the challenges of developing ultra-high-rate\nWSNs based on 802.11 (WiFi) standard by proposing Sensifi. As an illustrative\napplication of this system, we consider vibration test monitoring of spacecraft\nand identify system design requirements and challenges. Our main contributions\nare as follows. First, we propose packet encoding methods to reduce the\noverhead of assigning accurate timestamps to samples. Second, we propose energy\nefficiency methods to enhance the system's lifetime. Third, we reduce the\noverhead of processing outgoing packets through network stack to enhance\nsampling rate and mitigate sampling rate instability. Fourth, we study and\nreduce the delay of processing incoming packets through network stack to\nenhance the accuracy of time synchronization among nodes. Fifth, we propose a\nlow-power node design for ultra-high-rate applications. Sixth, we use our node\ndesign to empirically evaluate the system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  The $\\textit{Kepler}$ satellite potentially provides the highest precision\nphotometry of active galactic nuclei (AGN) available to investigate\nshort-timescale optical variability. We targeted quasars from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey that lie in the fields of view of the $\\textit{Kepler/K2}$\ncampaigns. Based on those observations, we report the discovery and properties\nof a previously unidentified instrumental signature in K2. Systematic errors in\nK2, beyond those due to the motion of the detector, plague our AGN and other\nfaint-target, guest-observer science proposals. Weakly illuminated pixels are\ndominated by low frequency trends that are both non-astrophysical and\ncorrelated from object to object. A critical clue to understanding this\ninstrumental noise is that different targets observed in the same channels of\nCampaign 8 (rear facing) and Campaign 16 (forward facing) had nearly identical\nlight curves after time reversal of one of the campaigns. This observation\nstrongly suggests that the underlying problem relates to the relative\nSun-spacecraft-field orientation, which was approximately the same on day 1 of\nCampaign 8 as the last day of Campaign 16. Furthermore, we measure that the\ninstrumental signature lags in time as a function of radius from the center of\nthe detector, crossing channel boundaries. Systematics documented in this\ninvestigation are unlikely to be due to Moir\u00e9 noise, rolling band, or\npointing jitter. Instead this work strongly suggests temperature-dependent\nfocus changes that are further subject to channel variations. Further\ncharacterization of this signature is crucial for rehabilitating K2 data for\nuse in investigations of AGN light curves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:  Observations of Jupiter's deep atmosphere by the Juno spacecraft have\nrevealed several puzzling facts: The concentration of ammonia is variable down\nto pressures of tens of bars, and is strongly dependent on latitude. While most\nlatitudes exhibit a low abundance, the Equatorial Zone of Jupiter has an\nabundance of ammonia that is high and nearly uniform with depth. In parallel,\nthe Equatorial Zone is peculiar for its absence of lightning, which is\notherwise prevalent most everywhere else on the planet. We show that a model\naccounting for the presence of small-scale convection and water storms\noriginating in Jupiter's deep atmosphere accounts for the observations. Where\nstrong thunderstorms are observed on the planet, we estimate that the formation\nof ammonia-rich hail ('mushballs') and subsequent downdrafts can deplete\nefficiency the upper atmosphere of its ammonia and transport it efficiently to\nthe deeper levels. In the Equatorial Zone, the absence of thunderstorms shows\nthat this process is not occurring, implying that small-scale convection can\nmaintain a near-homogeneity of this region. A simple model satisfying mass and\nenergy balance accounts for the main features of Juno's MWR observations and\nsuccessfully reproduces the inverse correlation seen between ammonia abundance\nand the lightning rate as function of latitude. We predict that in regions\nwhere ammonia is depleted, water should also be depleted to great depths. The\nfact that condensates are not well mixed by convection until far deeper than\ntheir condensation level has consequences for our understanding of Jupiter's\ndeep interior and of giant-planet atmospheres in general.",

The analytical formulation reduces the optimization problem to an\neigenproblem, both for maximum deviation and minimum collision probability.
